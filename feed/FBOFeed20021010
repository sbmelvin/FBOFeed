<DESC>A longline catcher processor with a minimum registered length of 41.1m (135 ft), and a minimum continuous horsepower from the main engine of 1,000 is needed to perform longline fishing in statistical area 521 in March, July, and October of 2003.  The vessel must be able to maintain a cruising speed of 10 knots, and have sufficient fuel capacity to remain at sea for 30 days of constant operations. The vessel and crew must duplicate their previous fishing effort using the same gear, setting and hauling methods, and fishing strategies that vessel operators would normally follow during CDQ Pacific cod fisheries.  This charter is being done to evaluate catch accounting methods for estimating total weight removals of Pacific cod caught by CDQ longline catcher processors.  Fish caught during this charter may be retained and sold by the contractor.  All responsible, responsive offers will be considered.  This solicitation will only be available as a hard copy issued through the mail.   All requests for a solicitation should be made directly to the listed contacts above.  Solicitations are to be obtained by written request either faxed or emailed to Crystina Elkins.

<DESC>The National Nuclear Security Agency Nevada Operations Office (NNSA/NV) is seeking sources interested in the operation of cafeteria services on-site at the Nevada Support Facility (NSF) located at 232 Energy Way, North Las Vegas, Nevada. This is a secured facility and only authorized personnel may gain entry. This is a market survey for written information only. This is NOT a solicitation announcement for proposals. There is no solicitation available at this time. This is a market search whereby the Government is seeking written information only from sources interested in providing these services. A separate synopsis will be issued in the FedBizOpps when the solicitation is going to be issued. It is anticipated that a 12 month contract will be issued with up to four 12-month option periods. Although the NNSA/NV has not made a final decision as to contract type, a "no-cost" type contract is preferred. The resulting solicitation will be processed under full and open competition procedures. The North Las Vegas site currently has approximately 381 people and frequent visitors who could potentially utilize the cafeteria services. It is anticipated that 40%-to 60% may elect to eat at the cafeteria for breakfast or lunch. The service required will include breakfast, lunch and the provision of snacks and hot/cold beverages available at all times. The hours of operation for the cafeteria are 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. daily. Description of facilities: Main Level of NSF, 232 Energy Way, North Las Vegas, NV 89030. The square footage for the cafeteria is 5200. Seating capacity is 250 people. Cafeteria services will be provided 5 days per week, Monday through Friday except holidays observed by the Federal government. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to provide a variety of quality prepared foods. The contractor shall meet business and industry standards of quality and nutrition and comply and support the 1990 and all subsequent revisions of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines. The variety and appearance of food in the cafeteria on each operating day shall be consistent with approved food service industry standards for comparable "business and industry" cafeterias?.  The NNSA/NV requests interested parties to submit a one to three page synopsis describing your capabilities as a cafeteria services provider and the services (i.e menu) your firm could provide. All capability statements will be reviewed by the NNSA/NV. Creative approaches to providing the cafeteria requirements are encouraged. A tour of the cafeteria will be provided by the NNSA/NV on November 4, 2002 at 3:30 local time. In order to attend the tour offerors MUST contact the Contracting Officer in writing, providing the name of your firm and the number of people attending. Offerors not attending the tour may submit capability statements. The NNSA/NV does not intend to have a pre-solicitation conference. The Government will provide a dining area including tables and chairs. Trash and garbage is removed once after 4:00 p.m. from the dining area receptacles only. Utilities, including gas, electricity, water and sewer, and utility connections to include gas, electricity, water and sewer will be provided by the government.  Any interested firm should submit a capability statement to demonstrate the firm's qualifications/ability to provide the required services. The deadline for submission of the capability statement is November 19, 2002. The point of contact for this action is Beverly Colbert, telephone (702) 295-1466, E-mail: colbert@nv.doe.gov. Submissions should be sent to NNSA/NV, Contracts and Property Management Division, PO Box 98518, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8518.

This is a market research to locate possible sources for the repair of existing Varian Klystron Tubes: Varian p/n -VKX-7780E-1/2 inch; NSN: 5960-01-030-5345; 1630 Watt and Varian pnn -VKX-7780F-1; NSN: 5960-01-365-875 1; 830 Watt.  Both Klystron Tubes are part of the AN-TSC-85B-C & 93B-C; AN-TSC-94A-100A; AN-GSC-49 Tactical-Strategic Satellite Communication Terminals. Current-existing qualified source for the repair of these items is, Communications and Power Industries  -CPI- Ontario, Canada - Formerly Varian Canada Microwave Division. No other source has successfully repaired these tubes which must perform within the original system requirements to include the Defense Information Systems Agency -DISA- certification orig inally granted to the above Terminal configurations. These tubes were specifically designed for use with the above Terminals in the 1976 time-frame and, since then, support is solely through their repair. Exact-detailed design, manufacturing, test data res ides with CPI, Ind., who, through a wholesale buyout of Varian, acquired the data and resources.  These Klystron Tubes must maintain their form, fit and functional interchangeability with each other, thus providing a seamless transition -logistics/supply- for use across the above weapon systems. Any responses to this market survey must provide a copy of a purchase order -if the supplier was a vendor to a current source- or a statement from the current source demonstrating that the supplier can in fact suppl y the item. The response MUST also include documentation detailing how the acceptance testing of these Klystron Tubes was-will be accomplished and the test results. Source-s- meeting the above criteria will be required to warrant that the item supplied wil l satisfactorily perform when used for the purpose intended by the Army. Any-all responses must be through e-mail; Phone calls will not be accepted. Email Address:   Robert.Weir@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.  The deadline for response to this notice is 24 Octob er 2002.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Cancer Therapeutics Branch (CTB) plans to procure supplies and services for Synthesis of 2'-Alkoxy, 3'- deoxyphosphatidylinsolitol ether lipid analogues, from Axxora Laboratories, LLC,  6181 Cornerstone Court East, Suite 103, San Diego, California 92121-4727.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325411 and the business size standard is 750 employees.  The Signal Transduction Section of the CTB, CCR, NCI studies signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis and the therapeutic resistance of solid tumors.  The goals of the section are to identify clinically relevant kinases whose modification may alter tumor formation and/or growth, and to develop approaches to inhibit these identified kinases.  Akt (or protein kinase B (PKB)) is a well-characterized serine/threonine kinase that promotes cellular survival.  Akt can be activated in response to growth stimuli as well as stressful stimuli.  Activation requires phosphorylation of 2 amino acids, one in the activation domain and one in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif.  Phosphorylation of the site in the activation domain is dependent on the products of an upstream kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), phosphatidylinositol 3,4 bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP2 and PIP3 bind to pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt, which results in translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane, where the two phosphorylation events subsequently occur. Analysis of mice and human tissues show that Akt activation plays a role in tumor biology.   In an effort to develop small molecules against Akt without depending on crystallographic information on the structure of Akt, NCI is collaborating with Dr. Alan Kozikowski of Georgetown University and, scientic advisor to Axxora Laboratories, LLC, who has molecularly modeled the interaction of PIP2 and PIP3 with the PH domain of Akt, and has synthesized phosphatidylinositol (PI) ether lipid analogues that were designed to inhibit the binding of PIP2 and PIP3 to the PH domain of Akt, thereby inhibiting Akt activity.  NCI has screened 25 PI analogues that differed in substitutions at the inositol ring, and have identified 5 effective analogues with similar 2-alkoxy, 3'- deoxy substitutions on the inositol ring.  Each of these compounds inhibits Akt phosphorylation and activity in lung cancer and breast cancer cell lines that have high levels of endogenous Akt activity.  These compounds work effectively, with IC50 from 600nM-3?M.  Data suggest that these compounds might have utility as future cancer therapies.  The biologic studies and animal studies  require synthesis of approximately 100 mg of each effective compound (SH5, 6, 23, 24, and 25) as well as 100 mg of an ether lipid analogue that lacks an inositol ring and therefore serves as a negative control. Additionally, 10 mg amounts of each of the inositol head groups are  required. The NCI and Georgetown University are co-inventors of these compounds, and they can only be made efficiently by the team at Axxora Laboratories with the consultation of Dr. Kozikowski, developer of these compounds.  The compounds could eventually be used to treat cancer or other diseases characterized by Akt activation. Period of Performance: Upon award of purchase order through six (6) months; FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) applies to this requirement.  Axxora Laboratories, LLC., is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the expertise to synthesize the compounds needed to continue the existing experiment in progress. Dr. Kozikowski is the director of the Drug Discovery Program of Georgetown University and founder of Axxora Laboratories, LLC, and has published extensively on the synthesis of compounds designed to inhibit various molecular targets.  Importantly, Dr. Kozikowski was the first to discover and synthesize 3' deoxyphosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogues that serve as precursors for the 2'-alkoxy-, 3'- deoxyphosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogues.  Dr. Kozikowski's  compound synthesis is innovative, elegant, consistent, and reliable.  The compounds themselves are unique and have not been described in the literature.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington DC time) on October 25, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>I. Introduction - Bechtel, BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI), Management & Operating Contractor of the INEEL, is requesting an EOI from prospective Vendors to provide turnkey equipment and services to load, transport, and unload two irradiated TRIGA (a registered trademark of General Atomics) fuel elements from Texas A&M University to Argonne National Laboratory ? East (ANL-E).  This EOI shall serve as a method of screening potential Vendors; allowing only qualified candidates to receive a formal Request for Proposal (RFP).  

II. Background - The INEEL is an U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory located approximately 50 miles from Idaho Falls, Idaho.  The INEEL is tasked to make contractual arrangements to move the fuel from Texas A&M University to ANL-E.  Both the University and the ANL-E facilities have limited crane capabilities and other features to handle shielded casks.  Therefore, it is desired to obtain  the equipment and services to perform these fuel transfer activities using contracted equipment and services personnel.  Scope includes providing required cask loading and unloading equipment (e.g., dry transfer system, forklifts, portable cranes, fuel element grapple, etc.), licensed cask, cask internals, cask loading equipment, and related equipment (e.g., lifting yokes, lid slings, pressure test equipment, and cask drying equipment). Additionally, the Vendor shall be  responsible to provide personnel to load and unload the cask and to arrange and contract all transportation activities in accordance with applicable DOT/NRC regulations.  The Vendor?s equipment must interface with the shipping and receiving facilities? normal fuel handling configuration.  University and ANL-E personnel will be responsible for required interface activities at their respective facilities.  

III. Performance Criteria  - Information is sought to identify prospective Vendors with the capability to provide a total equipment and personnel services package to load, transport, and unload the two irradiated TRIGA elements being moved from Texas A&M University to ANL-E.  Off-loading the two fuel elements from the transport cask at the ANL-E hot cell facilities and removal of the cask and associated equipment from the premises will constitute completion of the task.  Work is anticipated to be completed prior to 12/31/2002.   

IV. Submittal - It is the intent of this EOI to identify candidate Vendors who have demonstrated experience and capability in handling and coordinating transportation activities of irradiated TRIGA fuels.  The submittal shall identify Vendor qualifications to provide the personnel and equipment to complete the described fuel movement in a proficient manner with minimal delays.  Prospective vendors shall provide:  1) A description of similar jobs reflecting experience with transporting irradiated TRIGA and similar nuclear materials.  2) A description of available equipment (casks, transfer systems, etc) to support the activities described under Section III, Performance Criteria.  3) A minimum of two references of past clients of Vendor?s firm who can validate past experience of similar irradiated TRIGA fuel handling activities and capabilities.  4) An estimate of the time required to mobilize, start, and complete the fuel movement activity after a contract is awarded.  Again, it is the intent of this EOI to solicit formal proposals (through the RFP process) from candidate firms who successfully comply with the requirements of this EOI.  Please provide your EOI submittal to Renee Wuska , BBWI Subcontract Administrator, P.O. Box 1625, 1955 Freemont Ave., Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3975 by close-of-business, 10/21/02.  If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Ms. Wuska at (208) 526-4026 or email at nee@inel.gov.  Technical questions must be submitted in writing (U.S. Mail or e-mail).

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to release an RFP for multiple Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contracts for the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (Female Contraceptive Clinical Trial Topic Area).  The NIH, NICHD is the lead Federal agency for the conduct of basic, clinical and epidemiological research to develop new contraceptives and to evaluate existing methods of contraception and reproductive health.  The Center for Population Research (CPR), within NICHD, was established in 1968 by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, with the important goal of developing new contraceptives through the use of contracts and grants. Within CPR, the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has long supported several preclinical contraceptive testing facilities, as well as facilities for chemical and peptide synthesis.  To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996 CRHB established the initial NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) in order to conduct Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new female contraceptive methods.  

The NICHD CCTN is an important component of the CRHB contraceptive development capability.  Products that have undergone synthesis and successful pre-clinical testing, either through the CRHB formulation and testing facilities or through outside sources, are candidates for clinical testing in the CCTN. The CCTN is particularly valuable for providing a venue for testing new contraceptive drugs and devices that have been developed by small companies that lack the resources to support large-scale Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new female contraceptive methods.  

The new CCTN, that will operate under Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contracts, will be able to rapidly develop protocols and initiate clinical trials shortly after candidate products have completed the necessary preclinical testing.  Both female and male contraceptives will undergo Phase I, II, and III clinical trials in the new CCTN.  It is estimated that the new CCTN will consist of approximately 12 sites capable of performing female contraceptive clinical trials and approximately four sites capable of performing male contraceptive clinical trials.  Please be advised that the NICHD is issuing separate RFPs for each Topic Area (Female Contraceptive Clinical Trials & Male Contraceptive Clinical Trials) in order to better facilitate and coordinate the evaluation of Proposals.  This announcement is for the RFP for the Female Contraceptive Trials Topic Area, only.

Offerors may choose to propose on either RFP (Female Contraceptive Trials & Male Contraceptive Trials) or both RFPs depending on their organization?s capabilities.  However, please be advised that the NICHD will not accept combined proposals (Female & Male) from offerors who wish to propose on both RFPs.  Those offerors that propose on both RFPs must provide separate individual Technical and Business Proposals in response to each RFP.

Organizations that believe they have the capabilities and recruitment ability necessary to participate in this network, may access the Request for Proposal(s), RFP-NICHD-2003-04, electronically on the FedBizOpps website, at http://www.eps.gov/spg/HHS/NIH/NICHD/postdate_1.html, on or about November 1, 2002. Please note that the NICHD does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP. The NICHD also reserves the right to cancel the requirement at any time prior to contract award.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for computing gaseous transmission and path radiance in the MODIS Middle Infrared and Long Wave Infrared Bands.  These bands are needed for the implementation of atmospheric corrections in an operational context that can use high spatial resolution atmospheric profiles generated by a combination of MODIS and NCEP Data.  The accuracy needed for those corrections require the development of a band absorption/emission model that accounts for the variation of absorption and thermal emission pressure, humidity and temperature along the path, which is critical in the long wavelengths.  Those models and coefficients can be derived and validated using MODTRAN code that is currently used in computing gaseous transmission and path radiance at coarse resolution (1 degree).  The delivery should include the correction code for MODIS Bands as well as some comparison with the MODTRAN results for some judiciously selected test cases. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Analytical & Computational Research Inc.  ACRi has the specific expertise required to conduct this study.  This study is aimed at quickly developing a software package to perform operation atmospheric correction in the middle thermal infrared using atmospheric profile at coarse resolution from the NCEP database.  These are refined to a higher resolution using atmospheric parameter sensed by MODIS at the 1km resolution (e.g. water vapor).  The proposed work to be accomplished relies heavily on having experimented with operational atmospheric correction methods in the middle and thermal infrared and having expertise of the MODIS data that are still relatively new.  ACRi is in a unique position to meet our project needs in a timely manner with a staff experienced in this area position to meet our project needs in a timely manner with a staff experienced in this area of atmospheric correction in the infrared wavelengths for moderate resolution satellites. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 18, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to inform interested parties that the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, Maryland, intends to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement, N00019-02-G-0350, on a sole source basis with Raytheon Company, 7700 Arlington Blvd., Falls Church, Virginia in support of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Tactical Control Systems (TCS) program.  The order will consist of the performance of studies and design analysis in support of the Phase I and Phase II Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) program.  The near term objective is to develop an interface device that will allow a level 2 communication between the Mission Control Element (MCE) and the Tactical Support Center (TSC) for the Global Hawk Demonstration Program.  In the development of the interface device, a Tactical Control System (TCS) product, it is the Navy's goal to reuse as much of the TCS software (Block 2 Version 2) as practical and to identify feasible changes to the TSC and/or TCS for the optimum interface.  The long term goal is to achieve a fully integrated and seamless TCS/TSC system which will be used by the future BAMS UAV.  This future TCS/TSC system is envisioned to provide level 4 UAV control.  The purpose of this BOA study is to determine the feasibility and options for the fully integrated TCS/TSC.  Successful completion of this effort requires intimate knowledge of the TCS core hardware and software, various UAV related systems and the relationship of UAVs within the air reconnaissance architecture.  Raytheon Company is the only known source that possesses the peculiar engineering data, knowledge of TCS design and operation requirements, capability, and expertise required to successfully provide these supplies and services in an accurate and timely manner.  The estimated period of performance is July 2002 to January 2003.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to warnerlm@navair.navy.mil.  See Notes 22 and 26.

As a part of the cost of the lease, a maintenance agreement should be included to cover 
the same period of time as the lease. The maintenance agreement will provide regularly
Scheduled preventive maintenance as required by the manufacturer, which includes parts and labor. The maintenance agreement should cover repairs and maintenance due to equipment/parts failure caused by normal usage of equipment.
After placing a call for service, the response time should be no longer 24 hours.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Government intends to buy 6 each of NSN 4920-01-098-0889RN; PN 68D290041-1001.
The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns. 
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number. The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

The approximate issue date will be 1 August 2002.  Written procedure will be used for this solicitation and posted on FedBizOps.  To:  Williams Int?l Co LLC, Walled Lake MI 48390-0200.

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(C) (1).  Justification:  Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.  Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as may be detailed in the solicitation.  Note:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.  Note:  Faxed solicitation requests can be submitted to OC-ALC/PKXDA, Tinker AFB OK 73145-3015, FAX NUMBER  (405) 739-3656.  See Note (s) 26.

<DESC>Solicitation RFP 200-0715-NC is hereby amended as follows:

Remove the following paragraph from Section B:

*Services are required primarily for full-time resident inmate days; however, a percentage of total estimated inmate days may be used for live-out programs.  The estimated number of inmate days set forth above may be broken down into the following estimated percentages:

Fixed price per Regular Inmate days:  80%

Home COnfinement Inmate days:  19%

Furloughes Inmate days: 1%

Insert the following paragraph in place of the above referenced paragraph in Section B:

Services are required primarily for full-time resident inmate days; however, all eligible residents shall be placed on home confinement.  Home confinement is considered an essential part of the community program experience as it helps instill in inmates responsibilities necessary for the successful transition from institution to community living.  Through continual monitoring, the Bureau of Prisons will ensure inmates are placed on home confinement as appropriate, taking corrective actions when so indicated.  It is expected that inmates shall be placed on home confinement upon meeting programming requirements and their elibibiity date, with the consent of the Community Corrections Manager.

Per diem rates for inmates placed on home confinement shall be one-half the full contract per diem rate.  In the event the per diem rate does not divide evenly, the Bureau shall round-up the per diem rate, (i.e. a per diem rate of $67.53 divided by 2 = $33.765.  By rounding up, the home confinement per diem rate would be $33.77).

The following language shall be included in Chapter 10, Paragraph 3(c):

Contractors are not requried to provide meals, medical treatment, clothing or incidental laundry services or other subsistence items to residents o home confinement.

Contractors shall maintain documentation of all staff contracts with residents on home confinement.

The contractor is not required to reserve a bed at the center 
for a resident on home confinement.  The per diem rate for residents on home confinement shall be one-half the regular per diem rate.

The contractor shall collect subsistence from a resident on home confinement at a rate of 25% of their gross income.  The weekly subsistence collected shall not exceed the per diem rate established for home confinement times seven.

<DESC>Roving Sands 2003 (RS03) MSI Demonstration ROVING SANDS 2003 (RS03) MULTI-SOURCE INTEGRATOR (MSI) DEMONSTRATION.  The Single Integrated Air Picture System Engineer Task Force (SIAP SE TF), in concert with United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) and Joint Air and Missile Defense Organization (JTAMDO), solicits interest for participation in controlled field and laboratory demonstrations to baseline the performance of existing Air Warfare Command and Control (C2) Multi-Source Integrator (MSI) systems. Using a multi-phase, multi-event approach, these demonstrations will use live-data inputs from military field-environment exercises, as well as recorded inputs during subsequent event phases in a laboratory environment.  A Phase One event was successfully conducted during Joint Combat Identification Evaluation Team exercise in April 2002 (JCIET 02), requiring passive operation  of each participating MSI system (no output to the data links, no local sensor integration).  Phase Two and Phase Three MSI Systems Demonstrations will be conducted in the laboratory environment.  Specifically, a Phase Two event will be conducted in Feb-Mar 03 and will require passive operation, but the systems will be able to use local sensors if/as applicable.  A Phase Three event has yet to be planned, but this event will place the MSI systems into the data networks as active participants, enabling MSI nodes at each sensor to share data among each other.  During all phases, quantitative comparisons of the various MSI systems’ output file (i.e., composite track-file databases) to the available truth data will be the criteria for determining baseline performance.  Results from each of the three phases of the MSI Demonstration will be used to provide recommendations for operati onal, technical, and interoperability standards for an objective integration/fusion capability that map to current (and influence future) Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-validated requirements.  INDUSTRY DAY BRIEFING FOR RS03 MSI DEMONSTRATION. Interest is hereby solicited for participation in the RS03 MSI demonstration to be conducted in June 2003 at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), NM.  This is a Phase One event that will involve the use of RS03 live-fly data as input to each of the participating MSI systems.  Quantitative comparisons of the participants’ output files to the available truth data will be the criteria for determining system performance.  An Industry Day Briefing highlighting the RS03 MSI demonstration objectives and participation requirements will be held 13 Nov 02 at BAE Systems, Suite 100, Century II Bldg in Crystal City (2351 Jefferson Davis  Hwy) from 0900 -1600.  After the Industry Day briefing, the Government will conduct a group question and answer session, followed by individual company breakout conferences, where attendees can discuss with the Government team their company specific issues related to participation.  A SECRET security clearance will be required for vendor personnel attending this industry event. See instructions below for submitting the required visit request/security clearance information.   PLANNING DAY FOR MSI PHASE TWO PARTICIPANTS.  In conjunction with the RS03 MSI Demonstration Industry Day, a group planning session for the contractors participating in the MSI Phase Two Demonstration is scheduled from 0900 - 1200 noon on 14 Nov 02 at the same BAE Systems location.  The Government will conduct a short briefing followed by an open forum for participants to get a clear understanding of the  Phase Two demonstration lab setup and testing process.  If participating contractors request individual private sessions with Government personnel, those will be conducted commencing at 1300.   NOTICE OF ATTENDANCE.  Those companies seeking to participate in the 13-14 Nov 02 Industry Day Briefing should contact LCDR John H. Windom NLT Friday, 1 Nov 02, by phone (202)-781-4965 or by e-mail at WindomJH@NAVSEA.NAVY.MIL.   SECURITY CLEARANCE FOR INDUSTRY DAY BRIEFING. SECRET security clearance is required for the Industry Day Briefing and sessions with the Government’s MSI Team on  13-14 Nov 02.  Fax visit request/security clearance verification NLT 6 Nov 02 to BAE Systems Applied Technologies Inc, 80 M St. SE, ATTN: Security Officer, Washington, DC 20003; Voice (202) 203-6000,  FAX: (202) 203-6069.

A valid photo ID with SSN is required for identification/verification upon check in.  NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO PARTICIPATE.  Vendors interested in participating in the RS03 MSI Demonstration must submit their notifications of interest to participate and both name and physical/functional description of their MSI systems by Wednesday, 15 Jan 03.  Via written notification, contractors will be invited to participate and informed of the RS03 demonstration/test schedule.  A SECRET security clearance will be required for personnel attending the RS03 MSI Demonstration.  Any vendors/systems not selected for participation in this event will be provided written notice wit h supporting rationale for their exclusion from this phase of the MSI Demonstrations.  GOAL OF THE MSI DEMONSTRATIONS. The goal of the multi-phased, multi-event demonstrations is to baseline the performance of existing Air Warfare Command and Control MSI systems.  Results will be used to provide recommendations for standards for an objective capability that map to (and influence future) JROC-validated requirements.  The Government will derive objective, quantitative performance criteria for this experiment from Theater Air and Missile Defense (TAMD) and Combat Identification (CID) Capstone Requirements Documents (CRD).  The data analysis will be performed based on ground truth data, inputs from networks, and data recorded by each MSI system participating in the demonstrations. The Government will use the criteria to compare ground truth with the composite track-file of each  MSI device, to gain a better understanding of individual MSI system’s capabilities. The Government will conduct data analysis and will be responsible for generating quick-look and formal performance reports. A list of applicable documents that form the basis of the SIAP attributes and the Government’s analysis for these demonstrations is available upon request. The intent of these demonstrations is for data collection purposes and will not result in a contract award.  BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS MSI SYSTEMS DEMONSTRATIONS.  Multi-Source Integration (MSI) is the process that (1) performs association/correlation and fusion of target track and measurement data received over a variety of tactical and intelligence data networks (e.g., Radar, CEC, Data Link, National Intel, SIGINT, COMINT, IFF) to create and maintain a composite track-file database, and (2) combines a priori data with  dynamic data.  The MSI systems may have organic sensors that contribute to the composite track-file database, and they may also have the capability to both transmit and receive data on the various data links.  Previous studies have demonstrated that fusion/correlation techniques, algorithms, and technologies are mature, but there exists a lack of common quantitative standards for assessing the performance of candidate MSI systems.  The studies recommended development of technical, operational, and interoperability standards for an objective integration/fusion capability. An MSI Systems Phase One event was successfully conducted during JCIET 02. The Government provided the following live data feeds to three participating MSI systems: Link 11, Link 16, CEC, ARSR-4, and STARS.  The Government also recorded the available live-data feeds and the truth data (e.g., TSPI) from all JCI ET-network participants. The recorded data is currently being used for post-event, quantitative performance analysis, and selected recordings from this data will be used as input feeds for the participating systems in the Phase Two laboratory event to be conducted at the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JTIC), Ft Huachuca, AZ in Feb/Mar 2003.  RS03 MSI DEMONSTRATION DATA HANDLING AND SECURITY. A Government team will be the primary operators of all Government-furnished equipment (e.g., data input feeds, interfaces, and recorders) and will ensure strict control of data and results to protect against release of classified information, as well as, proprietary interests and intellectual property.  Each participant will be required to provide a copy of (or access to) its system’s output file (i.e., track database data-extraction file).  Details concerning security procedures f or the handling, storage, and processing of classified materials will be provided to participants that take part in the event.  CONSIDERATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN RS03 MSI DEMONSTRATION. The Government’s intent is to provide a forum for the conduct of these demonstrations and a means of data collection and analysis.  Individual participants will not receive funding from the Government to support personnel expenses or the transportation, storage, operation, maintenance, or repair of their system and/or equipment.  Specifically, for the RS03 event, the Government will provide the following to each invited participant:  (1) Opportunity to demonstrate their product and to influence the development of an objective-capability standard for MSI.  (2) Copies of the live-data feeds used as input sources for the demonstration (Subject to use and non-disclosure terms and conditions of  participation.). (3) Workspace area at WSMR during the event.  (4) Results of the Government’s evaluation of the participant’s own system’s data output file. (5) Access to the Government’s software-based performance evaluation tool (PET) used to evaluate the system’s output file.  RS03 MSI DEMONSTRATION PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS. To be considered eligible for participation in the demonstrations, vendors must meet the following requirements: (1) By Wednesday, 15 Jan 03, provide the Government with notification of intent and/or interest in participating in the RS03 event, and furnish both the name and a physical/functional description of their MSI system (not code level; describe as a black box). (2) Participant’s MSI system must function at the Command and Control (C2) system level (e.g., link level) and support the use of more than one type of input source. The Government w ill specify the data feeds and formats to be used in the proposed RS03 event. (3) Participants will be responsible for all expenses associated with participation in the demonstration and to honor all terms and conditions of a Bailment Agreement, which will specify details of the demonstration including formats for common inputs such as requirements for electrical and physical layer interface, data link layer, network layer (addressing), and transport layer (format), security classification guidance and applicable data handling, use and non-disclosure requirements. (4) During the demonstration, participants must be willing to provide all equipment and personnel required to operate and support their system during the demonstration; provide access to output data (track database data-extraction file ) for recording purposes; and be available to support and participate in data reduc tion effort (if/as needed). (5) Participating companies must be able to satisfy SECRET (U.S. Only) security clearance requirements.

<SUBJECT>99--REVOLUTIONARY VEHICLES:  CONCEPTS AND SYSTEMS COMPETITION
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Aerospace Vehicle Systems Technology Office, is seeking U.S. commercial aerospace firms that would be interested in co-sponsoring the 2002-2003 Revolutionary Vehicles:  Concepts and Systems Competition.  We are seeking firms that would be interested in assisting with reviewing student proposals, sponsoring awards, and/or providing university level student internships.   The Aerospace Vehicle Systems Technology Office and the Office of Education at Langley Research Center, in partnership with NASA Glenn Research Center's Green Efficient Aircraft Propulsion project, is sponsoring the Revolutionary Vehicles:	Concepts and Systems Competition for 2002-2003.	This national competition has two divisions, university and high school.  The high school awards will be presented at the North Carolina Festival of Flight in May of 2003.  The university level award presentations will be made at the Experimental Aircraft Association's AirVenture in August 2003.  University student internships at NASA are administered in conjunction with the NASA Langley Office of Education and typically last for 10 weeks during the summer. The current competition grew out of the national university design competition that was formerly sponsored by the NASA Advanced General Aviation Transport Experiment (AGATE) project. After successfully engaging hundreds of university students for seven years, the AGATE program competition ended in the summer of 2001.  Last year, 2001-2002, the NASA General Aviation Programs Office sponsored a university level, all general aviation competition that drew over 100 students from eleven universities.  That competition inspired a broader, more robust effort to reach not only university campuses, but also high school classrooms with Revolutionary Vehicle ideas.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Public Forum on
<DESC>The U.S. Dept. of Commerce and the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) are pleased to announce a public forum on "Efforts to Update Federal and State Packaging and Labeling Laws and Regulations to Give Manufacturers the Option to Voluntarily Label Packages with Only Metric Units." The forum will be held Thursday, November 7, 2002, from 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM at U.S. Dept. of Commerce Auditorium, Herbert C. Hoover Bldg., 14th & Constitution Ave., NW, Washington, D.C. 

The forum is free and open to the public but space will be limited.  Advanced registration required - deadline Nov. 1, 2002.  The complete forum notice and registration form is contained in the attached flyer.

Through this forum NIST & NCWM will seek to provide an opportunity for consumers, manufacturers, packagers, exporters and importers, retailers, federal and state agencies, and other interested parties to express their views on removing restrictions on voluntary, metric-only labeling.

NIST & NCWM will present information on the progress in the states to allow voluntary, metric-only labeling and a proposal to amend the U.S. Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) so all packagers have the option of using only metric units on package labels.

Since 1992, the FPLA has required consumer package labels to list both metric and inch-pound units.  Either measurement unit may appear first on the label.  NIST & NCWM believe that updating current federal regulatory requirements to give manufacturers the option to market products in the United States labeled only in metric units is now necessary.

While the FPLA, and other Federal regulations, govern the labeling requirements for many consumer products, many other products fall under State requirements.  Since January 1, 2000, the Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation (UPLR), as adopted by the NCWM, has allowed the option of metric-only quantity declarations on consumer packages.

NIST welcomes concerned businesses' participation and help in working to complete this vital step to help consumers in the United States better understand, and use, the already increasingly present decimal-based metric system to make more informed value comparisons.
