The objective of this pilot program is to promote the participation by and prepare HBCU/MIs for the mainstream research program of MDA/AS.  This program does not replace the main MDA/AS research program that is available to all universities.  The goal of this effort is to attract researchers at HBCU/MIs toward technical endeavors that will improve their competitiveness in winning regular support from the main MDA/AS research program.  Selection for contract award will be based on a competitive evaluation using the following criteria:  (1) Technical: (a)  Anticipated benefits of the basic research or applied/exploratory research effort to the MDA mission, (b)  The scientific/ technical quality of the basic research or applied/exploratory research proposal and its relevance to the topic description, with special emphasis on its innovation and originality, and with consideration for the potential of the successful completion leading to further support by the main MDA/AS research program, and (c) Qualifications of the Principal Investigator, other key staff and consultants, if any, and adequacy of available or obtainable instrumentation and facilities; (2)  Management:  Adequacy of management planning and controls; and (3)  Cost:  Cost will be evaluated as follows:  The proposals will be evaluated against the government?s estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed.  Total evaluated probable cost consists of the government?s estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offerors? proposals, to include the government?s assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, and other cost related factors.   Each proposal will be evaluated on the basis of all the above factors.   The technical quality of the proposal is significantly more important than the management factor.  The technical sub-factors are of equal importance.  The cost factor is less important than the technical and management factors.  The primary basis for proposal selection shall be technical and management merit, availability of funds, and program balance.

<DESC>The Direct Reporting Program Manager Advanced Amphibious Assault (AAA) has a requirement for development of Training Systems (including simulators) for the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAAV) program. 

Since the AAAV will be developed concurrently with the AAAV Training Systems, the development of both must be fully integrated to ensure maximum fidelity to vehicle performance.  Complete access to the AAAV design, including ongoing changes through 2007 is required to ensure that the configurations of the vehicle and the simulators are congruent.  Therefore, the Marine Corps Systems Command intends to contract with General Dynamics Land Systems (operating through its General Dynamics Amphibious Systems division in Woodbridge, VA), the developer of the AAAV vehicle for the development of the training system.
 
The development work is estimated to take place during the period Fourth Quarter FY03 through Second Quarter FY06, and will include development and testing of four types of Training Systems (Driver Training System, Gunnery Training System, Maintenance Part Task Trainers, and Communications/ Navigation Training System) and delivery of the first unit of each of the systems.  The development contract will also include development of curricula and Interactive Media Instruction (IMI). 

Any questions shall be submitted, in writing, to Ms. Denise L. Randolph, Contracting Officer, 991 Annapolis Way, Woodbridge, VA 22191 or e-mailed to RandolphD@aaav.usmc.mil.  Mail sent using the Quantico address may be substantially delayed.

<DESC>DODEA is responsible for ensuring the security of students at all times and has a requirement to enhance the security on its school buses.  DoDDS-Europe (DoDDS-E)  requires an Automated Vehicle Location (AVL) system for installation on buses transporting DoDDS students to and from school.  The AVL system shall provide each School Bus Office (SBO) with the capability to remotely track and report historical data for the travelled routes of all school vehicles within a geographic footprint; to identify if a bus is deviating from a pre-defined route; to communicate between traveling vehicles and data collection points via GSM or Satellite communications (55 units only); to track vehicles, to the secondary street level, within any of the designated travel areas; and have a duress alarm capability.  Offerors selected to provide this system shall be responsible for producing the AVL systems, installing them on the buses and for training the school bus operators on the use and care of the systems installed on the buses.  In addition, offerors shall be responsible for setting up the monitoring stations at the SBOs, providing all of the infrastructure necessary to transfer information from the buses to the monitoring stations, maintaining the monitoring stations and the communication links to those monitoring stations, and for training SBO personnel on the use of the monitoring stations.  The AVL shall include a duress alarm that the vehicle operator or other designated person can activate.  The duress alarm shall be audibly and visually transmitted to the Base Station.  AVL equipment will be installed at the SBOs at Hohenfels and Vilseck/Grafenwoehr, Germany and a test phase will occur from end of March 03 to mid-April 03.  After successful test completion, remaining units will be installed from mid-April 03 through end of August 03 at other locations in Germany, England, Italy, Turkey,  Spain, Belgium, Bahrain, and possibly Greece. The AVL System shall consist of multiple components including an AVL unit and its associated hardware/software/firmware, an AVL monitoring workstation (Base Station) and its associated software. There are two types of motor pools used within the DoDDS-E runs: vehicles that are constant and always used on DoDDS-E runs, and vehicles that are rotated within an inventory.  For vehicles that will always be used on DoDDS-E runs, all related AVL equipment will be installed on the vehicle and the AVL unit will have a fixed-mount configuration.   For vehicles that are rotated daily from a motor pool, antenna(s) and power plugs, except the AVL unit, would be installed on all vehicles in the motor pool.  At the time a vehicle is chosen for use, the vehicle operator will carry a portable AVL unit on board and plug it in.  All equipment shall be communicating between the vehicle and the Base Station using GSM technology.  However, the cellular communication capability is not always available or reliable within specific regions in Europe, therefore, there is a need to have a backup method of communications on a limited number of units.  This redundant communications path shall be via satellite communications (SATCOM) for 55 units in Hohenfels, Eifel and Baumholder, Germany.  The planned contract type is firm fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with a one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods. The procurement will be conducted on an unrestricted basis under full and open competition.  Contract award will be made using best value source selection procedures.  The solicitation will be available on or about November 27, 2002.  DEPO is issuing this solicitation electronically.  A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for 11 Dec 02 in Germany.  Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.eps.gov or hard copies will be available at the District Transportation Supervisors offices upon request.

<DESC>The U.S. Navy intends to award a sole-source, cost plus fixed fee order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-00-G-0325 to Raytheon Company, Tucson, AZ, for sustaining engineering efforts for HARM Queued Six Degrees of Freedom (Q6DOF) simulation validation support through the HARM PNU DT/DT Assist and OT Programs.  The sustaining effort will include flight results analysis and comparison with simulation predictions. Mismatches between the two will be investigated. Flight software, functional design, and hardware problems will be documented and reported to the PNU team for resolution. Simulation modeling problems will be further investigated to determine the root cause of the model deficiency. Model improvements will be developed where feasible. The Q6DOF will be updated with the new models, new comparisons with the flight results will be made, and the simulation will be re-issued if required. White papers will be written describing the anomaly, the model deficiency, the model refinement, and a comparison of the updated simulation with the flight results. The focus of the effort will be on improvements to the simulation, which improve the accuracy of the simulation predictions. Improvements to the usability of the simulation will be a lower priority and will only be done if time and schedule permits.

<DESC>The Space & Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) is interested in receiving proposals for projects that offer potential for advancement and improvement of Navy operations. Please note that this is an announcement to declare SPAWAR's role in competitive funding of meritorious research across a spectrum of disciplines. This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). No request for proposal (RFP), solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. This announcement will remain open until replaced by a successor BAA for approximately one year from the date of publication. Proposals may be submitted any time during this period. Awards may take the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements,or other transaction agreements, as appropriate. Proposal submission is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. All interested responsible sources may submit a proposal. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Institutions (including Hispanic Serving Institutions and Tribal Colleges and Universities), as well as Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (including Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses), and Women-Owned Small Businesses are encouraged to participate. Topic:  Specific topics of interest will appear on the SPAWAR E-Commerce page at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  Click on "Headquarters," then "Open Solicitations."  Topics will be added as needed. Proposal Preparation: Before preparing proposals, potential offerors are strongly encouraged to contact the point of contact listed in the specific BAA topic. The SPAWAR long range baa is a competitive solicitation. Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation must cite the BAA number and the topic name on the proposal cover page. Proposals should also be accompanied by a completed certification package which can be found in the file, "Representations and Certifications for Contracts." For grant proposals and proposals for cooperative agreements or other transaction agreements (other than for prototypes), the certification package is entitled, "Certifications for Grants and Agreements." For grant awards, it is anticipated that the selected proposal will be incorporated by reference into the grant award. For contract and agreement awards, it is anticipated that the proposed statement of work (SOW) will be incorporated as an attachment to the resultant award instrument. To this end, such proposals must include a severable, self-standing SOW without any proprietary restrictions, which can be attached to the contract or agreement award. Successful offerors not already registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) will be required to register in CCR prior to award of any grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other transaction agreement. Information on CCR registration is available at https://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil/. All proposals must be submitted electronically in accordance with the file entitled "Electronic Proposal Preparation Instruction." If it is anticipated that access to classified material will be required during contract performance, the offeror is requested to clearly identify such need in the technical proposal. Pre-proposals or "White Papers" are frequently desired before the submission of final proposals. Read the particular BAA topic for specific information. Points of Contact Questions of a technical nature should be submitted to the point of contact listed in the BAA topic.  If no specific point of contact is listed, contact David Bodner (619) 524-7193 the Contracting Officer. Evaluation of Proposals Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a scientific/technical review. Evaluations will be conducted using the evaluation criteria listed in the individual topic.  If the topic contains no evaluation criteria, the evaluation will be conducted using the following criteria, all of which are of equal importance: (1) overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; (2) potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to the agency's specific mission; (3) the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (4) the qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader and key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (5) the realism of the proposed cost and availability of funds. For contract proposals, the socio-economic merits of the proposal will also be an evaluation criterion. Technical and cost proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-5 and 15.207. Government personnel will perform the evaluation of technical and cost proposals. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants. However, proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel. Each support contractor's employee having access to technical and cost proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any proposal submissions. SPAWAR reserves the right to fund all, some, or none of the proposals received under this BAA. SPAWAR provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.

<DESC>This procurement contract is a set-aside for small business concerns.  Large businesses will not be considered.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620.  The size is $6.0 million annual average.  Firm, fixed price Architect-Engineering (A/E) Services are required under this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for implementation and support of Environmental Management Systems (EMS), the Environmental Quality Assessment Program (EQA), the Navy Environmental Software (NES), and Emergency Planning Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), Pollution Prevention, and Hazardous Material Management Services in the Eastern United States, primarily in the Washington DC area.  The government's preference is to award to one firm; however, given the technical complexity of the contract, if there are not enough qualified candidates, the government reserves the right to award two contracts.  The objective is to provide services in support of the Navy's EMS/EQA Program, the EPCRA, Pollution Prevention, and Hazardous Material Management Programs.   A secondary requirement will be for general Environmental Engineering Services for all environmental regulations.  Required services include: maintenance and update of Navy EQA Software (NES) and checklists; developing and/or reviewing environmental policies; conducting gap analyses; conducting environmental surveys to complete an aspect analysis for all environmental processes, operations, sites, equipment, and waste streams at an installation; determining significance of impacts; prioritization of identified environmental aspects; recommending objectives and targets to ensure commitment to environmental policies; and developing or utilizing existing databases to provide for storage/analysis of EMS information and for EQA program support.  Other requirements include development of standard operating procedures (SOPs); point of use checklists; developing policy and planning documents; and implementing management systems designed to enhance and improve the environmental compliance programs and environmental performance at naval installations within Naval Facility Command's (NAVFAC) area of responsibility. The A/E shall also conduct EMS reviews/audits as well as implementation and/or progress reviews to examine the management systems at the installations to ensure they conform to a specified standard, such as ISO 14000, the Navy EMS policy issued by the CNO (OPNAVINST 5090.1B), EQA/EMS guidance manual or any other standards as designated by Navy technical personnel.  The A/E may be asked to develop a report (or provide specific input) to document the effectiveness of a base's EMS once the EMS review/audit has been completed.  The input or report may also recommend continuous improvement measures necessary.  Other required services may include developing and providing training in support of the EMS/EQA development/implementation.  The A/E should also be prepared to provide support to naval activities for the Navy's Environmental Quality Assessment program, along with developing and/or reviewing an Internal Assessment Plan (IAP) as well as an External Assessment Plan (EAP).  The A/E may be required to provide technical support to Navy assessment teams conducting compliance reviews to identify symptoms of ineffective management processes; assisting the Navy during external assessments to review management concepts, EMS activities, and compliance programs.  The A/E may be required to prepare a report or to provide input for a report developed by the Navy assessment team to document the base's compliance programs and/or EMS program.  The A/E may be required to perform other tasks in support of the EQA/EMS program. 

Maintenance of the NES may include, but is not limited to, writing or modifying computer coding, updating and creating checklists for federal, state, and local regulations; adding features to the software; modifying software functions; and maintaining the software for compliance and EMS evaluations.  The NES checklists shall be capable of being imported into the NES.   Other required tasks may include providing training for NES, maintaining a website for NES software, technical assistance, and keeping the information in the software current.

<DESC>100% SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.  

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to issue an RFP for an Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contract for a Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center (SCCC) for the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN).  The RFP will be a 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710 and the corresponding small business size standard is 500 employees or less.

The NIH, NICHD is the lead Federal agency for the conduct of basic, clinical and epidemiological research to develop new contraceptives and to evaluate existing methods of contraception and reproductive health.  The Center for Population Research (CPR), within NICHD, was established in 1968 by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, with the important goal of developing new contraceptives through the use of contracts and grants. Within CPR, the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has long supported several preclinical contraceptive testing facilities, as well as facilities for chemical and peptide synthesis.  To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996 CRHB established the initial NICHD CCTN in order to conduct Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new female contraceptive methods.  

The SCCC for the NICHD CCTN is an important component of the CRHB contraceptive development capability.  Products that have undergone formulation and successful pre-clinical testing, either through the CRHB formulation and testing facilities or through outside sources, are candidates for clinical testing in the CCTN.  The CCTN is particularly valuable for providing a venue for testing new contraceptive drugs and devices that have been developed by small companies that lack the resources to support large-scale clinical trials. This acquisition will be a recompetition of the SCCC for the CCTN that has been funded under a Cost plus Fixed Fee contract since 1996. 

The proposed SCCC, operating under an Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contract, will be able to work with the CCTN contractors to rapidly develop protocols and initiate clinical trials shortly after candidate products have completed the necessary preclinical testing.  The resultant IDIQ contract will consist of a one-year base period and six one-year option periods. The SCCC Contractor will provide necessary technical support needed by the NICHD and the CCTN sites, such as the development of research protocols, on-site monitoring of clinical trials, the statistical analysis of data from these trials, and the development of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications and initiation of New Drug Applications (NDA); and for a devices, Premarket notifications 510k, Premarket approvals (PMA), and Investigation Device Exemptions (IDE).

It is estimated that the new NICHD CCTN will consist of approximately 12 sites capable of performing female contraceptive clinical trials and approximately four sites capable of performing male contraceptive clinical trials.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC plans to issue a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) to SySense, Incorporated of Pomona, California for design and develop of an instrument for measuring drogue motion during aerial refueling maneuvers.  These services will be requested from the contractor through a "call order" type arrangement.  The contractor will be tasked to develop an instrument for measuring drogue dynamics on a tanker aircraft while a second aircraft attempts to link with the drogue.  The instrument must provide three (3) dimensional position measurements at high output rates. The size of the instrument must fit within the size restrictions of the drogue.  The goal is to develop an instrument system that autonomously measures drogue position for post-flight analysis.  The result of this requirement will be an instrument capable of measuring drogue dynamics.  The tests will verify the use of GPS receiver technology for this application.  A distributed GPS and processor scheme will be developed to store flight data.  This system may later be upgraded to link all of the GPS receivers together to improve measurement accuracy and acquisition time.  Finally, the system will capture at least 10 samples per second, which should be sufficient to characterize drogue dynamics. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/DFRC intends to procure these services directly from SySense, Incorporated on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  Due to proprietary nature of this design and development process, SySense, Incorporated is the only responsible source to provide these services.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:00 p.m. PST 13 Nov 2002.

1. The Project: NOAA is acquiring a U.S. purpose-built, U.S. flagged hydrographic vessel via a time-charter through Military Sealift Command. NOAA has a requirement for hydrographic surveying services to support nautical charting efforts aboard this vessel. A single contract will be awarded for one base year plus four option years in FY 2003 with performance commencing in late winter/early spring 2003. Under this contract the A-E firm will provide: 1) all survey equipment (with the exception of the shallow water multibeam sonar system), computers, and software necessary to navigate, perform data acquisition and processing, and manage the data on-board the vessel; 2) one person to supervise and manage the contractor's personnel and to serve as interface with the NOAA hydrographer-in-charge;3) about six   persons to operate the data acquisition suite of equipment (two operators on each of three watches); and 4) about three persons (one person on each of three watches) to perform initial processing of the data, including applying water level, vessel motion, and velocity of sound correctors to determine the true depths, correlating sonar targets, and perform quality control. The data acquisition suite shall consist of, but not limited to: 1) High speed, high-resolution digital side scan sonar (Klein K5500), 2) GPS aided inertial navigation system with RTK input for attitude/positioning (e.g. SeaPath 200), Sound speed profiling system (direct measure or conductivity / temperature / depth), 3) shallow water multibeam data acquisition software (e.g. Coastal Oceanographic HYPACK MAX), 4) GPS / RTK positioning system (e.g.  Trimble MS750), 5) Windows NT or Windows 2000 based sonar data processing hardware, 6) Sonar data processing software (e.g. CARIS HIPS / SIPS), 7) Minimum of five work stations, on a common LAN, for data processing with one of the five workstations available for use by Government personnel at all times, 8) Data management and protection solution (LTO tape / RAID5 drive arrays, NAS drive), 9) Bottom sampling equipment (grab sampler), and 10)     helmsman navigation display. The Government's vessel will be outfitted with one of the following multibeam systems:  Reson 8111, Simrad EM 1002, or SeaBeam 1050 D).

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC) Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) Program  Office, AAC/YH, plans to contract with Alliant TechSystems (ATK)  for the design of an electronic timer which replaces a mechanical timer in the fuze for the Tactical Munition Dispenser (TMD) section of the SFW system. The fuze is currently manufactured by ATK, and a previous Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP) 0026-E-0160 has been submitted which describes the detailed methodology that will be used to replace the mechanical timer.  The new electronic timer must be physically and functionally interchangeable with the current production fuze, improve performance by reducing timing tolerances, enhance producibility and testablility, and provide cost savings when compared with the present approach.  The new timer must operate from the system battery and cannot consume any power over and above the present combination of mechanical elements and electronic circuitry.  The new electronic assembly must interface with the current set of mechanical elements including piston actuators, explosive bolts, and detonators. The new circuitry must be laid out on the printed circuit board used in the current fuze section of the TMD.  The effort is to be accomplished in two phases. Phase 1 is a design and prototype hardware effort, and phase 2 (a contract option) is to be the qualification and implementation phase.  The scope of the design phase of the effort shall be the non-recurring development work required to update the previously submitted VECP fuze design to current electronic technology and to provide prototype hardware. Phase 2 will be the fabrication, prove out, and qualification of hardware effort.  The contractor shall identify tasks to be accomplished along with cost and schedule for each phase of the effort. The Contractor shall also provide estimated unit cost of the redesigned fuze.  It is anticipated that only one source, Alliant TechSystems, Janesville, WI, Developer of the fuze VECP can satisfy the minimum needs for this unique weapon system.  This contractual action is expected to be executed using ?Other than Full and Open Competition? procedures pursuant to FAR 6.032-1(a)(2)(ii).  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Direct all communications concerning this acquisition to Vicki Keider at (850) 882-3416, extension 3162.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTE:  THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CORRECT THE "SET ASIDE" FROM A "VERY SMALL BUSINESS" TO "N/A" FOR FULL CONSIDERATION BY ALL INTERESTED PARTIES.

REQUIREMENT:
General Services Administration is interested in a no cost assignable option to construct a  23,783 net rentable square feet, which will produce 20,681 BOMA usable square feet of office space.  This facility will be a build-to-suit to accommodate the Social Security Administration.

LEASE TERM: 10 years firm.

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
We are seeking improved sites of up to approximately 3.57 acres to include building set backs, required security set backs and required green spaces per the city of Austin.  Note:  New construction will require up to a 50-foot setback from any vehicular traffic including visitor or non-secured parking.  All utilities should be available to the site.  The Government will be leasing the facility; therefore proposing offerors should note this is a ?no cost assignable option? from the Government if the land is to be purchased by an offeror.  Ultimately, the office space must be contiguous and on one level without being split by a public corridor.  First floor space is required. Space must have the potential for efficient layout; columns must be at least 20 ft. apart center to center; space should not be ?U? or ?L? shaped or exceed a length to width ratio of 2:1.  The following space configurations will not be considered:  space with atriums or other areas interrupting contiguous space; extremely long or narrow runs of space; irregularly shaped space configurations or other unusual building features adversely affecting usage.  The site should be located in a professional office setting and not within close proximity to residential areas, railroad tracks, busy intersections or one-way access roads.  The site should not be located in close proximity to establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold or served, or where there are tenants related to drug treatment or detention facilities.  The site shall be on a city of Austin bus route, within 600 feet or within 2 blocks (whichever is less) from the proposed entrance.  If the site is not located with these parameters, offeror must provide a letter from the city of Austin?s mass transportation authority confirming a designated bus stop to be installed prior to completion of the facility.  The Government requires  a site that will accommodate 135 parking spaces which is part of the 3.57 acres, three (3) of which will be specifically for Government owned vehicles.  Parking shall be on site.  The facility must have the ability to accommodate approximately 20% growth over the term of the lease.  Normal hours of operation for the agency are 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and may or may not influence the traffic pattern in the area.  The proposed site must be successfully test fitted and be efficiently designed for the site.  The offeror shall provide a draft layout of the proposed facility on the site in a 1/4? ? 1/8? scale for review and evaluation by the GSA and using agency.  If the site is not efficient, the site will not be considered.

LOCATION:
Offered properties must be located in an area bounded by the streets shown below.  Offered properties which front the boundary line streets will be considered to be within the area of consideration.
	NORTH:	Research Boulevard (Hwy 183)
	EAST:		Cameron Road (Hwy 290) and I-35
	SOUTH:	Colorado River and Town Lake
	WEST:		Loop 1 

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
1)	Property address or specific cross street references
2)	Current plat of site offered
3)	Total number of acres offered
4)	Current approved zoning
5)	Available traffic pattern study
6)	Current Phase I or II - Environmental Study Assessment/ESA
7)	Geo technical/soil survey
8)	Any information regarding topography or other influences unique to the site that may affect the layout of the proposed building.

AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:
In no event shall the offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning the space to be leased with representatives of any Federal Agency other than the officers and employees of General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative.

<DESC>NA The Garrison Commander, Fort Myer, Virginia announced on 5 November 2002, its tentative decision to retain in-house the CIF/CER functions. This decision is the result of a competitive process conducted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Cir cular A-76. The decision to retain the performance of the functions in-house was made after a detailed study indicated it was more cost effective to continue to perform the functions by Government personnel rather than by contract. A thirty (30) day public  review period commences the start of business on Wednesday, 6 November 2002 and will continue through close of business Thursday, 5 December 2002. Documentation supporting the tentative decision is available for review at the Fort Myer Library, Building 4 69, Fort Myer, Virginia. Due to heightened security measures, interested parties should contact Ms. Pamela Walker at (703)696-0910 or Ms. Debra Bonds at (703)696-4166 to schedule review. Appeals of the decision should be mailed or delivered to the Capital District Contracting Center, Attn: Mr. William E. Campbell, Jr., Contracting Officer, 9410 Jackson Loop, Suite 101, Fort Belvoir VA 22060-5134.

All vendors and current contractors should be aware that the Evergreen Contracting option period extension can not be exercised if your electronic catalog has not been approved and posted on GSA Advantage!.  Contractors are now required to accept the Government purchase card for payments equal to or less than the micro-purchase threshold for oral and written delivery orders and you are encouraged to accept the Government purchase card for payment for orders above the threshold.

There is a contract sales criterion for all MAS contracts.  Clause I-FSS-639 entitled, ?Contract Sales Criteria?, states that a contract will not be awarded if the anticipated sales are not expected to exceed $25,000.  Resultant contracts will be canceled unless reported sales for each 12-month period from the date of award are not $25,000 or above.  This schedule period will be continuance, and will contain contracts with contract periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five (5) years (exclusion of any options) from the DOA.

PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE
for
Smithsonian Website/Multimedia Pro-Bono Development

1.	General.  The Smithsonian Institution was created by Act of the United States Congress in 1846 to carry out the terms of the Will of James Smithson who bequeathed the means to found a national institution based in Washington dedicated to  ?the increase and diffusion of knowledge . . . .?  The estate property was accepted by Congress which pledged the faith of the United States to a charitable trust for the benefit of the People of the United States.  The trust is administered by the Smithsonian Board of Regents, composed of the Chief Justice, the Vice President, three Members of the Senate, three Members of the House of Representatives, and nine citizens appointed by joint resolution of Congress.

2.	Background.  On April 30, 2002, the Smithsonian Office of Equal Employment and Minority Affairs (OEEMA) in conjunction with the Smithsonian Office of Contracting (OCon) conducted a Web/Multimedia Fair in which 68 web/multimedia vendors/producers participated.  At the Fair, Smithsonian staff were approached by multiple vendors requesting information about contracting opportunities for Smithsonian projects, whether paid or not.  In response to this unforeseen demand, Smithsonian program offices were invited to create a ?wish-list? of projects for which development and implementation were immediately desirable.  The result is attached separately to this notice for the review of any interested vendors (the ?Wish List?).

3.	Project Descriptions.  The Wish List is a synopsis, by Smithsonian museum/program office, of current needs for which there is no or insufficient money for development.  For all identified projects, we have estimated project size in accordance with the following scale: (A More Perfect Union <http://americanhistory.si.edu/perfectunion/experience/index.html> = small, Hirshhorn redesign <http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/> = medium, Explore the Universe <http://www.nasm.si.edu/galleries/gal111/universe/etu/index.html> = large), and, where relevant, the desired timeframe for completion. Initially created and posted on June 25, 2002, we intend to keep the Wish List up to date, adding newly identified needs and removing projects for which sufficient qualified and serious vendor response has been received as well as any for which a full commitment for programmatic support has lapsed.  Smithsonian reserves the right to rescind the Wish List in the event that insufficient response is generated on the identified projects.

4.	Minimum Requirements for Pre-Solicitation Response.  We can?t build it if you don?t come, therefore we invite interested and qualified vendors to identify those projects for which they would like to submit an offer.  To be responsive, submissions need merely identify your company, your URL, and any project(s) for which you desire the opportunity to develop on a pro bono basis. Please be sure to stipulate any restrictions which may apply to your level of interest (stating a hierarchy of preferred projects if, for example, you would care to submit a proposal for multiple ones but only enter into a contract to create a single one). This information will be collected and distributed to the originating program offices on a rolling basis, and for each project, as soon as a suitable bidlist has been established (e.g., at least 2-3 qualified candidates) we will contact the prospective offerors.  An indication of project interest by vendor(s) shall NEITHER obligate the vendor to submit a proposal to perform any work NOR obligate Smithsonian to invite proposals or issue contract(s) to have work performed.

5.	Responding to this Announcement:  Prospective offerors may ONLY submit information via e-mail to Bruce Falk, Office of Contracting at FalkB@si.edu.  Since it is presumed that relevant portfolios are viewable at the vendors? URL or obtainable upon request, no work samples are sought or required at this time. Offerors who submitted proposals in response to Smithsonian?s IDIQ RFP#F0236SOL0012 are permitted to make reference to any samples provided therein.  For these reasons, submissions greater than ONE SINGLE PAGE in length will be met with disdain.  (We are trying to make identification of desirable projects by interested firms as easy as possible; invited vendors will be given full opportunity to provide proposal(s) which address in detail specific project requirements.)

6.	Methodology for Competition.  Because these projects have little or no money attached to them, we will conduct the solicitation process in the following way.  First, the seriousness of vendor intent will be determined by follow-up contact prior to establishment of a bidlist, as bidlists will be kept small (preferring three offerors, but in no event more than five ? to the extent that more than five vendors express serious interest in a given project, we will make a determination as to which vendors to invite to submit a bid to ensure limited competition while minimizing vendor burden).  Second, identified, interested vendors will be provided with all criteria needed to draft a responsive proposal and invited to an initial discussion with the project team at least two weeks prior to the formal submission date.  Finally, Smithsonian shall evaluate the received proposals and intends to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal is evaluated to be responsive to project/solicitation requirements and the best from among all proposals received.  While specific criteria for any given project will be established and provided to preselected offerors prior to establishing a proposal due date, it is likely that credit recognition for any pro bono work awarded as a result of this announcement will be approximately equal to or greater than that currently offered by Smithsonian for its fully-budgeted development.

7.	Further Contact Info.  Please contact Bruce Falk immediately if you desire to receive a copy of the Wish List by e-mail, fax, or other format.  Vendors desiring clarification can submit questions either by phone (202) 275-1602, or in writing, by e-mail, or by fax at (202) 275-0624.  (We will make all reasonable effort to answer questions, but cannot guarantee response.)  Thank you for your attention to this pre-solicitation notice.  We look forward to hearing from you!

<DESC>Amendment:  This action, originally publicized in the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) dated 18 October 2002, is amended as follows:  a) Effort must be complete within 10 months of contract award to meet the Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) production schedule; b) The estimated contract cost for both phases is $2.1M; and c) A Technical Data Package for the fuze and timer assembly is available.

POSTED 10/18/2002:

The Air Armament Center (AAC) Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) Program  Office, AAC/YH, plans to contract with Alliant TechSystems (ATK)  for the design of an electronic timer which replaces a mechanical timer in the fuze for the Tactical Munition Dispenser (TMD) section of the SFW system. The fuze is currently manufactured by ATK, and a previous Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP) 0026-E-0160 has been submitted which describes the detailed methodology that will be used to replace the mechanical timer.  The new electronic timer must be physically and functionally interchangeable with the current production fuze, improve performance by reducing timing tolerances, enhance producibility and testablility, and provide cost savings when compared with the present approach.  The new timer must operate from the system battery and cannot consume any power over and above the present combination of mechanical elements and electronic circuitry.  The new electronic assembly must interface with the current set of mechanical elements including piston actuators, explosive bolts, and detonators. The new circuitry must be laid out on the printed circuit board used in the current fuze section of the TMD.  The effort is to be accomplished in two phases. Phase 1 is a design and prototype hardware effort, and phase 2 (a contract option) is to be the qualification and implementation phase.  The scope of the design phase of the effort shall be the non-recurring development work required to update the previously submitted VECP fuze design to current electronic technology and to provide prototype hardware. Phase 2 will be the fabrication, prove out, and qualification of hardware effort.  The contractor shall identify tasks to be accomplished along with cost and schedule for each phase of the effort. The Contractor shall also provide estimated unit cost of the redesigned fuze.  It is anticipated that only one source, Alliant TechSystems, Janesville, WI, Developer of the fuze VECP can satisfy the minimum needs for this unique weapon system.  This contractual action is expected to be executed using ?Other than Full and Open Competition? procedures pursuant to FAR 6.032-1(a)(2)(ii).  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Direct all communications concerning this acquisition to Vicki Keider at (850) 882-3416, extension 3162.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Medical/Surgical Commodity Business Unit is in the process of solicitation and award of a contract to a commercial Group Purchasing Organization (GPO). This contract will be an indefinite quantity type contract (IQC). It is anticipated that this contract will generate cost savings as well as improved standardization efforts.
 The contract will be awarded under full and open competition. The GPO will provide pricing at both the committed and uncommitted levels for product categories or groupings. The evaluation of calculated savings at both the committed and uncommitted levels will be the primary basis for the award decision.
 If and when a GPO is selected under this competitive procedure, a Tricare Region, an individual Military Treatment Facility (MTF), or a civilian customer may elect to make a commitment and gain access to favorable pricing to a product category in the GPO's portfolio without going through any further competitive process. Similarly, a Tricare Region, an MTF, or a civilian customer may use the uncommitted GPO price without going through any further competitive process. This is a change and a restructuring of how the DSCP customer medical community conducts business.
  Conversely, if a Tricare Region, MTF, or civilian customer does not choose to make a commitment to the GPO product category, or to buy at the uncommitted GPO price, the Tricare Region, MTF, or civilian customer may continue to buy the items as under the current system, but with the following three proposed changes to the DAPA rules:

   1) Large business DAPA's must offer national prices.
   2) Neither large nor small businesses can have pricing tiers on their DAPAs-unless the tiers result from a Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA).
   3) Small businesses may have DODAAC-restricted DAPA's (i.e.,small businesses are not limited to national DAPA prices).

  Either choosing the GPO's committed/uncommitted prices or following the current process will independently meet competition requirements.
  this summary notifies the DAPA holders of possible impending changes in the business practices of the Medical/Surgical Commodity Business Unit at DSCP. If you have any questions, please contact Joseph Wasko at tel:215-737-8398, or email: jwasko@dscp.dla.mil.

This notice serves as a sources sought notice /market survey for  informational/planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or pay for the information solicited.  The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC is seeking qualified  sources to provide supplies and services to plan, manage and execute  engineering, manufacturing and technical support tasks that will be necessary  for the execution of a possible contract beginning approximately July 2003.  Potential offeror’s shall have the capability to procure, fabricate, assemble,  inspect and deliver SDK hardware in accordance with a statement of work and the  Army’s Engineering Drawings, Quality Assurance Provisions (QAP), Special  Packaging Instructions (SPI), and Contract Data Requirements List, DD Form  1423.  This effort will include engineering tasks such as tolerance studies,  materials studies, managing the engineering drawings for the Government, and  the submission of Engineering Change Proposals, Requests for Deviation and  Requests for Waiver.  The SDK hardware to be procured by the ARMY consists of a combination of commercial off-the-shelf items, modified commercial off-the- shelf items, and SDK –unique fabricated items.  Items to be procured include  explosively formed penetrators (EFP), linear cavity charge containers, conical  cavity charge containers, magnets, telescoping support poles, tripods, elastic  cable, special mounting brackets, cable ties, priming adapters, special purpose  tape and graphic training aids.  There are additional SDK items currently being developed by the U.S. Army that will be procured at the end of the development phase.  It is the Army’s intent to procure these items in the future through  contract modifications.  These items consist of bar and cable cutters, multiple fragmenting EFPs, fence-piercing EFPs, pre-loaded EFPs, and two sizes of linear cavity charge containers.  The pre-loaded EFPs will constitute the first of a new category of SDK items that will require loading of explosives by the  contractor.  It is anticipated that the explosive for these EFPs will be PAX-2A  or some other explosive meeting Insensitive Munitions requirements.  The SDK  contains critical technology items (Distribution D), and only qualified DOD contractors and those contractors who can become qualified will be considered  in the proposed action.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United States Air Force Electronic System Center (ESC) to determine potential sources capable of providing and implementing the National Military Command Center (NMCC). Reference information can be found electronically on the Hanscom Electronic Resources Bulletin Board (HERBB) at www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil via searches on NMCC {see 1.CONOPS DEVELOPMENT GUIDE, 4. National Military Command Center, 5.NMCC TRD}. The government welcomes an opportunity to review information describing cost effective approaches even if the approach or specific details of an alternate approach differ from those captured on HERBB. The NMCC will provide for the collection, distribution, consolidation, evaluation, and assessment of local, national, and regional information to help users predict,  follow, and manage developing situations, and to; detect, declare, and manage crisis environments should they occur in eastern European nations. The NMCC program intent is to develop and implement a command center with capabilities satisfying requirements that arise in the context of predicting, planning, and exercising command and control of national resources in civil and military crisis situations. It will be a significant component used in conjunction with other essential parts of a national crisis management support system framework. The government's intention is to leverage the use of commercially available off-the-shelf software and hardware components (COTS) to the greatest extent. Interested parties are encouraged to reply identifying web sites and/or other company provided resources the Government can review to assess capability.  Interested parties should respond electronically to the email address vinita.veneziano-martin@hanscom.af.mil by 11-18-2002 to let the Government know of their interest.  Electronically submitted material sent in addition to a statement of interest should not exceed 14, one-sided, 8.5X11 inch pages, with the font no smaller than 10 point.  The Government would also be willing to meet with interested parties to discuss projected requirements and hear feedback from interested parties on 11-26-2002; if interested in arranging a meeting please contact Vinita Veneziano-Martin via email address vinita.veneziano-martin@hanscom.af.mil and an appointment will be scheduled. The purpose of this announcement is to help the government mitigate program costs, schedule, and performance risks, by identifying possibilities and potentially highly competitive firms for the NMCC acquisition. Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought request. Please communicate interest electronically to the email address vinita.veneziano-martin@hanscom.af.mil by 11-18-2002.

On Oct 22, 2001 the NTE amount was increased by $135 Million to $184.9 Million by ASN RDA, in accordance with FAR 6.302-2.  The basis for restricting competition was the proprietary information of Raytheon and  the duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirement through any other source.  This synopsis is issued to advertise requirements that will be met through orders placed under the BOA for a six month period.
