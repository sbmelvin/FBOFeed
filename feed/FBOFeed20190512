responsible contracting officer. However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel
Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek
resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest
with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is
suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC
protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed
within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program,
the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1(c)
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (OVERSEAS CONTRACTING ACTIVITIES)
<p>1.	GSO/Contracting Office recommends that U.S. Embassy Muscat, Department of State use other than full and open competition for the Acquisition/supply and installation of Screw Compressor for TRANE Chiller.  The estimated cost is $55,650.00 (21,420.00 Omani Rials).</p>
<p>2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>Replacement of the Compressor for one of the two Trane chillers that service the Chancery building.</p>
<p>3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's requirements and specifications.</p>
<p>The Chancery chillers are mission equipment.  The compressor must be a part that is authorized to be used with the Trane chiller and it must be installed by a Trane authorized technician who is authorized to work on air conditioning plant equipment of this capacity in Oman.  .</p>
<p>4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>The Embassy justifies its application to Far Sub Part 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>(c) Application for brand name descriptions. An acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited. It shall be justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304. The justification should indicate that the use of such descriptions in the acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. (Brand-name or equal descriptions and other purchase descriptions that permit prospective contractors to offer products other than those specifically referenced by brand name, provide for full and open competition and do not require justifications and approvals to support their use.)</p>
<p>5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited (for sole source acquisitions; also required for unusual and compelling urgency where more than one offer will not be solicited).</p>
<p>Chiller equipment is often proprietary and that is the case with TRANE Co.  Only TRANE Company trained and certified technicians can procure TRANE certified parts and satisfy warranty terms.</p>
<p>6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. The description should include whether a FedBizOpps notice was or will be publicized, as required by FAR 5.2, and if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies (e.g., blanket waiver provided in DOSAR 605.202-70).</p>
<p>No publicizing was done based on the market research that only one vender was available.</p>
<p>7.	A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>The vendor's price is a fair price based on past experience with similar work in Oman.</p>
<p>8.	A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.</p>
<p>FAC identified that this company is the only company with TRANE Company certified technicians and we validate this periodically.</p>
<p>9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>10.	A listing of sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>
<p>N/A.<br /> <br />CERTIFICATIONS</p>
<p>I certify that this justification is accurate and contains complete data necessary to support the recommendation for other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>________________________________<br />Date 						Name: Daniel C Pearson	<br /> Title: Facility Manager<br /> Requiring office</p>
<p>I certify that this submission is accurate, and that it contains complete information necessary to enable other officials to make an informed recommendation for approval or disapproval.</p>
