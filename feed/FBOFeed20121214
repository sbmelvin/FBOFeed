<DESC>Description: NSN 3040-01-214-3864 - CAM, BRAKE being bought in accordance with ALLISON TRANSMISSION, INC. (73342) P/N 23018110 Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. The required quantity is 544 each to be shipped to (SW3120) Anniston AL 36201-4199. FOB destination and inspection at destination is required. The delivery schedule is an incremental one and it is detailed in the solicitation. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 01/03/13. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance, socioeconomic, and Ability One. The required delivery is 60 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in US dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307

<DESC>This notice contains two announcements.  Announcement 1, The FAA intends to issue a 30 day contract extension under contract number DTFAWA-08-C-00103 to Zeta Associates of Fairfax, VA for senior systems engineering support for the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) Program.  The purpose of this extension is to allow for work to continue, until a new contract can be awarded.  The estimated value of the extension is $275,000.00.
Announcement 2, The FAA intends to issue a single source award to Zeta Associates of Fairfax, VA senior systems engineering support for the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) Program.  The anticipated period of performance including options is from February 1, 2013 through January 31, 2018.  The estimated total value inclusive of all options is $18,530,672.  
The authority for this single source procurement is provided by AMS Section 3.2.2.4.
The WAAS Program is a national mission-critical safety of life navigation system, so maintenance and performance upgrades must be executed such that operational availability, continuity, and integrity of performance are maintained.  The WAAS Program is currently planning for the next phase of the program.  
As the WAAS Program enters the next phase of the program, systems engineering expertise will be required. In particular, detailed knowledge of the WAAS architecture is required to support and maintain system integrity as changes to the system are made. Complexity of the WAAS architecture requires subject matter experts in GPS and GEO satellite signal processing.  Zeta personnel are integral to this effort, specifically in the assurance that no system modifications may result in a failure to meet stringent hazardously misleading information (HMI) requirements.  Prior to initial operating capability of WAAS, FAA had trouble certifying the WAAS integrity design.  Due to the stringent safety requirements imposed upon WAAS, verification of system integrity requirements can only be stated statistically and verified through analysis.  To accomplish this task, the WAAS Integrity Performance Panel was created, comprised of experts within the FAA, academia, and industry to perform this work.  From the onset, Zeta personnel have been designated as key members of this work and have continued to perform this work through the most recent analysis for Release 3B of the WAAS follow-on contract.  
Since 1997, Zeta Associates has provided systems engineering support to the FAA's WAAS product team on matters related to GPS system engineering and signal processing; GPS/WAAS G-II and G-III Receiver Development; GPS/WAAS antenna design; production and deployment of the integrity design for WAAS Code Noise Multi-path monitor; radio frequency interference; interference mitigation techniques; and development of signal generator subsystems. Due to the highly specialized nature of this requirement, a new awardee will need a lengthy transition period (months or years learning FAA Systems) prior to performing the required support.  Therefore, awarding this requirement to a vendor other than Zeta would cause a significant delay in completing the next Phase of the WAAS Program.  For the reasons stated above, it is in the Government's best interest to award this requirement to Zeta Associates.
A competitive solicitation is not available for these procurement.  Questions concerning this procurement must be submitted by email to Dwayne.Berry@faa.gov by no later than January 7, 2013.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Assistant Administrator of Human Resources,  Office of Benefits and Worklife (AHP-400) has the mission of advising and supporting the management of the Federal Aviation Administration in regard to programs which enhance the lives of the FAA's workforce. This announcement's scope of work is the administration of the FAA's child care subsidy program.  Federal legislation which Congress enacted through Public Law 107-67, Sec. 630, on November 12, 2001, permits Federal agencies to administer a program to assist their lower income Federal employees with the costs of childcare.  A child care subsidy program helps to offset the high costs of childcare.  The program increases the FAA's ability to retain a qualified workforce by lowering the cost of child care, allowing parents to stay engaged with the workplace.  The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capability from sources that can provide administrative services to the FAA.  Responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  The FAA is soliciting this information from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified business capable of providing this service.  The information received will be used to finalize the FAA's acquisition strategy for the requirement.  Duties include: handling administrative tasks associated with the child care subsidy program, providing agency employees with applications to the child care subsidy program, processing those applications, notifications of eligibility to applicants, ensuring that child care providers are licensed and/or regulated and processing weekly invoices from and payment to participating child care providers.  The current provider processes invoices from and payments to approximately 140 childcare facilities.  See Attachment 1 for Draft Statement of Work for more details on the work to be performed. This market survey is also being conducted to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition to be among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified businesses. The planned period of performance for this effort is five years from date of award.  The award structure will include a 12-month base period with four 12-month option periods.

The acquisition of this agreement includes trained service engineers, spare parts inventory, maintenance manuals, access to other working instruments and years of experience with this instrument.    The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing via email to stacy.g.houston@nasa.gov not later than COB local time on December 26, 2012. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Portland VA Medical Center is seeking a contractor to provide GC/MS fatty acid analysis.  Services will include the gas chromatography/ mass spectroscopy analyses of ~800 red blood cell (RBC) blood samples in order to meet specific aim #3 of Dr. Shannon's VACO-funded Genetic Susceptibility, Environment and Prostate Cancer Risk study.  Determine fatty acid concentrations in ~800 RBC blood samples via the use of gas chromatography/ mass spectroscopy.  The Government requires the delivery of results and interpretation of said results via email.
Specifically, the following was proposed for the fatty acid analyses process: one hundred ul of red cells shall be mixed with 250ul of a Reagent1(methanol and KOH) in a GC vial and vortexed.  Then 250ul of a Reagent2(Hexane) is added to the vial and similarly vortexed. Lastly, 250ul of a Reagent3(dyed and diluted 12N HCl) is added before transferring 50ul of the organic layer to an insert for GC analysis.

The FAME extract shall be injected in a split mode (1:30) and will be separated on a Hewlett-Packard, Model 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE).  The GC system is equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), electronic pressure control (EPC), ChemStation software (Agilent), and automatic sampler (HP7673).  FAME shall be separated on a 25m by 0.20mm i.d. capillary column (Agilent J&W19091B-102 Ultra 2) with 0.33um coating.  The carrier gas is hydrogen at 60 PSI and make-up gas is nitrogen at 60 PSI at the tank.  The injector and the detector port temperatures are set at 250oC and 300oC, respectively. The initial oven temperature is 190oC and then the oven temperature will be increased to 285oC at 10o/min for an approximate 9 minute run.  Finally, the oven temperature will be raised at 60o/minutes to 310o and held for 1 minute.
Contractor shall NOT have access to patient records or identifiers.  No background investigation is required.  All blood specimens shall be labeled with the study identification (code) number.  All blood specimens shall be sent via overnight tracked delivery by the investigator's staff.  No employee of the contractor will require access to Dr. Shannon's -80' freezer (in which our specimens are stored) or to Portland VA secure network drive (where we retain the link to study identifiers).   This solicitation is set-aside 100% for small business.  Bids will be due back on or about 12/28/2012.

This is only an estimate and will not bind the contractor or the Government in any way or at any time into a contract with any of the specified terms below. <br> This is a market survey to locate potential sources of supply for manufacturing of AN/AVS-7 (10)B with NSN: 5895-01-577-5425, HUD assemblies and subassemblies ( flat panel, NSN: 5895-01-5893636, NSN: 5895-01-5893636). The HUD facilitates helicopter pilots to use the Aviator's Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) goggles during flight operations. The HUD supplies critical operational information to the pilot superimposed over the ANVIS image. The HUD diminishes the requirement for the pilot and co-pilot to look at the flight instruments, thus allowing them to concentrate on scanning outside of the cockpit. <br> The U.S. Army is seeking to identify vendors with the capability to supply an indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract over a two year period. The vendors must have extensive knowledge of the ANVIS HUD system and also be able to provide at least thirty (30) ISDC per month.  The U.S. Army will not provide any test equipment or facilities for this effort. <br>  <br> Any interested sources must send the following information, NLT 28 December 2012, to CECOM LCMC PRD Directorate, ATTN: RDER-PRA-CA (Michelet Audige), Bldg 6007, APG, MD 21005 or email to Michelet.audige.civ@mail.mil: <br>  	Identification of the contractor as a Large or Small business.

<DESC>This is a acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, and management capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for repairing the Brock Inlet Canal Station 4 + 1.42 and proceeding in a westerly direction and ending at the reservoir inlet structure at the Brock Inlet Canal Station 354 + 75.51 located in Imperial County, CA roughly  mile West of Gordon's Well Interstate 8 (I-8) (Exit 151) interchange to just West of the Brock Research Center I-8 (Exit 146) interchange.    
Reclamation has completed a project that constructed an 8,000 acre-foot storage reservoir near Drop 2 on the All-American Canal in Imperial County in Southern California.
The recently completed reservoir will store Colorado River water that has been released from Parker Dam to meet downstream water orders but cannot be delivered for various reasons, such as changed weather conditions or other factors.  This water has typically not been put to beneficial use within the United States due to lack of sufficient storage capacity below Parker Dam.
During an inspection conducted on the above referenced facility, it was noted that there appeared to be thermal expansion in the inlet canal concrete lining due to due to the very large temperature variations that are typical for the southwest desert.  It was originally noted that the expansion joint sealant and in certain instances the sponge rubber joint sealant were being pushed out of the joints.
A second inspection of the inlet canal was conducted in conjunction with an outage in the system for maintenance work on the reservoir and associated structures.  During the second inspection, the engineers identified and inspected 76 existing expansion joints.  The existing expansion joints were spaced at varying intervals from 100 to 500 plus feet and contraction joints with water stop spaced at 14' between the individual expansion joints.  It was noted during the inspection that thermal movement to a varying degree has occurred in all of the existing expansion joints.  In some cases, the joints have completely closed up.  The original expansion joints were 1" wide filled with sponge rubber backer and non-sag joint sealant.  It has been conservatively estimated that the existing joints have moved anywhere from 5/8" to 1", in some cases totally closing the joints and extruding out the sealant and in some instances the sponge rubber expansion joint filler material.  In a number of locations, the existing concrete panel is actually riding up over the adjacent panel.
The principal components of work to be performed include the following:
1.  Install a temporary seepage control dike in the inlet channel to control water seepage through the gates.  Monitor and control nuisance water during construction.
2.  Saw cut 68 new, 1" wide expansion joints in the Brock Reservoir concrete lined inlet canal (canal is 16.5 feet deep, 18.5 feet bottom width and 2:1 side slopes).
3.  Re-establish 76 of the designated existing expansion joints back to being 1" wide by saw cutting. 
4.  Furnishing and installing 1" wide sponge rubber expansion joint material.
5.  Preparing the joint surface and furnishing and installing a non-sag elastomeric joint sealant. . 6.  Additional work may require the saw cutting and removal of designated portions of the lining to re-establish the existing expansion joint, the fine grading and compacting of earth materials, and the placing of concrete for patching the removed concrete.
The proposed contract will be a firm-fixed price Construction contract with an estimated performance period of 90 calendar days.  The estimated total contract value is between $500,000.00 - $1,000,000.00.  
This acquisition, when announced, will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction with a corresponding small business size standard of $33.5M.
Capability statements are to be submitted no later than December 21, 2012.  The capabilities package submitted by a vendor should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and responsibility to perform the principal components of work listed above.  Packages should include the following information:  (1) Business name, address, business size and type, (8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc.), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number; (2) Demonstration of the firm's experience shown by providing a list of actual jobs completed within the past five years in which your firm completed work in saw cutting and installing and sealing expansion joints.  Additionally, for each job listed provide the following: a brief description of the work performed, project title, dollar value of the job, the company name, location, and the customer's contact name and phone number for the work completed.  Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length.
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Jacqueline Carrera, YAO-3100, 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, AZ  85364; or via e-mail to jcarrera@usbr.gov.
When it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a pre-solicitation notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) Upper Stage Service Launch Services Program, Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, NASA General Information: Reference Number:		RFI-KSC-USS Posted Date:			December 14, 2012 Original Response Date: February 12, 2013 Classification Code:		V126 NAICS Code:			336414 				 INTRODUCTION The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Launch Service Program (LSP) invites you to submit a response to this inquiry to assist in the development of an approach to provide the Agency with an upper stage service. LSP serves as the Agency's provider of domestic expendable launch services and advisor on expendable launch systems. LSP oversees mission integration, mission analysis, launch vehicle production, and down range telemetry assets at various domestic and international locations. The program manages launch site activities at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) and Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB). The primary purpose of this RFI is to collect information on key parameters that will help NASA refine and mature an acquisition strategy for procuring an independent upper stage service. The service may include the upper stage hardware, support of mission integration efforts, meetings, reviews, analyses, ground support equipment, launch site integration, processing, testing, operations and launch support. The intent is to provide a cost effective and reliable upper stage that enhances performance for high energy NASA missions to be flown on launch vehicles procured through the NASA Launch Services (NLS) II Contract. BACKGROUND LSP provides domestic launch services for NASA payloads including high energy Earth escape missions, many of which may benefit from the use of an upper stage. The intended use of an upper stage is to enable additional performance options for NASA missions that utilize the NLS II fleet of Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV). Historically, high energy planetary missions that require performance beyond a launch vehicles contracted capability have individually acquired and integrated an upper stage separate from the launch service. This one-off approach complicates mission design and limits synergy with other programs. An upper stage service would better support the science mission community by providing a known and common capability available for use on multiple NLS II launch vehicles. NASA is interested in utilizing a complete and independent upper stage that is compatible with existing launch vehicles using an industry standard set of payload adapters and electrical connectors. Of primary interest is a stage that provides an approximate delta-V capability of 3,000 m/sec (~10,000 ft/sec) given a payload of 500 kg (1100 lbs) and is able to support a payload range of approximately 400 to 3800 kg (880 to 8400 lbs). Both larger and smaller systems are of interest as well. For the purpose of assessing NASA missions that may benefit from the use of an upper stage, NASA is considering a mission model with the potential for a Mars mission every two years along with an additional science mission every three to five years beginning in the 2017 time frame. SPECIFIC INFORMATION SOLICITED The objective of this RFI is to solicit information from industry that could potentially enhance NASAs approach for acquisition of an upper stage service that may be utilized by selected NASA missions. Responders are invited to provide information regarding the topics discussed below. Describe the overall upper stage concept including propulsion method, system heritage, and generalized processing and launch environments (allowable and payload induced). Provide estimated stage performance capability using any method of choice (e.g. delta-v as a function of payload mass, spacecraft (S/C) mass as a function of C3 assuming the use of a proposed upper stage on various launch vehicles (LV) already available to NASA under the NLS II contract). Of particular interest is performance capability for the sample missions provided below: Mission LV	      C3(km2/sec2) DLA(deg)  S/C Mass Goal (kg) 1		Atlas V 551	159	    &lt;=28.5	610 2		Falcon 9	19	    &lt;=28.5	2300 3		Falcon 9	9	    &lt;=28.5	3800 More information on the NLS II launch vehicle fleet including vehicle performance can be found at http://elvperf.ksc.nasa.gov/  .  Note that the NLS II launch vehicle performance provided on this web site reflects separated payload mass assuming a standard payload adapter and separation system. For the purposes of this RFI, add 50 kg to the reported NLS II launch vehicle performance capability if the upper stage will attach to the launch vehicle via a 62 inch bolted interface (see below). Discuss electrical/mechanical interfaces including payload attach fittings with consideration being given to the upper stage to launch vehicle interface and the upper stage to spacecraft interface. Consideration should also be given to spacecraft separation system options, including separation indication signals. Provide overall stage dimensions to demonstrate compatibility with existing payload envelopes for vehicles on the NLS II contract. Upper stage designs are expected to interface with NLS II launch vehicles via either a 62 inch diameter bolted adapter (if the launch vehicle/upper stage separation system is provided by the upper stage) or any of the various industry standard attach fitting/separation system options provided as part of the NLS II launch service. Industry standard 37 to 61 pin electrical connectors should be assumed. Any launch-vehicle-to-upper-stage data requirements, to be incorporated into the electrical interface with the launch vehicle, should be identified. More information can be found in the launch vehicle user guides. Atlas V: http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/pages/Products_AtlasV.shtml Falcon 9: http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php Discuss the approach to upper stage guidance navigation and control including the method used to achieve an accurate injection state. Consideration should be given to requirements at upper stage separation, during upper stage burn, and at spacecraft separation. Discuss vehicle sequencing from upper stage separation through spacecraft separation. Also briefly describe the avionics system, telemetry system and any spin rate capability. Discuss the ability to support mission integration efforts as part of an upper stage service. Efforts required may include but are not limited to support of technical interchange meetings, requirements definition, mission design reviews, delivery of analysis products, standalone and integrated operations including stage testing, hazardous processing, concept of operations for spacecraft and launch vehicle processing, and launch campaign. Emphasis should be placed on minimizing launch pad operations. Discuss the upper stage development effort and current level of overall system maturity. Address the ability and approach to support mission integration activities after mission award, while completing stage development and/or qualification in parallel. Identify any planned uses of the proposed upper stage concept prior to a potential mission award. Discuss or suggest any terms and conditions for alternative contractual approaches to procure an upper stage capability (e.g. Teaming with existing NLS II launch service providers). Provide expected ROM costs and the associated phasing of the payment of these costs as related to the development, initial and follow-on use of an upper stage. Phasing of development, initial, and follow-on use should be provided in the form of a payment schedule tied to upper stage integration milestones in preparation for launch.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice and is for market research purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION OR BID. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District is seeking information regarding capability and availability of potential small business contractors to perform geophysical testing. <br>  <br> The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to determine the availability of qualified contractors to perform these services to include Certified Small Businesses, HUBZone Certified Small Business Concerns, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Women-Owned Businesses. <br>  <br> The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 541360. The Small Business Size Standard is $14,000,000. Offerors are requested to respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis.  <br>  <br> Responses are requested only from: POTENTIAL SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTORS that have the knowledge, skills and capability to perform the work concerning the potential project described below. <br>  <br> Responses are to be sent via email to david.w.neal@usace.army.mil no later than 4:00 p.m. Central Time, 21 December 2012. <br>  <br> Scope of Work: <br>  <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers Omaha District is currently performing an erodibility study for the spillway feature of Pipestem Dam (see Figure 1). Pipestem Dam is located northwest of the city of Jamestown, North Dakota. The area currently being considered is slightly over 100 acres in size and is shown in Figure 1 by the highlighted flat area southwest of the embankment. The boundary of the geophysical investigations shall extend to a minimum of 100 feet beyond the limits of the spillway floor.  <br>  <br> The Contractor shall perform geophysical testing in support of site characterization efforts to meet the following project objectives:  1) Define the depth to bedrock across the study area, 2) Provide gross lithologic data regarding the overburden materials, and 3) Provide detailed lithologic data of the upper 60 feet of unconsolidated materials. The depth of investigations for objectives 1 and 2 above shall be approximately 150 feet below ground surface for estimating purposes. Data density shall be sufficient to provide a 3-dimensional portrayal of the top of bedrock. These objectives may be achieved by collecting time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) data.  The total line length is 23,000 feet for estimating purposes. The Contractor may adjust this estimated footage; however, all changes must come with justification for increasing or decreasing the total footage required to meet the project objectives. The number of transects required to meet the objectives outlined above shall be proposed by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall acquire the TDEM data to map lateral and vertical variations in the ground conductivity.  Along line station spacing shall not exceed 2 meters in order to provide a continuous profile of the subsurface conductivity variability.  TDEM data should be coupled with sub-meter accuracy GPS to aid in follow-up investigations. <br>  <br> The geophysical system used for collecting the time-domain data must be a mobile system. In addition, since very near surface data is being collected, the geophysical receiver, when combined with the appropriate transmitter, must be capable of remote control operation, high-speed data transfer, and capable of very short turnoff times (1.5 microsecond shutoff into a 3- to 5-meter loop) in order to provide higher resolution imaging. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall obtain all necessary permits, licenses, and approvals from all local, state, and federal authorities as are necessary for the performance of the Contractor's services.  The Government will obtain any required access agreements with property owners, their representative, or agent, on properties not controlled by the Government. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall prepare all necessary planning documents to include, at a minimum, an abbreviated site-specific draft and final Work Plan and Site Safety and Health Plan.  As appropriate, the Work Plan shall include the results of any forward modeling performed to help interpret the production data or to constrain those earth models derived from the production survey data. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall prepare a draft and final report.  Drawings and sketches shall be prepared as required to present details and results of the investigation.  The scale and quality of the drawings shall be appropriate for the purpose intended. <br>  <br> Please include the following information in your response/narrative:  <br>   Company name, address, and point of contact, with (h)er/is phone number and email address <br>   Duns number and CAGE Code for your company <br>   Offeror's business size to include designation as Certified Small Businesses, HUBZone Certified Small Business Concerns, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses and Women Owned Small Businesses <br>   Offeror's capability to perform, to include geographic span, logistic complexity, and project size  <br>   Details of similar projects and state whether you were the Prime or subcontractor <br>   Project references (including owner with phone number and email address) <br>  <br> Comments will be shared with the Government and the project management team, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence. <br>  <br>  <br>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  It is neither a solicitation announcement nor a request for proposals or quotes and shall not obligate the Government to award a contract.  The purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is for market research to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources interested and capable of performing the work and obtain their size classification relative to the North American Classification System (NACIS) Code 333314 with a size standard of 500 employees.  

SAO East is seeking sources of Micron III Retinal Imaging Systems, or a brand name or equal system that is compatible with the salient characteristics listed below.  

Research requirements: 

1. Micron III (1 each)
Studies are conducted using mice and rats as analogues for human diseases. In particular for the eye these studies examine retinal function, retinal disease, treatments, toxicity, and genetics. Such studies have been severely hampered by a robust ability to image the retinas in these animals. Such imaging is challenging because of the tiny size of the mouse eye, 3 mm, and the general difficulty of injecting light into the eye. Further, critical studies are dependent on the use of fluoresciene angiography and fluorescent molecules injected into the animal. 

SALIENT CHARECTERISTICS: 

A camera is required that can: Enable longitudinal studies, that is, enable the study of a single specimen over time, and provide bright field, fluroscience and Evan's Blue angiography, and fluorescent studies of arbitrary fluoropores across the visible spectrum. 
Technical performance parameters include: 
Real time digital video recording uncompressed with 24 bit resolution 
Ability to convert stored videos to AVI files 
Ability to export still frames into BMP, PNG, TIFF and JPEG formats 
Real time display to enable focusing and alignment 
Ability to insert arbitrary filter pairs for fluorescent imaging 
Ability to image both the rat and the mouse 
The system must be easy to use and include a goniostage for alignment of the animal 
The physical size must be such that it can fit onto the laboratory bench without using more than 1.5 meters of linear space. 
A system is required for which additional imaging and research modalities can be added such as anterior segment imaging, OCT, ERG, and laser photocoagulation 
It is also required that this camera be validated by current use in at least fifty major university centers. 

2. Optical Coherence Topographer (1 each)
Studies are conducted using mice and rats as analogues for human diseases. In particular for the eye these studies examine retinal function, retinal disease, treatments, toxicity, and genetics. Such studies have been severely hampered by a robust ability to obtain measurements of the retinal layers by a technique called optical coherence tomography. Such imaging is widely used for clinical work with humans; however, adopting these devices to animal work poses many challenges. Some systems have been adopted but they are physically large, the required space includes large carts in addition to laboratory bench space, and they must bear the cost burden associated with clinically approved devices. In the end, they are not optimized for imaging of the tiny mouse eye. More critically, they do not simultaneously obtain bright field images of the retina to guide the OCT scan to lie precisely across small but very important retinal feature. 
SALIENT CHARECTERISTICS: 

Technical performance parameters include: 
The optics have been specifically designed for the rodent eye 
The resolution is 2 microns 
Scans can be acquired in 2D and 3D 
The scan is guided from the bright field image so that it can be precisely guided over small lesions 
Image averaging will be robust with the eye stabilized to avoid averaging of images with motion artifacts 
The system will be compact not requiring any additional laboratory bench space over what is already required for a rodent retinal imaging microscope 
The system must record real time scans and the bright field image with the guide beam for documentation of the location of the OCT scan 

3. Slit lamp imager for rodent eyes (1 each)
Studies are conducted using mice and rats as analogues for human diseases. These studies include the anterior segment and in particular the cornea and the eye lens. Traditionally, anterior segment imaging in clinical practice is imaged using a device called a slit lamp. This actually is a low power microscope and a lamp to illuminate the anterior segment with a thin slit of light. This can allow the clinician to see the layers in the eye by projection of this slit diagonally to the eye. The slit width and height are adjustable and the color can be changed for use of topical fluorescein. These devices are built primarily for visualization and for imaging and documentation various ad hoc add-on cameras are used. And, the human slit lamp has its own very large stand, an unacceptable device in a crowded research laboratory. 
SALIENT CHARECTERISTICS: 

The device must be sized and scaled for the rodent eye, be optimized for imaging not visualization, and provide a field of view and resolution suitable for the 3 mm mouse eye and 6 mm rat eye. 

Technical performance parameters include: 
Field of view of 4 mm and with 4 microns resolution
A slit of variable width up to 4 mm and down to zero width
A variable height from 4 mm down to 1 mm
White light and cobalt blue for topical fluorescein
Extensive mechanisms to adjust the physical location and angle of the eye to the beams
Two back fill lights, a requirement for imaging systems
The system must be mounted on the retinal imaging system and not require additional laboratory space.

4. A laser injector (1 each)

SALIENT CHARECTERISTICS: 

Laser photo coagulation is extremely difficult and requires a great deal of skill. When this technique is applied to mice and rats, the skill level requirement is greatly increased. The perspective is that for example the retinal area of the mouse eye seen in a single view has the transverse width of the human optical disk. Even a skill ophthalmologist finds it difficult to produce reliable laser energy injections. What is needed is a system that is sufficiently, easy to use so that laboratory technicians can deliver reliable photo coagulations. To this end the system must: 

Technical performance parameters include: 
Provide a real time image of the area of the eye where the laser energy is to be applied.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Synopsis:</span></strong>
<p>This notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No Solicitation is available at this time.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to invite interested parties to attend an Industry Day concerning the requirement described below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope:<br /></span></strong><br />NIST requires the construction of the B1R Phase II in order to renovate Building 1, Wing 3 to reinstate it as a state-of-the-art research facility for the performance of highly sophisticated research. The proposed B1R Phase II is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of United States (US) industrial competitiveness in the world market.</p>
<p>The B1R Phase II consists of an interior upgrade and an expansion of Wing 3. The primary objective is constructing Level 3 (L3) capable lab space that will be flexible enough to serve as a swing space throughout the next phases of construction throughout Building 1. There will also be enclosed offices, open offices, interaction spaces and service galleys.</p>
<p>The B1R Phase II will allow the laboratory to combine the features of close temperature control, vibration isolation, air cleanliness and demanding power quality into a facility of crucial national importance. The B1R Phase II will consist of general purpose instrument laboratories. Temperature control will be achieved down to +/- 0.5 degree C in some areas, humidity control to +/- 5% and air filtration to class 10,000.</p>
<p>The B1R Phase II area is approximately 32,000 square feet. Environmental and space requirements for the building are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST's most technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness. The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1R Phase II can be economically met with renovated laboratory space; therefore, the B1R Phase II is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market.</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516.  The U.S Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Thermo Fisher Scientific (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.- a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific), 3747 N Meridian Road, Rockford, IL 61101 for purchase and installation of a LED light source for the Cellomics ArrayScan V imager and technology upgrade. This specialized equipment is used in a core research laboratory for high throughput imaging. Thermo Fisher Scientific is the only vendor with knowledge of the proprietary hardware and software associated with the Cellomics imaging equipment being upgraded. Since Thermo Fisher is the only manufacturer and distributor of the LED light source contained in this instrument, as well as the only distributor of the software which runs the equipment, EPA believes this is the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirement for this particular hardware and software upgrade.  The circumstance permitting "soliciting from a single source" at this time is FAR 13.106-1(2)(b).  The anticipated delivery period is 4 to 6 weeks after placement of the order.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required hardware and software installation and upgrade should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Robin S. Harris (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC 27703 or email to harris.robin@epa.gov.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar manufacturing of blankets, comforters, sweatshirts, sweatpants or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, identify the work the subcontractor will be performing if you are relying on the subcontractor's past performance.</p>
<p>c. Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent.

Contracts older than three years will not be considered. Furnish the following information for each reference:</p>
<p>(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Services provided<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified up-to-date name, address, email address, FAX and telephone number(s) for each company Point of Contact.<br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>

<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i. Price<br />ii. Past Performance</p>
<p>Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (JAN 99).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and representations and certifications, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors will be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. This award will result in a Firm-fixed price purchase order and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>a. Price Evaluation. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>b. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving manufacturing of blankets, comforters, sweatshirts, sweatpants or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receives a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.</p>
<p>c. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>d. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>e. A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners will be made. In determining relevance for individual contract, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevance will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevance. The following relevancy definitions are:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar manufacturing of blankets, comforters, sweatshirts, sweatpants or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar manufacturing of blankets, comforters, sweatpants, sweatshirts or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>f. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>g. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>i. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>

While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition.

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong>
<p>This solicitation is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016 to provide for competitive selection of research proposals. A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will not be issued. Contracts based upon the responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and are in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369 "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984." Awards issued under this BAA are planned in Fiscal Year (FY) 2013. No contract awards or other instruments that obligate funds will be made until appropriated funds are available from which payment for contract purposes can be made.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY:</strong></p>
<p>The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) states that DHS S&amp;T will "support basic and applied homeland security research to promote revolutionary changes in technologies; advance the development, testing and evaluation, and deployment of critical homeland security technologies; and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that would address homeland security vulnerabilities." Pursuant to this mission, the Chemical and Biological Defense Division (CBD) seeks technologies to prevent and defend against a chemical and biological attack. Within the CBD is the Threat Characterization and Attribution (TCA) Branch, which has the mission to conduct threat and risk assessments on both traditional and advanced agents; characterize biological threats, provide scientific support to the biodefense, chemical defense and intelligence communities.</p>
<p>The Biological Threat Characterization Program (BTCP) supports the TCA Branch within CBD of DHS S&amp;T. The BTCP has been established to characterize biological threats to support the four pillars of biodefense as outlined in HSPD-10: Threat Awareness, Prevention and Protection, Surveillance and Detection, and Response and Recovery. The Biological Threat characterization's goal is to improve the understanding of the impact of a biological attack on the country in order to enhance national preparedness.</p>
<p>Biological threat information requirements are identified and prioritized from internal DHS sources and other Federal government partners. This BAA seeks to conducts studies and laboratory experimentation to address information requirements in biological threat characterization. The measures of success are determined by the positive influence that the deliverables have on biological agent threat awareness, prevention of and protection from a biological agent incident, surveillance and detection during a biological incident, and response and recovery from a biological incident.</p>
<p><strong><em>DHS Biological Threat Characterization Program (BTCP) Mission</em></strong></p>
<p>The mission of BTCP is to characterize biological threats to support the four pillars of biodefense as outlined in the President's Biodefense Strategy for the 21st Century, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) - 10: threat awareness, prevention and protection, surveillance and detection, and response and recovery. The BTCP develops and provides knowledge reports and tools that address information requirements in biological threat characterization to better understand the risk uncertainty of current and future biological threats and to determine potential impacts to guide the prioritized development of countermeasures such as detectors, drugs, vaccines, and decontamination technologies.</p>
<p>There is a wide diversity of bacteria, fungi, viruses, toxins, and biomolecules known to cause human disease. Given the diversity and disease potential, a rational first approach is to rank order-known biological agents according to perceived risk and begin threat characterization by addressing the highest risk agents first. However, given the ever-expanding list of customized agents of potential concern, it is not feasible to develop medical countermeasures for every known pathogen and toxin. Instead, broader strategies are needed to address (i.e., characterize, assess, prioritize, and counter) multiple pathogens and toxins for less than the cost of a single bioagent scenario. Characteristics common to many potential Biological Threat event scenarios must be addressed as a class, mechanism, or parameter while maintaining the scientific and other factors that support evaluating biodefense options including likelihood, consequence or risk.<br /><br /><em>Priority Traditional Agents</em> - Traditional microbial agents occur naturally and can have a major impact on public health during natural outbreaks (e.g., E. coli 0157 in tomatoes) or if used nefariously to intentionally cause harm. Examples include Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and other microbial agents, and toxins such as those identified in the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agent lists. The scientific community is making progress in understanding basic pathogen biology, environmental microbiology, host immunity, and model systems that contribute to an integrated systems-level assessment of traditional Biological Threats. The BTCP focus is risk-driving parameters of the agents, potential scenarios, and countermeasures. Defining parameters and mechanisms for a systems representation will enable better characterization of key contributions to risk. In addition, knowing these parameters allows the use of calibrated surrogates and simulants when direct evaluation with the agent cannot or should not be performed (e.g., safety, ethics, unculturable). The integrated traditional agent framework is the foundation and partial validation for assessments of risks from advanced threats. <br /><br /><em>Endemic, Re-emerging, and Newly Emerging Disease Assessment</em>--Outbreaks of naturally-occurring infectious diseases are here-and-now priorities that also provide data to calibrate the systems biology approach being developed using traditional agents. These pathogens and the diseases they cause will act as an important test platform for our integrated risk and evaluation systems and threat archetypes. This will both inform our systems development and maintain and expand our collaboration with and support to the public health community. <br /><br /><em>Advanced-threat Assessment</em>--The systems biology framework including threat archetypes developed for traditional agents, validated with data from endemic, re-emerging, and newly emerging diseases, extrapolated using parameters developed with surrogates and simulants when needed, and extended with the most up-to-date science and best predictions of technology trends, provides a robust assessment of potential advanced threat scenarios. The BTCP has made initial investments in these areas including evaluation of characteristics of traditional agents to improve assessments of advanced threats. In the future, this approach and knowledge-base facilitates proactive characterization and more rapid response.<br /><br /><strong><em>DHS Biological Threat Characteristic Program Objectives</em></strong></p>
<p>The objective of biological threat characterization is to improve understanding of the impact of a biological attack on the country to enhance national preparedness. This is accomplished by providing technical intelligence on identified knowledge gaps relating to biological agents and tools that address information requirements in biological threat characterization to better understand the risk uncertainty of current and future biological threats and to determine potential impacts to guide the prioritized development of countermeasures such as detectors, drugs, vaccines, and decontamination technologies.<br /><br /><strong><em>Description of Technical Focus Areas (TFAs)</em></strong></p>
<p>The focus of this BAA is in the area of Biological Threat characteristics, specifically:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-1</span>:</strong> Studies to understand Agent Production Rates and Storage Stability/decay rates. (At the current time BTCC is working on the High consequence Bio-threat agents and this BAA may be used for the solicitation of information in order to support information gathering for other agents to inform Risk Assessments).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-2</span></strong>: Studies to understand incubation time for disease onset after exposure using the best animal models. (Once again, the Government may use this BAA in order to solicit information of agents not currently focused by BTCC to better inform Risk Analysis).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-3</span>:</strong> Studies to understand morbidity and mortality rates using the best animal models by gathering useful and credible human data to better inform Risk Analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-4</span>:</strong> Studies to better understand ID50 and LD50 for non high consequence pathogens using the best animal models or by gathering credible and useful human data to better inform Risk Analysis</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-5</span>:</strong> Studies examining rational approaches to biological agent characterization given the ever-expanding list of agents of concern and shifting landscape in biotechnology.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. technical specifications, etc.) may be requested, pricing shall be entered in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the awardee may be required to complete the solicitation documents at the time of award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY - This action is funded by the Recovery Act
<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has issued a firm fixed price delivery order SS00-13-30100 against a GSA Federal Supply Schedule for the following: Quest Software vFoglight Pro Per CPU License, with 1 year support, QTY: 100. FOGLIGHT software is used to monitor the virtual server environment. This product provides enhanced and proactive monitoring and reporting and ensures increased optimization and better resource utilization management. SSA currently already has previously purchased copies of the software installed and in use at agency Data Canters. SSA has a requirement for additional licenses to satisfy that need for additional capacity.&nbsp;This acquisition is for additional software to handle increased demand. The agency cannot purchase a different brand because of interoperability issues and the proprietary nature of the software precludes using another item. SSA currently has an infrastructure built upon Quest software and maintenance. It would be extremely costly and time consuming to use a different brand at this stage. [FAR 8.405-6(b)(1) Brand name specifications shall not be used unless the particular brand name, product, or feature is essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs.] This notice is for information only; contractors should not respond.</p>

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 6, Asheville and Salem Medical Centers by means other than full and open competition.
 
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is a request for other than full and open completion for the procurement of C. Difficile/Epi 10 test kits from Cepheid.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The Medical Centers require C. Diff test kits which are used on the GenXpert analyzer owned by the stations.  The estimated cost is $44,160.00.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(g), as implemented by FAR 6.302.  

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  VISN-6 purchased analyzers capable of automated testing for MRSA and C. Diff.  The MRSA test kits are available through an FSS-BPA, but the C. Diff kits are not currently part of the Cepheid schedule.  The C. Diff test kit offers the fastest automated results of currently offered kits using an instrument the lab currently owns.  

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  None.
 
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Pricing offered to the Asheville VAMC is the same as pricing offered to all VAMC facilities. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  No market research was conducted as this purchase is for a component of an existing testing system.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  A new contract for automated RNA analysis will be competed in Spring 2013 which will include these tests.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Contracting Office Amarillo Network Contracting Activity 18, located at 6010 Amarillo Blvd West, Amarillo TX 79106 proposes to enter into a firm-fixed price contract on the basis of justification for other than full and open competition for the VA Amarillo Healthcare System.  The Contract/Purchase order number is VA258-13-P-0154/504-C30078. 

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  The contract contemplated will be firm fixed price service contract to Cummins Southern Plains, 5224 E. Interstate Expressway, Amarillo TX 79103, 806-370-3793. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The requirement is to provide the Amarillo VAMC emergency repair of the 550kw Generator serving the Chiller Plant and Hospital Air Conditioning system. The repair requires the disassembly of the rear half of the generator, replacement of the Exciter Rotor and Stator and reassembly of the generator.  After completion test run the generator and perform load bank test to assure generator is performing as needed.  The contractor is required to provide the service as soon as possible to prevent further damage to the facility or cause patient care issues.  Performance shall begin not later than one day after notice/authority to proceed. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c) (2), as implemented by FAR 6.302.2.

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       Or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  An unusual and compelling urgent requirement for the repair of the 550kw Generator is needed.  Cummins Southern Plains is the only combined original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and service provider with the equipment, personnel, system determined technical skills and expertise to repair this emergency within the Government's minimum required timeframe.   This Generator is the Emergency power for the Chiller Plant and Air Conditioning for the Hospital.  This is a situation which could result in damage to life and/or property clearly described in FAR 6.302-2.  The Generator failed on our monthly test run this morning and requires immediate repair. 
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:   FedBizOpps Posting:  The requirement will not be synopsized in accordance with 5.202(a)(2), in that this acquisition is being conducted under unusual and compelling urgency and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in 5.203.  

Efforts to Solicit Other Potential Sources:  Preliminary market research conducted by the Contract Specialist determined this was the only OEM available with the necessary equipment, skilled labor and staffing to repair the Generator within the timeframe required.  The requirement cannot be competed because the repair requires immediate repair.

Future Acquisition Strategy & Efforts:  This Generator is essential to the facility and must be repaired immediately in case of catastrophic failure.  Future efforts will follow procurement guidelines, in a way, as/if the 550kw Generator failure allows the timeframe to do so.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated dollar value for the contract action is for $20,000.  A check with both Thomas E. Creek Medical Center Maintenance & Operations Foreman, as well as local area contractors, found that hourly rates for the Texas Panhandle varied from $65 to $85 per hour normal rates, and time-and-a-half, or twice that rate for overtime/after hour's work.  The contractor, Cummins Southern Plains, charges $65 per hour regular rate, and $97.50 per hour concerning after hour rates.  Thus, the Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on historical price analysis as well as local market conditions as shown above.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was not conducted because of the criticality of this Generator in relationship to Life safety, etc. The requirement cannot be competed because the service is needed immediately to repair the system.  The Government's minimum requirement for schedule and technical capability for this service is satisfied only by this contractor.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Delay in award could possibly cause additional problems if we lose power and have no backup system to keep the chiller plant operating.  

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The proposed contract is a onetime one case emergent purchase.  This action allows the VA Amarillo Network Contracting Activity to repair the emergency.  Due to this action, the NCO will be able to complete the requirement for future endeavors.  The requirement has been identified and the acquisition planning will commence following the award of this contract.  A presolicititaion synopsis will be posted in accordance with FAR 5.201 for the new need.  

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
