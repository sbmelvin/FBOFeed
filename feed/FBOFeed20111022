<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies used to autonomously collect geotechnical data and use it to deduce geotechnical properties of the seafloor.  This data must be collected without direct physical interface to the seafloor in the specific mission area of interest.  It is assumed that the sensor utilized will not require a physical interface with the seafloor.   

Note that this announcement seeks a demonstration and proof of concept that would best satisfy the performance requirements.  Said demonstration would not require development of a self-contained prototype capable of being utilized in the field; only demonstration of a working instrument that collects and processes the data to provide the required geotechnical information.
    

Geophysical properties to be collected include: surface sediment classification, layering of sediments up to five meters below the surface, porosity, consistency, and a reasonable estimate of drained and un-drained soil shear strength.

This technology or methodology would ultimately be operated aboard a NAVY shipboard environment.  The term “shipboard environment” is meant to encompass operations from Navy, Military Sealift Command (MSC), and commercial platforms.  The term “autonomously collect” is used to signify that the system should be stand-alone, with the potential to be deployed as a module aboard an AUV or ROV system.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NAVFAC ESC) provides ocean engineering program management and technical services to the U.S. Navy for matters regarding seafloor geotechnical engineering.  This announcement seeks out laboratory test results and a preliminary analytical framework such that uncertainties in estimating soil strength from the results of geophysical tests can be quantified and reduced.

This task is part of a larger project titled “No-Touch Geophysical Strength Properties for Navy Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) and Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Systems.” It is relevant to note is that several sensors currently provide limited geotechnical information without requiring direct contact with the seafloor.
  Sub-Bottom Profiling, swath bathymetry, electro-resistivity, seismic refraction, and electromagnetic sensors are all examples of these techniques, several which are frequently utilized with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV’s) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV’s). As site specific correlations between soil strength and various geophysical measurements can be achieved, the preliminary controlled laboratory study requested is intended to highlight variability in these correlations for a range of geotechnical materials anticipated to be encountered in the upper 5 m of the seafloor. 

This announcement seeks out laboratory results and a preliminary analytical framework that can be used to assess the magnitude and uncertainty in geotechnical properties (e.g., void ratio, soil strength) estimated from the results of offshore geophysical surveys.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme, CA is seeking information on enhanced airfield maintenance vehicles that are designed to meet the following functions:

1.	General airfield cleaning to include runway and ramp 
2.	Rubber removal
3.	Paint stripe removal
4.	Spill response

General airfield ramp cleaning consists of removing debris from the surface that can pose a safety hazard to aircraft and can contribute to stormwater or ground pollution.  The vehicle must have the capacity to remove the debris from uneven surfaces, which can often contain sand and oil, from the airfield surface and collect this material for disposal.  The ability to remove the material from joints, padeyes and crevices around the airfield is essential.
  

Paint and tire removal should use a system designed to remove the material, but not damage the airfield surface.  Application of this technology will be on both the runway and the ramp area.  The system should be designed to maximize time on site performing these functions without periodic service stops, collect waste material, and recycle any material or resources used in this process.  Material dislodged and removed from the surface during the removal process should be collected for later disposal.  Exhaust of particulate matter should be filtered or minimized to reduce re-introduction of particulates to the environment.  
  
Spill response capability is targeted at contaminants such as fuels, oils, glycols, and other chemicals that can pose a significant threat to sensitive ecological systems.
  The spill response function consists of collection, storage, and a means to remove the collected contaminants from padeyes, and provide for disposal.  

Interested parties shall indicate whether they have available equipment that can target the four functions listed above.  Ideally, it is desired that all four function be performed by one single vehicle with the minimal amount of crew and support.  Advantages of this system are that it can be configured for multiple needs, reduce the maintenance window for airport operations, requires less manpower, reduce costs, and provide an environmentally safe solution to maintain airfield surfaces.

The principal recipients of this equipment are military activities of the Navy.
 In order to assist the activity manager in evaluating the cost/benefit of the candidate airfield maintenance vehicle, the following information will be desirable: specifications of the equipment, performance data, equipment configurations, estimated capital cost, estimated operation and maintenance costs, and return-on-investment calculation depending upon the best financial options.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

<DESC>Providing Attachment. 

The Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme, CA is seeking information on enhanced airfield maintenance vehicles that are designed to meet the following functions:

1.	General airfield cleaning to include runway and ramp 
2.	Rubber removal
3.	Paint stripe removal
4.	Spill response

General airfield ramp cleaning consists of removing debris from the surface that can pose a safety hazard to aircraft and can contribute to stormwater or ground pollution.  The vehicle must have the capacity to remove the debris from uneven surfaces, which can often contain sand and oil, from the airfield surface and collect this material for disposal.  The ability to remove the material from joints, padeyes and crevices around the airfield is essential.
  

Paint and tire removal should use a system designed to remove the material, but not damage the airfield surface.  Application of this technology will be on both the runway and the ramp area.  The system should be designed to maximize time on site performing these functions without periodic service stops, collect waste material, and recycle any material or resources used in this process.  Material dislodged and removed from the surface during the removal process should be collected for later disposal.  Exhaust of particulate matter should be filtered or minimized to reduce re-introduction of particulates to the environment.  
  
Spill response capability is targeted at contaminants such as fuels, oils, glycols, and other chemicals that can pose a significant threat to sensitive ecological systems.
  The spill response function consists of collection, storage, and a means to remove the collected contaminants from padeyes, and provide for disposal.  

Interested parties shall indicate whether they have available equipment that can target the four functions listed above.  Ideally, it is desired that all four function be performed by one single vehicle with the minimal amount of crew and support.  Advantages of this system are that it can be configured for multiple needs, reduce the maintenance window for airport operations, requires less manpower, reduce costs, and provide an environmentally safe solution to maintain airfield surfaces.
