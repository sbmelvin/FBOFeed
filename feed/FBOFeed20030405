Aside from the rent to be paid as set forth in the lease, the USG shall provide no funding for design or construction.  The developer shall provide all monies necessary for the development and long-term ownership of the property.  The lease shall also have an option for the USG to purchase the property at an agreed price.

In order to be considered, expressions of interest must include information on the following: (1) Firm background - Provide the name, street address, and contact information for the developer and anyone who has an ownership interest in such developer.  Demonstrate that the principal firm undertaking the development has successfully completed projects of similar size and scope within similar time frames.

Provide evidence of your financial status and ability to obtain sufficient construction and long-term financing to complete the project; (2) Proposed site/building - Indicate upon what tract of land, or in what neighborhood, you would propose to locate the consulate.  At the time that formal bids are submitted, you must control (i.e. own, long-term lease or have an option to purchase) the land that is to be used for the consulate.  If you have the information presently available, please indicate the size, location and general description of the site and/or building designated for the consulate and demonstrate your control of such property (i.e. deed, long-term lease or option to purchase); and (3) American-owned bidders - If you want to be eligible for a 10% preference that might be available under 22 U.S.C. 302 to ?american-owned? bidders, provide evidence of (a) performance of similar construction work in the United States, and (b) either ownership in excess of 50% by United States citizens or permanent residence, or incorporation in the United States for more than three years and employment of United States citizens or permanent residents in more than half of the corporation's permanent full-time professional and managerial positions in the United States.
