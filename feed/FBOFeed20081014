<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>This BAA is a contracting tool directly responsive to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Focused Long Term Challenge (FLTC) 5's Integrated Cyber Defense attribute.</p>
<p>Proactively defend cyberspace by anticipating and avoiding threats through understanding the cyber situation, predicting adversarial actions, assessing potential impacts, and by implementing deterrence and effects based defensive methodologies. Detect and defeat threats and protect information systems by engagement and influence through defensive mechanisms employing such methods as adversary denial and deception. Adaptively maintain, organize, and automatically regenerate and reconstitute resources to ensure continued mission operations.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate is soliciting whitepapers for FLTC focus areas and Computer Network, Defense &amp; Support. The following section provides a description of six FLTC focus areas within FLTC 5's Integrated Cyber Defense attribute and a general description of the Computer Network Defense (CND) &amp; Support Technology base.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC for each FLTC focus area is provided for QUESTIONS ONLY. See Section IV Paragraph 6 for submission details.</p>
<p><br />Strategic Cyber Defense</p>
<p>Background: Many describe cyberspace as a domain that favors the attacker. This reality is largely due to the reactive mindset that currently dominates our approach to cyber defense. Defensive operations are constantly playing "catch up" to an ever-increasing onslaught of attacks that seem to always stay one step ahead. In order to tip the balance in favor of the defender, we must develop a strategic approach to cyber defense that transcends the day to day reactive operations and provides the means to conduct defense in a proactive, goal-oriented fashion using systems that are robust and can be trusted to support the mission.</p>
<p>Objective: Avoid threats entirely by obviating the effects of adversary actions, deterring attacks, and anticipating threats and proactively reshaping our defensive posture. Avoidance eliminates the need to fight or respond, and may be achieved by three avenues, each of which is described below.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Strategic Cyber Defense" focus area will be concerned with the following research challenges, but other approaches that achieve the stated objective will be considered:</p>
<p>First, most threats should be made irrelevant by eliminating vulnerabilities beforehand. In accordance with established anti-tamper tenets, vulnerabilities can be eliminated beforehand by either moving them "out of band" (i.e., making them technically or physically inaccessible to the adversary), or "designing them out" completely through systematic design practices. Furthermore, since cyberspace is a man-made technological domain, the "laws" of cyberspace can be re-written, and therefore the domain can be modified at any level to favor defensive forces. We need to modify, extend, or replace vulnerable and insufficient protocols, architectures, instruction sets, etc. as necessary to secure critical warfighting systems. This concept of conducting cyber operations with assured systems is as basic as flightworthiness is to air operations, but is many times neglected. Technologies supporting this component of strategic cyber defense include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>&bull; Methods for implementing "Information Assurance (IA) inside": Assured and trustworthy systems and compositions of systems, typically from untrustworthy components<br />&bull; Techniques to guarantee assurance and trustworthiness attributes, potentially through application of advancements in the Anti-tamper and Software protection fields of research<br />&bull; Automatic vulnerability identification and mitigation<br />&bull; Secure protocol design<br />&bull; Techniques for automated diversity: for example via instruction set, address space, and program structure randomization to render code-specific attacks inoperative, while guaranteeing correctness and safety of randomized code<br />&bull; "Operating System-less" computer architectures</p>
<p>Second, avoiding the threat becomes possible if the perceived cost of attacking can be raised, and/or if the benefits of attacking can be lowered, and/or if the threat of retaliation is credible. Technologies of interest here include any that help enable a future National policy of cyber deterrence, including (but not limited to):</p>
<p>&bull; Threat traceback and attribution (to include determination of intent)<br />&bull; Threat geolocation<br />&bull; Adversary understanding and cost models (i.e., risk vs. reward)<br />&bull; Measurement and control of adversary perception of Air Force network capabilities<br />&bull; Information valuation<br />&bull; Denial of adversary's situation awareness and understanding, while avoiding conflicts with friendly information operations<br />&bull; Means to measure and determine equity in response</p>
<p>Finally, imminent and active threats will be avoided by way of anticipation followed by immediate evasive action. Anticipating a cyber threat includes setting up early indications &amp; warnings (I&amp;W) mechanisms that detect anomalous activities or entities, rapidly analyzing the corresponding feature set of the activity (to include attribution and geolocation), predicting future behaviors and effects, and provisioning agile defensive systems in the most effective way. Avoiding threats in real-time is accomplished through the use of polymorphic techniques to present an agile "moving target" that allows systems to employ evasion tactics, and escape tactics if a viable threat is confronted. The ability to modify the domain will be leveraged so that modification can take place many times per second at multiple layers of networking. Thus, the attacker loses the advantage of time and the benefit of previously collected intelligence. Technologies supporting this component of strategic cyber defense include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>&bull; Cyber indications and warnings, distant early warning<br />&bull; Escape and evasion techniques<br />&bull; " Everything-hopping" (rapidly reconfigurable system and network parameters, re-addressable nodes)<br />&bull; Dynamic protocols<br />&bull; Masking and obfuscation of critical Air Force network components<br />&bull; Polymorphic communication, networking and computing systems<br />&bull; Secure "Network IFF" - Identification Friend or Foe</p>
<p>When threats cannot be avoided by obviating effects or deterring execution, we must have the means to defeat them and survive the attacks in cases where they cannot be completely defeated. These aspects of cyber defense, which complete a true defense in depth capability, are addressed in the remainder of the areas described by the BAA.</p>

<p><br />Global Cyber Situational Understanding</p>
<p>Background: Situation Awareness (SA) as defined by Dr. Mica Endsley is a "state of knowledge" and is inherently oriented towards the human mind (Endsley, M.R. "Theoretical Underpinnings of Stituational Awareness: A Critical Review). What this research area addresses is research and development of the processes which "achieve, acquire, or maintain SA". The SA Reference Model created by AFRL captures these processes diagrammatically. These processes include various components of SA such as; perception (data, object, and situation assessment), comprehension (situation, threat, and impact assessment of the now), and projection (threat and impact assessment of plausible futures). All aspects of SA are considered for a myriad of cyber operators ranging from network security analysts, to cyber attack, to commanders.</p>
<p>Objective: The goal of the Cyber Situational Understanding area is to enable situation awareness for cyber operators by applying various technologies and visualization techniques.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Global Cyber Situational Understanding" focus area will be concerned with the following research challenges, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>&bull; Enabling Human perception of N-dimensional cyberspace<br />&bull; Validating the authenticity or value of cyber event data (e.g. ensure it is not spoofed or misleading)<br />&bull; Developing meaningful cyber defense metrics<br />&bull; Developing appropriate cyber event &lsquo;observables'</p>

<p>Incorruptible Data Codes / Executables</p>
<p>Background: The Department of Defense (DoD) requires trustworthy data and software executables for successful performance of assigned missions. However, despite existing security measures designed to prevent malicious manipulation of data and executable (both static and dynamic), a determined party can easily manipulate both data and software executables on commercial off the shelf (COTS) information systems. Recently the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has invested in the Software Protection Initiative (SPI) to pursue research and development in an array of technologies for prevention of piracy, malicious tampering, and reverse engineering of DoD application software. The technologies developed and the research outcomes of SPI form the foundation for continued advancement of capabilities the DoD requires to assure trust in the data and executables.</p>
<p>Objective: Deliver self-contained verifiably incorruptible/trustworthy data and executables while at rest, under execution, or in transit upon and within any environment/system relevant to the warfighter. This includes both our own systems and systems that we do not own or directly control.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Incorruptible Data Codes / Executables" focus area is interested in the research challenges identified below. However, different approaches and concepts deemed to have significant potential to achieve the stated objectives will be considered.</p>
<p>&bull; Data (easily manipulated, many types, can be highly complex, comes from trusted and untrusted sources, utilized in a multitude of diverse environments) <br />&bull; Measuring and verifying incorruptibility/trust <br />&bull; Software-only data and executable protections <br />&bull; Data and executable self-protection<br />&bull; Hardware assisted data and executable protections</p>
<p>&bull; Development and technical evaluation and refinement of watermarking algorithms and, in particular, protocols for the purpose of information provenance, pedigree, and assurance<br />o Addressing all forms of data and multimedia formats; to include: images, audio, video, formatted and raw data types<br />o Protocols with provable security which incorporate other accepted security mechanisms (timestamping, hashing, key exchange, etc.)<br />o Disadvantaged, rich and heterogeneous environments/platforms. Focus on DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) applications and scenarios<br />o Particular emphasis on:<br />&#61607; Interaction of watermarked data with watermarked/secured code which has Anti-Tamper and Protection guarantees<br />&#61607; Watermarking algorithms and protocols which provide multiple aspects (provenance, pedigree, assurance) while working in conjunction with data for specific application (sensing, etc)</p>

<p>Cybercraft</p>
<p>Background: The Cybercraft focus area seeks to provide combatant commanders with a root of trust for defending the computer network upon which US dominance in Air, Space, and Cyberspace relies. The Cybercraft system provides a trusted platform for automated command, control, communications (C3), and delivery of defensive cyber capabilities.</p>
<p>Objective: The Cybercraft focus area aims to address critical Air Force cyber defense issues including the disparity between time-to-attack and time-to-defend, trust of current cyber defenses, and situational awareness in cyberspace. Core Cybercraft components include the following: Platform - Hardware "root of trust" which enables trusted execution of payloads and ensures a user with root access to the underlying system cannot compromise the Cybercraft system. Payloads - Platform-specific executables that provide specific capabilities. Categories of payloads include sensors (sense the environment), effectors (change the environment) and decision engines (interpret policy and issue commands). Policies - Encode the commander's intent or rules of engagement in a machine-readable format. Cybercraft Store - Provides non-volatile storage of commands, payloads, policies, and environment data. Operator Interface - Allows Cybercraft operators to upload new policies, new payload executables, and issue commands to one or more Cybercraft platforms. Visualization - Provides multi-level, geospatial, logical, and dynamic situational awareness and mission mapping for commanders and Cybercraft operators.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The Cybercraft focus area will be concerned with the following research challenges, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>&bull; Map and Mission Context - Cybercraft aims to provide situational awareness and mission mapping of the Air Force cyber domain at operational, tactical, and strategic levels. This area includes delivering geospatial, logical, and dynamic visualizations of millions of cyber assets, mapping these assets to the warfighting missions they support, and developing the operator interface.<br />&bull; Environment Description - This research area involves creating an ontology and machine-readable knowledge representation to enable the Cybercraft system to respond in an autonomous policy-driven manner. The defined structures shall capture tactical, operational, and strategic data about the Cybercraft system and its environment.<br />&bull; C3 Protocols and Architecture - This area consists of defining a C3 protocol and architecture to allow multiple Cybercraft to conduct coordinated operations. This also includes providing a persistent Cybercraft store of what is known about the network. The Cybercraft store must be secure, scalable, reliable, and should have no single point of failure.<br />&bull; Formal Model and Policy - Executing attacks in cyberspace take seconds but defending against attacks takes hours, days, or weeks. Cybercraft aims to provide a policy-driven, automated defense of cyberspace. This necessitates building a formal model and policy for Cybercraft to ensure behavior conforms to a commander's intent. The policy must enable scalability up to millions of cyber assets, balance the conflicting requirements of ease of policy creation and power of expression, and provide a mechanism for policy conflict resolution.<br />&bull; Trust and Self Protection Guarantee - The integrity of current cyber defense tools (e.g. anti-virus scanners, host-based intrusion detection systems) hinges on the integrity of the host root account. The results of this research area shall provide a formally modeled hardware root of trust that imparts immunity from an adversary with root access to the underlying host. <br />&bull; Interfaces and Payloads - This area involves defining standard interfaces (e.g. Cybercraft-to-host, Cybercraft-to-environment, Cybercraft-to-payload, and Cybercraft-to-Cybercraft) to facilitate extensibility, evolution, and interoperability. These interfaces must enable integration of disparate and unforeseen technologies.</p>

<p>Assured Load Balancing Enterprise</p>
<p>Background: The DoD has a critical need for information systems that adapt and/or gracefully degrade when unexpected events occur. These systems are subjected to constant change such as overload, component failure, cyber attacks, evolving operational requirements, and/or a dynamic operational environment. Most mission critical systems do not have adaptation mechanisms to support Quality of Service (QoS) (functionality) and/or Quality of Information Assurance (QoIA) (security) in the presence of unpredictable anomalies. A system should adapt to these changes by reconfiguring its resources to provide a different, though acceptable, level of service and/or security to its users. Without adaptation many important activities receive fewer resources than needed while less important activities waste resources by receiving more resources than necessary. Most existing systems either do not adapt or have ad hoc hardwired mechanisms to accommodate only a small, predefined, set of changes. There are no standard methodologies or common tools to assist application developers in managing this sort of adaptation.</p>
<p>QoS to most people only deals with network/communication performance (for example diffserv, intserv, Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPV6). The QoS that is being described in this FLTC focus area is a holistic approach which incorporates the user, application, middleware and communications substrate. QoS is a service-based system that must manage/control: processing, data management, and communication resources on an end-to-end basis to support the mission critical user/application. The Air Force has invested in this holistic approach to QoS, but much more work needs to be done.</p>
<p>QoIA is a holistic approach to security. We need to be able to quantitatively measure, characterize and control various dimensions of security (availability, integrity and confidentiality) based on user/application requirements. Many security mechanisms exist in research, COTS and government off the shelf (GOTS) that cover the various dimensions of security. What is lacking and what is the main focus of this work is quantitative measurement and fine-grained control to better characterize and utilize the security mechanisms based on mission requirement and/or user needs.</p>
<p>Objective: Preserve mission critical functions, while controlling &amp; conveying trustworthiness. The "Assured Load Balancing Enterprise" focus area will develop the tools and technology to realize computer-based systems (i.e., systems composed of hardware, software, and human entities) that tolerate, adapt and/or gracefully degrade based on user (mission-critical) requirements. Information systems must adapt and/or gracefully degrade to provide a guaranteed level of Quality of Service (QoS - functionality (processing, data management and communication)) and Quality of Information Assurance (QoIA - security (measuring and controlling information assurance in Cyber Space)) to the information system enterprise during system overload, component failure, and cyber attacks. This focus area will look at what it means to gracefully degrade QoS and QoIA and what the tradeoff space is between the two. This focus area will also develop QoS and QoIA aware mechanisms and survivability/assurance architectures to guarantee end-to-end QoS and QoIA by adapting and/or gracefully degrading to support mission-critical information enterprise requirements. The realization and enforcement of end-to-end QoS and QoIA implies a degree of control that is fine-grained and extensive. Therefore, an accompanying challenge to creating mechanisms for realizing and enforcing end-to-end QoS and QoIA is to protect those very same mechanisms.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Assured Load Balancing Enterprise" focus area will be concerned with the following research challenges, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>&bull; Cyber Defense Metrics<br />o Formalizing QoS &amp; QoIA so they can be quantifiably described, specified, measured and managed based on mission requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Graceful Degradation - Trade Space of QoS &amp; QoIA<br />o Understanding the trade space of QoS and QoIA on an end-to-end basis <br />o Identifying the mechanisms and conditions that influence QoIA and how they complement or interfere with QoS<br />o Developing algorithms that perform application-based trade space balancing between QoS (functionality) and QoIA (security)<br />o Creating a taxonomy of QoS and QoIA services<br />o Policy development and de-confliction</p>
<p>&bull; Assured End to End QoS &amp; QoIA - (Survivability Architecture)<br />o Composing a survivability architecture that incorporates service delivery and information assurance requirements<br />o Measuring a system's QoS and QoIA capacity at both design time and runtime<br />o Control plane mechanisms to monitor and adapt system performance to guarantee end-to-end QoS and QoIA<br />o Policy enforcement<br />o Adapting and/or gracefully degrading (per application-based, user-provided policy/requirements) QoS and QoIA individually and with respect to each other during malicious and non-malicious faults<br />o Developing a QoS/QoIA dashboard for control of and visibility into system performance</p>
<p>&bull; Understanding how the layers of cyber defense, COTS, and legacy code impact QoS and QoIA</p>

<p>Self-Regenerating Incorruptible Enterprise</p>
<p>Background: Existing approaches to information system security and survivability consist of preventing, detecting and containing unintentional errors and/or cyber attacks. These systems use static means to survive, but are unable to adapt, learn, tolerate and/or reconstitute dynamically in response to unforeseen errors and/or unknown cyber attacks. These systems simply fail miserably when subjected to previously unknown events. Recent research has demonstrated the ability to tolerate errors and/or attacks and gracefully degrade with respect to user (mission critical) requirements. The problem with this approach is that regardless of how well systems are protected or how well they tolerate errors and/or attacks; they will eventually fail over time unless they have the ability to self-regenerate. On the positive side, systems that tolerate by gracefully degrading service buy time to learn the root cause of errors and attacks, thereby providing valuable knowledge to the self-regeneration process. What are needed are information systems that are able to adapt, learn, tolerate and/or reconstitute dynamically in response to unforeseen errors and/or unknown cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Objective: The objective of this "Self Regenerative, Incorruptible Enterprise" focus area is to fight through cyber attacks by enabling information systems to learn, regenerate themselves in response to unforeseen errors and/or attacks, and automatically improve their ability to deliver critical services. If successful, self-regenerative systems will reconstitute the information systems back to its initial operating capability while decreasing their vulnerability to an ever-increasing number of attacks.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Self Regenerative, Incorruptible Enterprise" product will create persistent information systems and data. Persistent information systems and data are hard to disable or remove (like malware). This focus area will look at malware for techniques that can be utilized to make software more robust. Another focus area will be to use biologically inspired diversity to dynamically create and compose immune components. Information systems must automatically recognize and learn about novel cyber and service attacks to dynamically create immunized versions of information system components and data. Information systems and data must have redundancy and the ability to regenerate required functionality with increased error/attack immunity, whereby corrupted components can be regenerated without negatively affecting the whole system. This focus area will be concerned with the following research challenges, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>&bull; Persistent applications and data<br />&bull; Reconstitution of data and state<br />&bull; Dynamically recognize, characterize and understand novel cyber attacks and service anomalies (understand root cause)<br />&bull; New approaches to software development (model based, specification based, component based, flow based, etc)<br />&bull; Dynamic synthetic diversity (machine generated correct, immune, and composable functionally equivalent software components)<br />&bull; Synchronizing repair activities without interrupting ongoing mission priorities<br />&bull; Self optimization with respect to achieving incorruptibility (restore initial operating capacity while reducing vulnerabilities to errors and attacks)</p>

<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>AFRL/RIGA will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their white paper submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY. Prior to award, the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:<br />TPOC Name: Patrick Hurley<br />Telephone: (315) 330-3624<br />Email: Patrick.hurley@rl.af.mil</p>
<p>(Alternate) TPOC Name: Jason Siegfried<br />Telephone: (315) 330-3326<br />Email: Jason.Siegfried@rl.af.mil</p>

<p>Lynn White<br />Telephone (315) 330-4996<br />Email: Lynn.White@rl.af.mil</p>
<p>The email must reference the solicitation (BAA) number and title of the acquisition.<br />In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Aug 2005) will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA. The AFRL Ombudsman is as follows:</p>
<p>Susan Hunter<br />Building 15, Room 225<br />1864 Fourth Street<br />Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130<br />FAX: (937) 225-5036; Comm: (937) 255-7754</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
ENTERPRISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DATA REPOSITORY
(Information Technology - Life-Cycle Support/Baseline Change Request Modifications and Technical Support Services)

The 554th Electronic Systems Group, Business and Medical Information Systems Division, Information Systems Branch (554 ELSG/SBI), at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB), Ohio is conducting a Sources Sought Synopsis to identify companies who have the capabilities to provide Information Technology (IT) Life-Cycle Support/Baseline Change Request Modifications and Technical Support Services.  These services will support the United States Air Force (AF) infrastructure support system, Enterprise Information Technology Data Repository (EITDR).  
The EITDR Program Management Office (PMO) and the Contracting Officer will use the results to determine if the contract requirements for the acquisition of services for both the Life-Cycle Support/Baseline Change Request Modifications and the Technical Support Services can be combined into one contract or remain as separate acquisitions.  
The period of performance for the basic contract is 05 August 2009 through 04 August 2010, with additional coverage of four one-year options through 04 August 2014.  The contract vehicle has not been determined, and this decision will be determined by the results of this survey.  The current Life-Cycle Support/Baseline Change Request Modifications and Technical Support Services are two individual Time and Materials contracts.
This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP).  This is a market research survey to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing an RFP.  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.
The North American Industrial Classification System Code is 541519 for the overall program with an anticipated size standard of $23M.  We are seeking and open to all types of small business participation.
The place of performance is Wright-Patterson AFB with associated travel to supporting bases to provide training, testing, and support for technical interchange meetings.  Training will encompass both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) travel.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the water distribution system for the Louisville Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located in Louisville, Kentucky, to Louisville Water Company.   Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. Louisville Water Company (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The water system being privatized is described as follows: The 123rd Airlift Wing (AW) of the Kentucky Air National Guard occupies two parcels of leased land on the Louisville International Airport (IAP); one of 76 acres and the other of 5.  The base is located on the northeast side of the airport approximately five miles south of downtown Louisville, Kentucky. The mission of the 123rd AW is to provide worldwide theater airlift for U.S. military and to support humanitarian operations. The unit occupies four administrative, six industrial and two services buildings totaling approximately 355,000 square feet.  The 123rd has 334 full-time personnel, a number that surges once a month to 1,180 personnel during unit training drills. Water is supplied by Louisville Water Company and enters the base at three points.  The configuration is a looped system with dead-end branches, with water delivered at 75 psig.  The distribution system consists of approximately 15,400 linear feet of PVC pipe.  Piping diameter ranges from two to twelve inches. Piping is buried at an average depth of three feet with the use of marking tape. The system also has 15 cast iron gate valves, four post indicator valves and 15 fire hydrant assemblies. Base personnel indicate the capacity of the current system is adequate for present and future needs.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2001 and no offers were received. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the system; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the electric and gas distribution systems for the Louisville Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located in Louisville, Kentucky, to Louisville Gas and Electric (LG&E).   Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  LG&E (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The electric and gas systems being privatized are described as follows: The 123rd Airlift Wing (AW) of the Kentucky Air National Guard occupies two parcels of leased land on the Louisville International Airport (IAP); one of 76 acres and the other of 5.  A portion of the electrical system on the 76-acre parcel is already privatized and is owned by Louisville Gas & Electric (LG&E). The electrical system on the 5-acre portion of the base is already privatized and is owned by LG&E. The entire gas system servicing the 5-acre parcel is already privatized.  It is owned by LG&E.   The base is located on the northeast side of the airport approximately five miles south of downtown Louisville, Kentucky. The mission of the 123rd  AW is to provide worldwide theater airlift for U.S. military and to support humanitarian operations. The unit occupies four administrative, six industrial and two services buildings totaling approximately 355,000 square feet.  The 123rd has 334 full-time personnel, a number that surges once a month to 1,180 personnel during unit training drills. Power is provided by Louisville Gas & Electric (LG&E) and enters the base and is metered at a single location. It is delivered and distributed at 13.8 (kV) through a delta distribution system. The primary distribution system consists of approximately 5,700 linear feet of 15kV rated, 3-phase underground circuits, all in ductbanks. The underground circuits are buried at an average depth of three feet and are marked with tracer wire. Multiple branches feed nine three-phase pad-mounted transformers ranging from 225 to 1,500 kVA and one 25 kVA single-phase transformer.  The system includes eight concrete vaults, 15 fuses and 2 switches.  Although the peak demand is unknown, base personnel indicate the capacity of the current system is adequate for present and future needs. Natural gas service is provided by the Louisville Gas & Electric Company.  It enters the base at a single point near the main gate. The configuration is a dead-end distribution system with gas delivered at 90 psig and distributed at 14 psig. The distribution system contains approximately 4,600 linear feet of steel pipe ranging from two to six inches in diameter.  Pipes are buried at an average depth of four feet and are not marked with tracer wire.  The system contains seven steel plug valves, nine meters, ten regulators, and ten sacrificial anodes. Base personnel indicate the capacity of the current system is adequate for present and future needs.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2001 and no offers were received on the gas distribution system. One offer was received on the electric distribution system, which was subsequently withdrawn. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the system; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. 

The Center for Developmental Biology and Perinatal Medicine (CDBPM), Mental Retardation & Developmental Disabilities (MRDD) Branch, within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) and HHSAR 306.302-1 (a) (2) (ii), a modification to its current contract with the University of Maryland at Baltimore (UMB), entitled Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders. This four month contract extension is necessary in order to avoid a lapse in contract performance and continue services in its operation of the NICHD Brain and Tissue Bank. This modification will allow UMB to continue uninterrupted services until a new competitive contract can be awarded and the services transitioned. 

UMB, as the incumbent contractor, collects and houses the tissue specimens from individuals with disorders as well as normal tissue for control studies.  UMB has the expertise in rapidly collecting tissue from newly deceased donors, processing the tissue and making it available for qualified researchers through a Material Transfer Agreement.  In addition, UMB ensures quality standards for the repository samples including rapid collection of donor tissue, long term storage conditions, fixation procedures and fresh frozen storage conditions.  

This modification will extend the contract to allow a continuation of this project and time for transitioning to the new contract.  It is very critical that the services provided not to be interrupted, as interruption of this project would result in a loss of valuable specimens.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting information (5 page limit) required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 45 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Intramural Research Program (IRP), National Institute on Aging (NIA), Laboratory of Experimental Gerontology (LEG) intends to award a Sole Source contract to Stereology Resource Center, Inc., 104 Ringneck Court, Chester, MD 21619-2354; for a professional services contrat to assist the laboratory with its uses of computerized stereology systems for generating stereological results to support a variety of scientific projects.   The Stereologer systems were purchased from Systems Planning and Analysis, Inc., Alexandria, VA, which developed and commercialized the system under support from a Phase I/II fast tract Small Business Innovative Research Grant, in conjunction with the Department of Pathology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Dr. Peter R. Mouton of the Stereology Research Center (SCR).  A Stereologer system consist of Macintosh- or PC-compatible software for analysis of first-order stereological parameters (number, volume, surface area, and length) and their variation from the appearance of objects of interest on 2-D tissue sections.  The hardware of these systems consist of either a Zeiss or Nikon microscope equipped with high-resolution optics interfaced to montorized X-Y-Z stage, video camera/monitor, video card, and computer.  This integrated hardware-software system allows a trained user to generate unbiased (assumption-and model-free) stereological results from a systematic set of tissue sections through a defined reference space.  The generation of accurate, precise, and efficient results using this equipment requires theoretical and practical training to avoid both stereological and non-stereological sources of bias, including expert knowledge of stereology, study design, computerized image analyses, staining and sampling of tissue, and neuroanatomy.    This support is required to maintain high throughput and make effective use of computerized stereology approaches in LEG studies.  This contract includes all direct and indirect costs, as well as annual maintenance agreement and software upgrades for the two Stereologer ystems.  This vendor has expert credentials to meet the requirements for this contract.  He has two decades of solid training and experience in neurobiology, and is an internationally recognized expert in the use of unbiased stereology for neurobiological applications.  Period of Performance October 2008 through September 2009.

<DESC>USAID Kenya awarded the Kenya Horticultural Development Program (KHDP) contract to Fintrac Inc. in September 2003 and implementation started in October 2003. Results to date have been impressive and KHDP has contributed significantly to increased incomes for smallholders in the horticulture sector. KHDP has trained more than 40,000 growers since the start of the program and has also contributed to national policy initiatives which support the growth of domestic, regional and export markets. More than 70 collaborative alliances with key private sector businesses continue to enhance sector competitiveness in markets. Various NGOs and public sector agencies also collaborate with KHDP. 

Since the start of the program, Kenyan horticultural exports have increased by 40% to $700 million while domestic market growth is estimated at 5-10% per annum. New income since 2003 through employment and smallholder production for the horticulture industry is estimated at $16 million. It is widely acknowledged by industry stakeholders that USAIDs KHDP has contributed to this growth.

The Government of Kenya and USAID Kenya recognize the important role of horticulture in alleviating poverty through increased food production and income generation in rural areas. Furthermore, the industry has strong growth potential, particularly in crops and products which can be grown by smallholders, and has strong multiplier effects on other economic sectors. USAID Kenya is committed to supporting the industry subject to availability of funds. 

To avoid loss of momentum, contribute to sector re-establishment after post December 2007 election crisis; and to allow time to design and introduce a new program for competitive bidding and award, it is proposed that Fintracs current contract be extended for six months from the current end date of September 30, 2008 through March 31, 2009. USAID Kenya will be exercising option clause 52.217-8 to modify the contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>SUSTAINABLE WATER & SANITATION ACTIVITY IN AFRICA (SUWASA)
STATEMENT OF WORK


A.	PROGRAM SUMMARY

USAID intends to solicit proposals seeking a contractor to strengthen water and sanitation utility governance, reform, and finance as a necessary precondition to expand and improve water services, particularly for the poor.  Building on the success of on-going water reform initiatives within the region, the Sustainable Water & Sanitation in Africa (SUWASA) activity will demonstrate the effectiveness of commercially viable innovations to expand water and sanitation services on a sustainable basis into underserved communities.

The activity will run for four years with an option to extend for two one-year increments.  USAIDs Africa Bureau; Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade Bureau; and, Missions will make up to $20 million available for the complete program period of performance of this regional program.  

The activity will provide technical assistance, commodities, and small capital grants to support specific reform initiatives that improve management, delivery and finance of water and sanitation services. All USAID presence countries in Africa will eligible for reform support under this contract.  The activity will also support innovative approaches to (1) expand water and sanitation services into slum and peri-urban areas and (2) provide for stronger institutional and financing frameworks for water and sanitation services in rural villages.  In addition, SUWASA may also help to establish sustainable financing mechanisms for the water sector by assisting to develop water revolving funds in countries that have credible plans for the development of such funds.  Partnerships with the private sector will be encouraged during technical assistance under this contract, and will be critical to the success of this program.

B.	PROGRAM OBJECTIVE

USAID is bringing the blue revolution to sub-Saharan Africa by implementing a comprehensive approach to improving water and sanitation services.  USAID aims to build stronger water and sanitation utilities, improve the regulatory environment, build capacity for integrated water resources management, and develop innovative methods to spur local investment.  In addition, programs can address transboundary management issues and use water as an entre point to build local capacity to mitigate and manage conflict.  The objective of the SUWASA activity is to promote the development and transfer of innovative practices in water and sanitation utility reform, and to demonstrate sustainable business models for expanding services to poor consumers.  
 
 

C.	BACKGROUND 

Sub-Saharan Africa is struggling to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) target of halving the proportion of people living without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015.  The region is experiencing the highest rates of urban growth in the world with most of that growth occurring in slums with no access to basic environmental services.  A burgeoning population, limited financing and capacity at the national and local levels combined with conflicts throughout the region are stressing already weak systems.  Meanwhile, countries struggle to find sustainable models to provide water and sanitation systems for their population remaining in traditional villages.  

While the overall picture may be grim, some countries in sub-Saharan Africa have made great strides in developing the necessary policy and governance frameworks to improve the performance of basic water and sanitation services, the reforms are just beginning to show larger scale increases in access to improved services. Experience is showing that countries that adopt well designed water utility reform plans are substantially improving access to services, financial capacity to sustain and expand services, and the quality of services provided. Examples such as Uganda, Cote dIvoire, Senegal and Zambia show that reform works.  Of particular note, reformed utilities have shown dramatic ability to expand quality water and sanitation services to the poor. 

The types of reforms that have been demonstrated to be successful in fixing troubled water and sanitation utilities include: 

	Corporatization and introduction of improved procedures and mechanisms for corporate governance; 
	Use of operating contracts between the utility and the public agency responsible for supervising water companies; 
	Introduction of incentives for employees that directly tie bonuses to performance improvements;
	Introduction of improved commercial systems, including metering and metered billing;
	Introduction of effective economic regulation; and 
	Models for delivering services to poor consumers that are financially sustainable and tailored to local needs.

There are also a number of associations, initiatives, capacity building programs and capital investment projects in the region that can serve as partner organizations to support reform efforts.  These include the African Water Utility Operators Partnership, the African Water Association, the Water & Sanitation Program, and the International Water Association.

In addition many donors in partnership with NGOs have sought to create sustainable models for community-based systems in rural villages.  While a number of successful models have been demonstrated, long-term sustainability and access to capital remain significant challenges to expanding these models to greater parts of rural Africa.

D.	STATEMENT OF WORK

D.1.	Overview

There have been remarkable and well documented successes in improving water supply and sanitation services in sub-Saharan Africa as a result of utility reforms. Good examples include Uganda, Senegal, Cote dIvoire, Burkina Faso, and Mozambique. However, many countries in Africa have not yet embarked on reforms, or if they have, some have run into implementation problems. Clearly, at this time, there are immediate opportunities to build on successes in countries like Uganda and Senegal, and to spread these effective innovations to other African countries.  There is an opportunity to work with countries  and individual utilities  to introduce the reforms that have proven to be effective in expanding access to water and sanitation services.  In addition, where reforms have been implemented at the sector and utility level, there are opportunities to develop sustainable financing mechanisms, such as revolving funds, to finance infrastructure investments.

The SUWASA activity will support up to 15 local reform initiatives either at the utility level on specific management or service delivery issues or at the national level on sector reforms such as financing in five or more countries.  The activity will use the existing Africa-wide water organizations as a platform to identify specific reform initiatives, and then will provide assistance to design and implement reform initiatives that have succeeded in other countries.  The contractor may also assist Missions in designing activities to be implemented through other mechanisms.  The regional water organizations will also be used to showcase successful models and transfer knowledge and practices to other places committed to reform.

While there have been fewer efforts directed at improving sanitation services to date, the public health benefits and the related impacts on economic productivity from access to proper sanitation warrants greater attention.  For those utilities that have responsibility for both water and sewerage, the SUWASA activity may help reforming utilities expand sanitation services to cities and towns (5,000 to 300,000 residents) in addition to improving access to water.  A variety of approaches to improving sanitation that are cheaper than large scale wastewater treatment systems can be implemented, including sanitary drainage, improved latrines and community toilets. 

The SUWASA utility governance and reform efforts will build on experiences developed through USAIDs EcoAsia (Annex 2) and Blue Revolution (Annex 3) programs.  SUWASA will include reform activities that demonstrate solutions to key water and sanitation issues and a regional learning network to share lessons learned.  The regional focus will be addressed through developing sub-Saharan utility leadership forums and providing opportunities for technical twinning partnerships or internships to transfer knowledge and good practices from one utility to another.

It is anticipated that SUWASA will concentrate on supporting specific water and sanitation utility reform initiatives as outlined above. USAID Missions may fund parallel activities designed to expand services in slum and peri-urban areas covered by utilities that are in the reform process. This will ensure that the new services in slum and peri-urban areas are being delivered by utilities that are able to sustain the infrastructure and maintain services after completion of the SUWASA activity. These Mission-funded slum and peri-urban expansion activities may be carried either through a transfer of funds to SUWASA, or through a grant or project activity that is developed parallel to SUWASAs reform activity. 

D.2.	Technical Direction

While USAID has supported water and sanitation utility reform efforts in other regions, there have been few projects to address water utility reform in sub-Saharan Africa.  Few Missions have technical staff equipped to address utility reform issues.  More importantly, as Missions address water and sanitation reform issues (or change the mix of activities they implement) it will be important for Missions to know what are the best approaches and lessons learned.  Due to the limited technical knowledge or experience of field staff, this program will be managed by USAID/Washington.  The Contract will be managed by the Economic Growth, Agriculture & Trade Bureau (EGAT) with policy direction and substantial involvement from the Bureau for Africa, Office of Sustainable Development.  Country Task Managers from USAID Missions will provide monitoring and evaluation oversight.

D.3.	Geographic Scope

As a regional program, SUWASA will demonstrate successful interventions for water and sanitation, improve African organizations capacity to implement such, and complement national efforts through a regional platform.   This contract will support at least fifteen reform activities in sub-Saharan Africa in at least five countries.  Priority countries include Angola, Benin, Burundi, Djibouti, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.  

 
D.4.	Tasks

Under SUWASA, the Contractor will identify, promote, and transfer good practice in water utility reform and governance within sub-Saharan Africa in order to improve and expand the delivery of water and sanitation services in urban, peri-urban or rural settings.  Working through local partners and networks, the Contractor will support reform initiatives in at least five of the priority water countries.  The Contractor will provide assistance directly to at least fifteen utilities. The results of these reform initiatives will be documented and shared with national governments, local governments, and other utilities through existing regional associations.  At the end of the four years, the Contractor will develop a range of models that can be adapted and implemented in places committed to reform.

As a specific priority, SUWASA will demonstrate how utility reform and improvements in governance and management link with and complement efforts to access innovative financing for new investments in infrastructure.  The Contractor will assist with the development of water revolving funds in countries that have a credible plan for establishing such a fund in order to demonstrate the viability of market-based financing in sub-Saharan Africa.  In addition, priority will be given to developing effective models for expanding and improving services for the poor. Another priority for the activity will be to develop and implement partnerships with the private sector to advance SUWASA objectives.

Task 1:	Training/Socialization

The Contractor will organize up to three introductory regional training sessions to introduce the SUWASA activity and the key concepts promoted by the program.  These training sessions will be completed within six (6) months after award date or as approved by the CTO.  The purpose of these training sessions is not only to raise general awareness and understanding of key innovations in water and sanitation utility governance and reform including Environmental Impact Assessments, but to identify partners for the reform activities.  The regional training sessions will include representatives from the utility sector, central or local government, USAID, other donors, and associations of water utilities.  The training session will (1) introduce potential partners to the types of reforms and approaches that are being successfully applied in sub-Saharan Africa (see illustrative list below); (2) explain the objective and general approach of the SUWASA activity; and (3) identify initial partners.  

The Contractor will work with USAID to identify and invite participants.  Attendees will include senior managers from reforming utilities in the priority countries, representatives from associations such as the African Water Utility Operators Partnership (AWUOP), regulators, and  central and/or local government officials.  As establishing strategic partnerships will be important to the success of the program, invitees should also include USAID mission staff, donors working in the water sector, and other potential partners.  

It is expected that up to three regional events will be necessary to facilitate maximum participation.  The USAID CTO will provide final approval for the location and timing of each event.  The Contractor will work closely with the bilateral USAID mission, as appropriate, on issues related to the implementation of the events. 

Examples of potential reform initiatives include:

	Mozambique:  Water utility corporate governance reform and regulation:  The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will be investing in smaller utilities with weak corporate governance and management.  In return, the Mozambique Water Regulation Agency (CRA), a leading water regulatory agency in sub-Saharan Africa, has asked for assistance from USAID to address reforms in corporate governance of water utilities to complement the MCC program.
	Nigeria:  Introduction of pro-poor service delivery models in Lagos; support for a lease contract in Plateau State or another state that commits to reform. 
	Zambia: Working with individual utilities that are introducing reforms driven by the well-established nationwide water utility regulatory framework.
	The World Bank has also identified Angola, Ethiopia, and Madagascar as places where commitment to utility and/or regulation reform is strong and where a USG investment could make a significant contribution.  Output-based Aid (OBA) activities expanding service to the poor in Kampala.
	Uganda: National Water & Sanitation Corporation (NWSC) has been successful in turning around the national utility and now serves as a model for other countries.  NWCS is already providing technical assistance to utilities in Zambia and elsewhere. The SUWASA activity may provide assistance in establishing a water investment revolving fund to lend to the countrys private water operators. 

Task 2:	Reform Work Plans

Based on the outcomes of the training sessions, the Contractor will refine the list of potential partners for participation in SUWASA along with a brief description of opportunities.  The list will be submitted to USAID for approval along with the criteria utilized to prioritize the potential partners.  USAID will have final approval of the short-list of partners to be engaged in the reform activities.  The USAID Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) will take the lead in obtaining USAID Mission approval for the activities at the country level.

For each reform activity, the Contractor will negotiate a Reform Work Plan (RWP) which details the commitments of all parties over the period of the reform support activities.  Each of the RWPs should cover a period of no more than twenty-four months and will clearly delineate the assistance to be provided under SUWASA, including training and consulting services and any grants for capital expenditures or commodities.  

The responsibilities and commitment of the participating water utility, water regulator, national or local government will also be laid out in the Reform Work Plan, including a signature block for the participant to indicate their willingness to participate in the ways outlined in the RWP.  Therefore in additional identifying potential USAID support, the , the RWP should clearly state the commitments of the reforming partner.  In particular, the RWP shall state the staff resources available to implement the reform activity, commitment to continuing and expanding the activities, other budget resources contributing to the successful implementation of the activity.

The Contractor will work closely with the relevant bilateral USAID Mission to keep them informed of the RWP development and to ensure that activities are complementary to any bilateral programs on water and sanitation.  Bilateral Missions will also be asked to approve the RWPs for activities in their respective countries.

Task 3:	Technical Assistance for Reform Activities

Based on the individual Reform Work Plan for each reform activity, SUWASA will provide technical assistance and support to carry out specific reforms that will lead to improvements in management and in-service delivery.  The time frame for the reform activities may vary but will be approximately twenty four months of assistance.  Reform activities might include the introduction of improved corporate governance procedures and mechanisms such as new board composition, bonus schemes for management and staff, and corporate bylaws that require commercialized operation, environmental assessments, support for corporatization and design of operating contracts, design of staff incentive schemes, and development of services for poor customers that are commercially viable.  At the sector level, the development of a non-leveraged water revolving fund is an example of an innovation in finance.

In addition to providing direct technical assistance and training through short and long-term advisors, the SUWASA Contractor will facilitate technical twinning partnerships and internships for technical staff as well as policy-makers as a way to transfer knowledge and best practice.  There are examples of well-run utilities in the region and these institutions should serve as resources to others. For example, staff from utilities in Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya might carry out internships with utilities in Uganda or South Africa.  Peer-to-peer learning opportunities that include hands-on job training experiences and using practitioners to provide technical assistance can be a powerful tool.  This also builds local capacity to provide on-going technical support beyond the life of the activity.  The Contractor will work with AfWA, AWUOP and other regional associations to implement these activities as this kind of best practice transfer program could be developed in to a viable member service thereby increasing the likelihood of sustaining the results of the SUWASA activity.

Task 4: Sub-Grants Program for Demonstration Projects and Slum/Peri-Urban Services Expansion (Grants Under Contract)

The SUWASA Activity will be responsible for managing a sub-grant component (not to exceed $3.25 million over the first four year base period) to support the reform activities through demonstration projects and expansion of service connections in slum and peri-urban areas.  On a limited basis, pilot activities shall incorporate limited support (up to $250,000) for capital expenditures to demonstrate the viability of expanding services to the poor, or to support small capital investment requirements associated with reforms.  Examples might include establishing community standpipes for slum communities in combination with community education and awareness programs to improve hygiene practices and to establish a Water User Group to maintain the community resources and to engage with the utility. Capital grants can also be provided for specific reform-related expenditures, such as purchase of new billing and collection systems, bulk meters, and metering systems that are being tested on a trial basis.  Environmental Assessments must be completed before committing to support of capital expenditure projects.

The Contractor shall develop uniform criteria for reviewing and awarding grants including Environmental Impact Assessments.  The Contractor will consult with USAID to approve and finalize the criteria for grants prior to discussing this option with reform partners and development of the Reform Work Plans.  The Contractor is required to submit a Grants Manual to the CTO and Contracting Officer for approval prior to any grants being issued.

Task 5:   Provision of Commodities to Support Implementation of Reforms

The Contractor will procure commodities that will be used to implement reforms in specific utilities. The commodities will be provided under a grant agreement with a local, regional or national government agency responsible for water and sanitation services. Types of commodities will include meters, billing and collection systems and information technology for analyzing and optimizing hydraulic operations, leak detection equipment, and materials for establishing sectorized and zonal management systems. The Contractor will ensure that the commodities provided by the project are specifically related to implementation of reform activities, and that they are actually used for these purposes. 	

Task 6: Showcase Results

Throughout the activity, the SUWASA Contractor will carefully monitor and document implementation of the reform activities and the final results.  At the conclusion of the reform activities, the Contractor will organize a regional event for water utility operators, national government officials, etc. to give successful reformers an opportunity to showcase their challenges and successes.  The showcase event should be coordinated with one of the existing regional associations.  The purpose of the final showcase event should not be limited to sharing best practice but should focus on the transfer of that knowledge and good practices to other countries and utilities.  The closing event should also allocate time for developing an action plan of next steps for local partners to implement with their own resources to continue the work initiated under the program.

E.	DELIVERABLES

ANNEX 1

1.	The Challenge

Sub-Saharan Africa is struggling to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) target of halving the proportion of people living without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015.  The region is experiencing the highest rates of urban growth in the world with most of that growth occurring in slums with no access to basic environmental services.  A burgeoning population, limited financing and capacity at the national and local levels combined with conflicts throughout the region are stressing already weak systems.  Rather than increasing access, in many countries per capita water access is declining  For example, a study conducted by UN HABITAT noted that in many urban sites in East Africa over the past 30 years, water supplies have actually become significantly worse over the past 30 years due to lack of maintenance and deterioration of infrastructure.  The UN HABITAT report went on to stress the failure of institutions that provide water in towns and cities in Africa, stating: 

	deficiencies in water and sanitation provision in cities are often as much a result of inadequacies in the institutions with responsibilities for providing water and sanitation, and governance structures within which they operate, as a lack of funds. This makes the task of improving provision more difficult. This helps explain why progress has been so limited. 

Although some countries in sub-Saharan Africa have made great strides in developing the necessary policy and governance frameworks to improve the performance of basic water and sanitation services, the reforms are just beginning to show larger scale increases in access to improved services. Experience is showing that countries that adopt well designed water utility reform plans are substantially improving access to services, financial capacity to sustain and expand services, and the quality of services provided. Examples such as Uganda, Cote dIvoire, Senegal and Zambia show that reform works.  However, in the majority of sub-Saharan countries, broad utility reforms that lead to sustainable services for the poor are either just beginning, or have yet to start. In addition, local capacity to plan for and manage services is very limited; without strong support from the national level, local government institutions often cannot fulfill their obligations to deliver services.   

In urban and peri-urban areas, water utilities generally serve the higher income sections of the town or city, leaving poor and marginalized populations unserved.  The result is that the poor generally pay high prices to vendors and other informal networks compared to the tariffs charged by utilities for piped water.   Expanding water services to poor urban communities can be cost effective and can have considerable impact on achieving the MDG targets. However, it is necessary in most countries to undertake utility reforms to expand services into poor areas on a sustainable basis. 

Improving sanitation services is even more challenging. Where water utilities face financial difficulties in providing and maintaining a service for which there is relatively high willingness to pay, there rarely exists the ability to systematically improve network sanitation services. The local governments typically mandated with providing such services struggle with a relatively low level of household willingness to pay for sanitation services and the expensive capital and maintenance costs associated with traditional waterborne sewage systems. Even the ability to build and maintain alternative technologies lower cost technologies, like community latrines, is often beyond their capacity.

A final issue that remains a serious constraint is the limited level of financing available for investment to improve or expand service delivery.  Cash-strapped central governments do not have sufficient resources available in the national budget to meet the capital investment needs nor do donors such as the World Bank or Africa Development Bank.  Reliance on limited capital grants or concessional lending creates dependency and is a disincentive to performance.  With weakly managed utilities and distortions to the market created by the prevalence of grants and donor lending, domestic capital markets are under-developed and not providing much needed resources for the water sector. 

2.	Utility Reform and Governance

Poorly managed utilities are characterized by high levels of non-revenue water due to poorly managed and maintained systems, weak investment planning, non-commercial practices, limited consumer orientation, and insufficient attention to the poor.   The absence of good corporate governance and management means that utilities have limited or no access to new sources of capital financing and their ability to invest in even routine repairs is minimal, this leads to a cycle of decline and ever poorer levels of service.

The World Bank has recently issued several major studies, including cases from sub-Saharan Africa, that address characteristics of good water utilities; service models for the poor; innovative financing models; the challenge of financing sanitation; water pricing, regulation, and cost recovery; and the transition to bankability.  USAID has also conducted a number of studies recently that support similar conclusions, emphasizing the importance of corporate governance and utility reform.  The evidence is clear that bankrupt, poorly managed utilities rarely can serve poor consumers sustainably, while reformed utilities have shown dramatic ability to expand quality water and sanitation services to the poor. 

The combination of water sector reform and improvements of utility-level management and governance can turn this situation around.  While the a utilitys transition to good performance may take several years, the world wide conditions for good utility performance are well understood and are relevant to utilities in sub-Saharan Africa.  In addition, the building blocks for reform are generally known among African water sector personnel. What is needed is support for specific reforms. In many cases, the support that is needed is technical assistance and policy dialogue, not large amounts of new capital investment. In general, funds for capital rehabilitation, for installation of new, improved systems, and for expansion into poor neighborhoods can be obtained once donors see that real progress in reform is occurring. In addition, there are numerous examples of utilities that have first reformed, and due to the improvements, they become able to pay a significant part of their capital financing needs through internally generated earnings.  

The types of reforms that have been demonstrated to be successful in fixing troubled water and sanitation utilities include: 

	Corporatization and introduction of improved procedures and mechanisms for corporate governance; 
	Use of operating contracts between the utility and the public agency responsible for supervising water companies; 
	Introduction of incentives for employees that directly tie bonuses to performance improvements;
	Introduction of improved commercial systems, including metering and metered billing;
	Introduction of effective economic regulation; and 
	Models for delivering services to poor consumers that are financially sustainable and tailored to local needs.

There is a major opportunity to help reforming water and sanitation service providers introduce new service models for poor consumers.  In many cases, these sustainable service models for the poor require that the utility be able to charge customers a water tariff that is close or equal to the cost of delivering service.  In addition, it is often essential to allow the utility to establish new types of service connections, payment arrangements, and service norms.  However, it can be extremely challenging for utilities to broker such innovative arrangements with poor consumers.  To overcome these challenges, a growing number of water service providers have found ways to effectively partner with civil society organizations adept at mobilizing community participation and commitment to pay for services. Such partnerships also hold promise in supporting implementation of wide-scale sanitation improvements where technology selection and implementation needs to be tailored to specific community level demand.

Moving away from a strict reliance on donor funds or capital grants from the central government towards more market-based financing also requires that utilities are well managed. Simply put, bankrupt utilities are not viewed as attractive borrowers.  There are a variety of financing options that can serve bankable utilities, ranging from commercial loans, to the establishment of revolving funds, pooled financing or bonds.  National and sub-national governments need to utilize scarce government and donor resources more effectively and where possible access private sector resources.  Utility reform and governance lays the foundation not only for improved operations and financial viability but is a necessary first step to accessing the domestic capital markets. 

3.	Local Initiatives and Resources

There are a number of associations, initiatives, capacity building programs and capital investment projects in the region that can serve as partner organizations for the USAID SUWASA Project. These include the African Water Utility Operators Partnership, the African Water Association, the Water & Sanitation Program, and the International Water Association. In addition, several leading donor organizations, including the World Bank, WSP, UNDP, EU Water Initiative, and the African Council of Ministers Water Initiative have established a MDG Action Plan with specific plans for 16 sub-Saharan countries. The SUWASA project will work alongside these organizations and initiatives to identify and assist specific water utility reforms that are aimed at achieving the MDGs related to water and sanitation.  

For example, the African Water Association (AfWA) headquartered in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire aims to be a pan-African organization bringing together all utilities in Africa.  AfWA is a member organization which is successfully sustained by member dues.  To date, AfWA is most active in West Africa with some activity in the other regions.  Major activities include scientific committee meetings working on technical aspects of utility services; regional conferences and events; and, a website and monthly newsletter. 

The International Water Association (IWA), which is a global association, has strong membership participation through the East and Southern Africa (ESAR) regional association as well as from individual members in other parts of the continent.  IWA has been involved in developing training materials and supporting workshops related to water and sanitation utility reform and performance improvement with a strong emphasis on the development of Water Safety Plans. 

Another potential resource is the African Water Utility Operators Partnership (AWUOP), a joint program initiated by the Union of African Water Suppliers (UAWS), the Regional Centre for Low Cost Water and Sanitation (CREPA), and the Centre for Training, Research and Networking for Development (TREND). Launched in 1996 with the support of the World Bank, AWUOP aims to build a partnership among African water supply and sanitation utilities and other key sector institutions to create opportunities for information sharing and capacity building. AWUOP emphasizes the need for utility reform including promotion of regulatory frameworks, benchmarking of utilities, development of tools for better utility management and reduction of unaccounted for water and promoting utilities to engage in providing services to the urban poor as well as working with other secondary suppliers such as small scale providers. Organizations like this will be a mechanism for identification of specific reform initiatives that will be supported by the SUWASA project.

AHRQ is seeking potential sources from qualified small business firms under NAICS Code 541611 (size standard - $7 million) which can demonstrate the capacity to perform the required tasks in one or more of the domains described below.  AHRQ anticipates there will be multiple base contracts awarded in each domain with subsequent task orders (or delivery orders) to be awarded against the base contracts.  

In 2004, AHRQ established the NRC to advance the goals of DHHS and AHRQ for improving health care quality through the best and most effective use of health IT.  The NRC is a central national source of information and assistance to help our Nation embrace the power and efficiency of health information technology. The NRC provides direct technical assistance and consulting services to AHRQ and other federal projects involved in developing, testing, and using health IT applications and health IT implementations and use to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care.  In doing so, the NRC is helping to build the Nation's capacity across health care settings - large and small, urban and rural - for the effective use of health IT. In addition, the NRC serves as the link between the health care community at large and the researchers and experts who are on the front lines of health IT. 

As the main dissemination vehicle for lessons learned from AHRQ's health IT portfolio, the NRC encourages adoption of health IT by disseminating the latest tools, best practices, and research results from this unique real-world laboratory.

<DESC>Active/Passive Metal Detector

Introduction: DTRA is soliciting white papers to integrate selectable passive and non-passive metal detection technology into a single unit or instrument that is currently made or one that can be easily constructed. The instrument should be light weight (less than 2.5 lbs), one man portable (able to condense down and store in a 556 magazine type pocket on equipment) and able to detect very small amounts of ferrous and non ferrous materials. The sensitivity of the instrument should be enough to allow it to detect individual objects such as solid state electronic components and assembled circuit boards from single or multiple sources such as packages, bags, walls, floors, and different soil types with a minimum of 2-3 inch standoff. Detection and response should be quick and precise allowing the operator to quickly scan the object. This Sources Sought Announcement is under AIC CSC090012069.

Background: DTRAs mission is to safeguard America and its allies from weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high explosives CBRNE) by reducing the present threat and preparing for the future threat.  

Services: The proposal should include discussions using only proven active and passive detector technologies such as Electro-Magnetic Induction (EMI); Magnetometers; Gradiometers; and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). Unproven, experimental, or theoretical search technologies will not be considered. The discussion should include only the technologies that would be required to search, detect and locate ferrous and non-ferrous metallic materials. 
The instrument should be a design that is capable of penetrating soft materials (i.e.  hay stacks, between flour/rice bags) smoothly, rugged enough to use as a probe through loosely packed soils or materials, and capable of sweeping uneven or grown over terrain.  Instrumentation and user interface controls should be located in the same location as the handle or grip. The instrument may be used while standing fully upright, kneeling, low crawling or in a physical security mode to search for metal objects.  The instrument should be capable of varying lengths from 48 inches (fully extended) to 8 inches (collapsed).   The instrument must be capable of full operation while fully extended or collapsed or at any point in between.  The total dimensions collapsed cannot exceed 8 inches long x 3 inches wide x 2 inches deep.  The handle should conform to the instrument and should not extend or protrude off of the instrument when collapsed.  The instrument should be ruggedized, capable of operating in all weather and all terrains.
The controls should be simple on/off selectable, thumb wheel type or push button, easily used with one hand and configured to respond to only positive intended commands. The instrument should have a selectable on/off intensity switch for controlling a visual indicator as well as controlling the sensitivity settings for the passive and active detectors. The visual indicator should consist of intensity indicator lights and should be Infra-red selectable.  A selectable on/off audible indicator should be included and an output must be available for a user headset. Controls should also allow the operator to select between active and passive search modes or a combination of the two modes. 
 The instrument should be capable of one handed operation. Overall weight should be 1.5 - 2.5 lbs; counterbalanced or with wrist or forearm support to facilitate use when fully extended. The design must use a commercial off the shelf power supply such as a 3 volt lithium battery. The power supply must be integrated into the instrument.  The instrument should be capable of continuous operation for 4 hours between 30-90 degrees F. 
Overall use is for the instrument to function much like a standard metal detector but incorporating technologies in order to detect all metals, not necessarily associated with ordnance or landmines and to provide a smaller, lighter, more flexible instrument that will be capable in a diverse range of operating environments.  The total time of the effort must be completed in 18 months or less.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, in collaboration with Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), is pursuing novel Chemical and Biological (CB) protective garment, boot and glove materials; closures; and interfaces for integration into a CB protective combat ensemble that will reduce overall system level thermal burden/stress associated with current CB protective ensembles and will seamlessly integrate with all Warfighter combat ensemble components to include future head-gear concepts.  Any CB protective material technologies that may offer  improved  thermal performance (as defined by im and clo measurements) are of interest and may include self-detoxifying materials, perm-selective materials, selectively permeable materials, carbon-based technologies, and other novel technologies.  Ultimately, a flame resistant combat uniform material that affords CB protection without increasing heat stress on the wearer is desirable.<BR><BR>The Government plans to conduct a technology demonstration in FY10 assessing the integration of novel CB protective garment materials, CB sensors, respiratory and ocular protection technologies into a Solider as a System-Ground (SaaS-G) concept ensemble. Design concepts, integrated with these CB technologies, will be assessed for improvements to overall mission performance to include physiological/thermal burden, overall human performance (cognitive/physical), mobility, weight/bulk, tactility/dexterity, situational awareness and integration with SaaS-G components.  Chemical and Biological Protection will be considered across a range of challenge levels ranging from 3-10 grams/m2 liquid and 500-5000 mg-min/m3 vapor and aerosol. However, concepts must demonstrate modularity/flexibility to allow for increase or decrease in protection based on the threat level.  Trade-space will be assessed between performance characteristics, as well as Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF impacts/trades) and cost.<BR>This Request for Information should be considered an open call for any materials, closures and interfaces regardless of maturity level, that have the possibility of providing CB protection without raising the thermal burden on the Warfighter while wearing a combat load.  The final goal is a material that possesses physical and performance characteristics similar to that of the Flame Resistant (FR) Army Combat Uniform (ACU), but in addition provides a level of inherent CB protection that may range from 3-10 g/m2.  It is highly desired that the technology break new ground for reducing the physiological burden of CB protection by using thermal performance as the independent variable in attaining the final goal described.  <BR>Garment materials, glove materials and boot materials that provide between 8-24 hours of continuous protection from a liquid challenge ranging between 3 g/m2 to10 g/m2 of the chemical agents HD, GD and VX; a vapor challenge at 500-5000 mg-min/m3 for HD, TGD and VX; a aerosol challenge at 500-5000 mg-min/m3 for HD, TGD, and VX; and enhanced thermal performance (im/clo similar to that of the FR ACU), are all of interest.  Other desired performance characteristics may be air permeable; high Moisture Vapor Transfer Rate (MVTR); abrasion, flame resistance, water and oil resistant; self-decontaminable; durable; lightweight; etc.  The characteristics listed above for garment, boot and glove materials/end items indicate a desired performance level and are not intended to eliminate a single technology or material from submission or evaluation.<BR><BR>Respondents shall complete a separate questionnaire located at https://www3.natick.army.mil/upcoming.cfm and submit with their response. <BR><BR>Items or information submitted for garment materials should be clearly identified on the information packet as Garment Material.  Items or information submitted for glove materials should be clearly identified on the information packet as Glove or Glove Material.  Items or information submitted for boot materials should be clearly identified on the information packet as Boot or Boot Material.  Items or information submitted for closures should be clearly identified on the information packet as Closure.  Items or information submitted for interfaces should be clearly identified on the information packet as Interface.  Please submit responses by 31 December 2008 to the point of contact identified below.<BR><BR>Respondents should describe their products and technology, identify the level and type of CB protection offered (identify CW/BW agents and/or TICs addressed, challenge levels and protection time, environmental effects, operational contaminant effects, etc.).  Respondents should, include available test results (including test method utilized) which demonstrates the trade offs above current users/product applications, status of manufacturing and production, any unique or proprietary construction requirements related to the products and cost.  Information for submission should include, but is not limited to, technical testing information (e.g. physical properties, performance characteristics, test methodology (e.g. TOP 8-2-501, ASTM,NFPA 701)), available test results for CB performance, certification/compliance, description of how the material will be used in its intended end item(i.e. garment, boot, or glove), if configuration is important to the performance of the material, relevant company background/ experience and any other information that the company believes demonstrates the value, performance and capabilities of their product(s) and the ability to meet the aforementioned desired performance.  For developmental products, include estimates of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Level. <BR><BR>Companies may be contacted for additional information or a request to submit samples for further consideration in the demonstration.  The government will assess submissions and may choose to perform independent physical and other testing to determine the best performing material / solution available.  Companies may request testing results regarding only their own materials.  <BR><BR>This RFI is solely for demonstration purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MARKET SURVEY

TRANSPORTATION OF CARGO TO/FROM NORTHERN EUROPE OR CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES (CONUS) TO/FROM VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN

The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is conducting a market survey on industry capabilities and potential sources for inter-theater surface transportation of military cargo to/from various destinations in Afghanistan utilizing two possible options.  The first option is to move cargo between Northern Europe and various destinations in Afghanistan through Caucus and Central Asia.  The second option is to move cargo between CONUS and Afghanistan through Asia and Central Asia.  In addition to the options above, the Government is also looking for other possible innovative routing and intermodal solutions which may include air transportation.  Maps with detailed routing must be included in every option presented.  Teaming for solutions is permitted.  The Cargo Preference Act and Fly America Act will apply.  There is no solicitation package at this time.
 
This market research is designed to solicit ideas and opinions from experts in the field pertaining to the potential follow-on competition and to develop the solicitation while determining the level of interested sources.  The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time.  This announcement is only an expression of interest and does not commit the Government to pay for any response preparation cost.  The government will not make an award on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information synopsis.  Copies of information submitted by interested parties will be reproduced and submitted to a USTRANSCOM team for review and will be used to develop the requirement.

USTRANSCOM is seeking information on industry capabilities and potential sources that can provide reliable and secure Time Definite Delivery, Security, In-transit visibility and end to end management of containerized and break bulk military cargo from/to Northern Europe in option one, or CONUS in the second option, to/from various locations in Afghanistan.  The majority of cargo deliveries in Afghanistan will be to Bagram and Kandahar airfields.  The military cargo may consist of CLASS I (food and water), CLASS II (General Supplies), CLASS III Package (oils/lubricants), CLASS IV (Construction Materials), CLASS VI (AAFES Supplies), CLASS VII (Major End Items), CLASS VIII (Medical Supplies), CLASS IX (Repair Parts), or CLASS X (non-military goods such as humanitarian supplies).  The current operating environment presents significant risk.  This includes strikes, border delays, accidents, and pilferage.  Within Afghanistan this risk also includes attacks and armed hijackings.  Shipments from/to the origin to/from the various destinations in the region could eventually amount to approximately 30,000 twenty foot equivalent units (TEU) and 21,500 forty foot equivalent units (FEU) per year.  Approximately 85 percent are dry containers and 15 percent are refrigerated (reefers).  Additionally, break-bulk cargo could eventually reach approximately 20,000 Stons.

USTRANSCOM encourages all interested companies to submit a detailed response that specifically outlines your companys ability to meet these requirements:

1.	Accept cargo at origin, either in Europe, CONUS or Afghanistan, on behalf of the Government and deliver to the final destination.  The Government requires transit times of between 30 to 45 days from acceptance at the origin to the various locations within Afghanistan.
2.	Establish and operate up to six container transload points in AFG.
3.	Retrograde material back to Europe or CONUS on return trip.
4.	Ensure cargo loss rate is less than one percent (to include losses due to pilferage, accident, spoilage, attacks and acts of God).
5.	Provide real-time In-transit Visibility (ITV) compatible with command and control applications on cargo location and provide full access to the shipper and other Government employees designated by the contracting officer.
6.	Deliver cargo by the required delivery date (RDD) on a minimum of 90 percent of shipments.
7.	Provide direct delivery to Forward Operating Bases if required.
8.	Initiate process improvements and other value added services.
9.	Provide end to end management with customized information management reports related to delivery time, delivery reliability, shipment volume and other criteria that characterize and provide performance based views.
10.	Handle substantial increases in shipments (surge requirements) as needed for wartime and other contingencies.
11.	Provide security for cargo from origin to destination.

Market Survey:
USTRANSCOM is asking for industry input and comment on this requirement to include commercial best practices and logistics/transportation management capabilities.  All interested parties (to include potential prime contractors, subcontractors, or teams) are strongly encouraged to submit a response to this RFI.  Responses should be concise and include the following:

1.	A comprehensive explanation of  innovative alternatives your company may have to the two options TRANSCOM is currently considering (as referenced in the first paragraph of this RFI).
2.	Is your company capable of performing the services described and would you be interested in submitting a proposal for the services identified above?
3.	If not, why?  If so, briefly describe your capabilities.
4.	What are the recommended commercial practices from a contract perspective for these types of services?
5.	What are the methods/metrics the commercial industry uses for monitoring performance?
6.	What flexibility in a performance work statement must the respondent have in order to propose the most effective and economical transportation operation?
7.	What data from the US Government would be required for a responsible response to develop a proposal to manage and operate inbound and outbound transportation requirements?
8.	Describe the risks/associated with this effort.  How can the risks be mitigated?
9.	How the company would provide ITV, security, and process claims for lost, damaged or stolen freight.
10.	Description of companys teaming and relationship management with sub-contractors along with your companys understanding of the challenges and risks of operating successfully in the region.
11.	Specific identification of any limits to companys capabilities.
12.	Your companys experience in providing the services described above and its experience with an operation similar in size and scope to that described above.  Include:  The largest projects the company managed either as a prime or subcontractor including shipping volumes, total revenue, performance goal results, and other metrics with regards to pilferage, losses, percentage of RDD met, and how long the relationship lasted.
13.	Your companys recommended commercial pricing structure for the operation described above.  Break down pricing to normal delivery, retrograde of empties and retrograde of material out of Afghanistan separately.  What are the major cost drivers?
14.	Recommended incentive provisions to motivate performance that will meet or exceed the goals of this effort (for example RDD, cargo loss metrics, ITV).
15.	What limiting factors, if any, exist?
16.	Are there any other concerns/comments or recommendations?

<DESC><p>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) invites firms that provide commercial satellite communications services to participate in a market survey on expansion of the SILK Project in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The SILK Project is an outreach effort to countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia that links, by means of the internet, selected scientific and educational institutions in order to provide a network in which scientific, intellectual, and cultural information may be exchanged.</p>
<p>The current medium for providing the internet connectivity is by satellite communication. As fiber optic cable is gradually introduced in the countries,&nbsp;the need for satellite connectivity will be reduced. It is anticipated that Afghanistan, however, will continue to require satellite service provided by the SILK Project for the foreseeable future. It is expected that NATO will not only continue the current project in Afghanistan but will significantly expand the level and area of service provided.</p>
<p>The attached prospective Statement of Requirements provides the details of the anticipated requirements for SILK expansion in Afghanistan. The effort is not necessarily linked to the existing SILK-2 contract for the Caucasus and Central Asian republics and should be regarded as a stand-alone effort. The document sets forth the technical parameters and the projected technical requirements and planning.</p>
<p>If the project is approved by the NATO Science for Peace and Security Committee, it is anticipated that the agreed final requirements would form the basis of an international competitive bidding procedure that would begin in early 2009.</p>
<p>It is stressed that the current document serves as NC3A's initial statement of the requirements and one possible technical solution. Firms responding to the market survey are free to suggest alternative approaches that&nbsp;best fit the circumstances and the requirements.</p>
<p>NC3A asks that interested firms provide comments and concerns regarding the attached Statement of Requirements, suggest any alternative approaches, and provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) price estimate for implementation, no later than <strong>27 October 2008</strong>. This deadline is necessary in order to obtain sufficient information for NC3A to advise the Science for Peace and Security Committee of the findings in November 2008. Firms may reply in any level of detail they so choose.</p>
<p>Firms are advised that no information provided is considered binding as an offer in terms of any future solicitation. Likewise, NC3A is not considered bound to follow with a formal solicitation or, if a formal solicitation is issued, to conform to the requirements of the attached Statement of Requirements.</p>
<p>NC3A bears no liability for the costs of preparation of the submission by firms that elect to do so. All information will be held by NC3A as Commercial-in-Confidence Business Sensitive.</p>
<p>All market survey submissions should be addressed Mr. Philip M. Chulick, Principal Contracting Officer, at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Philip.chulick@nc3a.nato.int</span> or +32 2 707 8308.</p>

 HSAR 3052.20970 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

*************************************************************************
Amendment 1 to FAA Posting ID #7109
Background:The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a safety-critical system that provides accurate precise navigation and landing guidance to equipped aircraft in any weather. The WAAS augments the United States Government (USG) Global Positioning System (GPS) and Standard Positioning Service (SPS). The primary mission of the WAAS is to provide a means for air navigation during all phases of flight in the National Airspace System (NAS); departure, en route and approach.  The WAAS augments GPS with the following three services: a ranging function, which improves availability and reliability; differential GPS corrections, which improve accuracy; and integrity monitoring, which improves safety.  
The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) is a ground-based augmentation to GPS that focuses its service on the airport area (approximately a 20-30 mile radius) for precision approach, departure procedures and terminal area operations. It broadcasts its correction message via a very high frequency (VHF) radio data link from a ground-based transmitter. LAAS will yield the extremely high accuracy, availability, and integrity necessary for Category I, II, and III precision approaches, and will provide the ability for flexible, curved approach paths. 
Scope of Work:In support of WAAS Phase III, significant technical refresh and reliability modifications will occur.  These modifications include development of an engineering model reference receiver that is L1C, L2C and L5 capable; improved WAAS processing for ionospheric estimation, scintillation robustness, and signal quality (evil waveform) monitoring; and incorporation of additional geostationary satellites and associated ground facilities.  
Integration of these enhancements must be seamless to WAAS users.  The system must continue to satisfy the stringent integrity requirements demanded of this safety of life navigation service. Integration of the new Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites into WAAS requires knowledge of signal generation simulation and modeling.  
To satisfy the above requirements, versatile systems engineering support as well as an in-depth understanding of the WAAS architecture and integrity design are required. The FAA requires senior systems engineering support for WAAS.  As well as, dedicated technical engineering support to GNSS modernization and LAAS.  The following tasks provide additional details on support activities sought by the FAA. It should be noted that inherent in these tasks are requirements for detailed knowledge of GPS receiver signal processing and design, an equivalent understanding of GNSS measurement processing and integrity algorithms,  and a mature GPS receiver and antenna test capability including access to an anechoic chamber.  Additionally, contractors shall have a demonstrated Radio Frequency (RF) interference survey, investigation capability and participation in forums on RF interference and GNSS modernization. 
An in-depth, thorough, comprehensive knowledge of WAAS and LAAS corrections generation, processing threads, integrity design, and an analytical support for WAAS modifications is required.
The ability to perform this work with a minimal to no learning curve is required. 
The FAA intends to award this contract as a Cost Plus-Fixed Fee type. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for these efforts are 541330, 541511, 541611, 541614, 561110, 541990 and 541712.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and the Naval Undergraduate Flight Training System (PMA-273) are soliciting proposals to procure on a competitive basis for the total maintenance, logistics, and technical support required to accomplish the repair and overhaul of the T-34 and T-44 aircraft landing gear and its components. This requirement is for T-34 and T-44 landing gear overhaul and repair services to ensure aircraft availability in support of the Chief of Naval Air Trainings (CNATRAs) primary and multi-engine pilot training program.  This acquisition will provide total maintenance, logistics, and technical support required to accomplish overhaul and repair of T-34 and T-44 aircraft landing gear and components, including labor, services, equipment, tools, facilities, technical data, and parts and material.

The T-34 and T-44 aircraft were procured as Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) aircraft certified under a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Type Certificate in the late 1970s.  The Government did not procure proprietary data or drawings for the T-34 and T-44 aircraft.  The T-34 and T-44 landing gear overhaul and repair is accomplished at an appropriately rated FAA Part 145 certified repair station.  Overhaul and repair is performed in accordance with the manufacturers established intervals and procedures.

The T-34 and T-44 Landing Gear Overhaul/Repair contract will be competed as a full and open competitive Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) requirements type contract with cost reimbursable contract line items for over and above parts and shipping.  Contract award is scheduled for January 2009 with a nine month base period and one option year.

Note: A full and open competition will be conducted using the BEST VALUE Source Selection approach to select the most advantages offer based on both non-price factors as well as price factors. The Government anticipates evaluating the offers based on technical, past performance, and price related factors. Anticipated award date is on or about January 2009 for firm-fixed price (FFP) and Cost Reimbursable type line items. 

The solicitation is available on the NAVAIR Home Page at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm under solicitation/RFP number N00019-08-R-0051.  Except as noted here, the Government will only release the solicitation/RFP, including any subsequent amendments, over the Internet.  Any amendment issued will be posted to this website and all vendors should regularly access the website to ensure they have all amendments. Failure to obtain any posted amendments and to respond to each of them prior to the date and time set for receipt of offers may render your offer nonresponsive.  No telephone requests for the solicitation will be accepted, no written requests will be accepted and no hard copies will be mailed. All proposals will be due by 3:00PM Eastern Standard Time on 14 November 2008.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request.  This request for information is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>1. SCOPE.<BR>Background: The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly.  The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed.  The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain potential solutions to identify ordinance buried in roadways comprised of both asphalt and compact earth.  The REF believes that Counter-Insurgency Operations (COIN) in Iraq and Afghanistan will require the use of ground penetrating radar (GPR) and a metal detector in order to accomplish these efforts.  Alternative solutions submitted by companies responding to this RFI will also be considered. <BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to Army Product Manager REF who will evaluate the information and feasibility of issuing a procurement action to resolve the stated problem.<BR><BR>2. REQUIREMENTS. <BR>The REF is looking for a system which can be integrated on any and/or all Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, or designated non standard vehicles.<BR><BR>The system should operate at a rate of advance of Threshold: 6 KPH    Objective: 12 KPH.<BR><BR>The detection performance should be: Threshold of 24in. and Objective distance of 48in. (measured from road surface to top of target) Pd greater than 90%, FAR less than 1/ Km.<BR><BR>The target set: Originally buried 155 mm and other artillery & mortar rounds as well as AT mines.  Identification of threats threshold: 6in. (to the top of the threat)  Objective: 14in. (to the top of the threat)<BR><BR>The clear coverage road width on a single pass (left to right direction): Threshold: 98in.  Objective: 288in.<BR><BR>Must have real-time display data.<BR><BR>Desired Delivery, Threshold: 9 months ARO Objective: 60 days ARO.  <BR><BR>3. DELIVERABLES<BR>Specific information on industry capability to produce a system that can meet the requirements identified in paragraph 2 above, or otherwise solve the problem of identifying ordinance buried in roadways comprised of both asphalt and compact earth in Iraq and Afghanistan.<BR><BR><BR><BR>This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the companys claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to satisfy one or more of the performance and technical objectives described above.  The white paper should discuss the companys ability to develop and or provide existing technologies to identify ordinance buried in roadways comprised of both asphalt and compact earth in Iraq and Afghanistan and should provide a ROM (rough order of magnitude) price and its anticipated delivery for the solution proposed.<BR><BR>The white paper should also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact.  The white paper should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the contracting officer at gregory.wagenknecht@us.army.mil.  The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research.  All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  The government will review RFI submissions as they are received.  The government reserves the right to close this RFI once they have received adequate response(s) to this RFI.<BR><BR>
