<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovation Technology Administration, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to issue a solicitation for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract in support of the National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) to acquire the services necessary to prepare and conduct NHTSA?s New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) Light Vehicle Dynamic Rollover Propensity Tests, collect test data results, and prepare reports describing vehicle responses during the dynamic rollover tests.  NHTSA recently issued a final rule known as the Stars on Cars that requires each new passenger automobile to be rated under the NCAP and to have those ratings displayed on a label on its new vehicle price sticker.  The results of these rollover tests will be used to supply consumers with comparative ratings of the dynamic rollover resistance of vehicles from model years 2008 through 2011.  In previous years, dynamic rollover tests were conducted on the Vehicle Dynamics Area (VDA) of the Transportation Research Center located in East Liberty, Ohio and on the test surface located at Dynamics Research Inc. located in Torrance, California.  These two surfaces are constructed to provide a uniform pavement friction and flat surface profile to a far greater degree than what is provided by ordinary highway techniques.  It?s mandatory that interested Contractors possess a test surface with the same uniform pavement friction and flat surface profile that will enable NHTSA?s dynamic rollover test to achieve the high level of test-to-test repeatability necessary for valid comparisons of vehicle performance.  It?s anticipated that a minimum of five (5) rollover maneuver tests will be conducted per year to a maximum of fifty (50) tests per year.  The period of performance for this contract will be four (4) years from the date of contract award.  The Government may consider making multiple contract awards.  Task orders will be issued after contract award and if multiple contract awards are made, then task orders will be competed.  The solicitation will be issued on or about June 21, 2007.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 days after the issuance of the solicitation.  The solicitation and related documents will be available in electronic format only on the Volpe Center Acquisition Division home page on the World Wide Web (www).  Paper copies of these documents will not be available.  These documents will be available in text format and will reside on a server which may be accessed using www browsers.  The www address is: http://www.volpe.dot.gov/procure/index.html.  Contractors desiring to receive a copy of the solicitation and any related documents must register at this site to receive electronic notification of the solicitation posting and availability for downloading.  Contractors are warned that when they register to receive solicitations, amendments, and other notices, the responsibility for providing the Government with an accurate and complete email address lies with the Contractor.  The Government will make no additional effort to deliver information when the system indicates that transmissions cannot be delivered to the email address provided.  For questions concerning this acquisition, contact the contracting official by email at Brickley@volpe.dot.gov.  ANY INQUIRIES VIA TELEPHONE WILL NOT BE HONORED.  NOTE: All Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive an award from a U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Agency.  Contractors may access the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov to register and/or obtain information about the registration process.  Additionally, the solicitation?s Representation and Certifications are no longer provided within the solicitation and must be submitted online through the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA).  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of the Representation and Certifications required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  Potential Contractors are highly encouraged to complete the online provisions within the Representation and Certifications at the earliest at https://orca.bpn.gov.

The applicable NAICS Code is 811310 with a size standard of $6,500,000.  This procurement will be accomplished using the policies and procedures of FAR Part 1, 5, 12, 15, 16, 17 and 19 and supplements and competed on an unrestricted basis.  The performance period is 01 Aug 07 through 31 Jul 08, with 4 one-year option periods.  Basis of award will be price and past performance with past performance being significantly more important than price. The Request For Proposal will be via the internet only at http://fbo.gov, where it is expected to be posted on or about 02 May 07.  A site visit is tentatively planned for 16 May 07.  No paper copies of this solicitation will be issued.  The closing date and time of submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package.  When the solicitation is posted, it is imperative interested parties review this site frequently for any updates/amendments.  By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that prospective awardees must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will render the offeror ineligible for award.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The following Clauses will also be in the Solicitation: 

PER FAR 52.232-18 AVAILABILTIY OF FUNDS (APR 1984)

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael Jackson, HQAMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL, 62225-5022, 618-229-0267, Fax 618-256-6668, email:  michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Navy intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Southern Research Institute, 2000 9th Avenue S, Birmingham, Alabama 35205-2708, for the following requirement.  This requirement is a follow-on to contract N00178-03-C-1021 which was awarded sole source to Southern Research Institute.  The requirement is for mechanical and thermal testing, and analysis of materials in support of advanced reentry applications for a base year and four one year options on a cost plus fixed fee (term) basis.  Testing and analysis efforts performed under this requirement include, but are not limited to, the following efforts:  Characterization of alternate/low-cost reentry body heatshield materials to include mechanical and thermal property measurements on Government furnished materials provided in the form of plates, cylinders, and frusta.  Characterization of alternate/low cost reentry body nosetip materials including mechanical and thermal property measurements on 3D carbon-carbon noset!  ip materials. The typical mechanical and thermal testing performed on nosetip and heatshield materials will be conducted at various temperatures, i.e. 70 degrees Fahrenheit, 1000 degrees Fahrenheit, 2000 degrees Fahrenheit, up to 5000 degrees Fahrenheit. Typical tests consists of axial and circumferential tension and compression tests, shear tests, conductivity, and thermal expansion tests in the axial, radial, and circumferential directions of the material. Other specialized tests may be performed when needed, such as, bending tests. The contractor shall perform non-destructive characterization of candidate materials on a selected basis.  The measurements to be used will be selected from the following:  visual inspection with documentation, alcohol wipe inspection, bulk gravimetric density, ultrasonic velocity, ultrasonic attenuation, spectral acoustics, radiography, radiometric density and open porosity.  Based upon the requirements of the test matrices, the contractor sh!  all prepare cutting plans to be used for removing specimen blanks from  the bulk shapes.  The contractor shall have a procedure for tracking all materials and specimens in the program.  The contractor shall support ground tests of reentry body heatshield and nosetip materials and substructures.  The tests will normally be in the AEDC high-pressure arcs, but other facilities such as the LHMEL high power laser and the NASA-Ames low-pressure arcs could be used.  The contractor shall support life extension studies of the SLBM Mk4 and Mk5 reentry body materials.  The contractor shall investigate thermal and mechanical properties of low erosion liners that can be used as inserts in rocket nozzles. These properties will enable one to do a design trade study to come up with an optimum nozzle design.  The contractor shall provide analysis support and phenomenological studies to include specialty tests to isolate and determine particular phenomena or behaviors that fall outside what is generally included in material characterization.  The contractor shal!  l perform fabrication of various flight test and specialty hardware from government furnished materials.  The contractor may be required to perform analyses or property measurements on other reentry body materials, such as antenna window materials.  Substantial documentation will be required.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) in Washington, DC intends to award a purchase order to Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors' Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) of New York, NY under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The purpose of this acquisition is to co-sponsor a follow-up workshop for investors and financial analysts to identify best practices for using  climate-risk disclosure information by companies to make investment and corporate governance decisions. This project provides outreach to targeted investor organizations, supports research of best practices in this area, and convenes a workshop for large institutional investors that have long been  a target audience for EPA's ENERGY STAR program. This workshop provides CPPD with the unique opportunity to access and engage in a dialogue with members of the institutional investor community.  Under this order, CDP will conduct follow-up research into issues and best practices involving the use  of climate risk disclosure information and how voluntary initiatives are viewed by investors. This research will be used in a workshop presented in September 2007 and will coincide with the release of data collected by CDP. EPA will receive recognition of ENERGY STAR and other CPPD-sponsored  voluntary programs, speaking opportunities at the workshop, contact lists, and a copy of the CDP 6 report and data.  NO SOLICIATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. CDP is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement as it is the only known organization that has successfully  managed a multinational, multi-year financial disclosure of climate risk initiative and provides an unbiased platform for dialogue concerning voluntary activities and climate risk. CDP provides public access to its data and has successfully secured the endorsement of over 155 major financial  organizations for their initiative to increase the disclosure of relevant information regarding greenhouse gas emissions and its potential impact on shareholder value. No other organization is known to provide access and exposure to large institutional investors interested in climate risk.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying EPA's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered. Reponses must be submitted in writing to Jami J. Rodgers, Contracting Officer, at  rodgers.jami@epa.gov A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 561920   NAICS Code: 151920 & 541620 The Office of Transportation and Air Quality, Transportation and Climate Division of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to  issue a sole source purchase order to the University of California, Davis for pre-conference planning services, conference logistics, registration, and receipt of publication of conference proceedings and articles for the Asilomar 2007 Transportation and Climate Policy, 11th Biennial Conference on  Transportation and Energy Policy and intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the University of California, Davis for access to the tools, data, and analysis developed from the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS-Davis) four-year multi-disciplinary research effort called the  Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways or STEPS program.  The conference will be held August 21-24, 2007 in Davis, California.  The conference will investigate three broad strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation: reducing motorized travel, shifting to less energy  intensive modes, and changing fuels and propulsion technologies.  The contractor will assist in developing the agenda, organize panels, acquire space for the conference, provide conference equipment, and provide conference registration to five EPA attendees.  The EPA will participate in the  organization of the conference including topics to be discussed, participate as a key speaker and panelist, receive electronic copies of all presentations made at the conference, a copy of any journal or journal issue that includes a version of the papers originally presented at the conference and  copy of prepared conference proceedings.  In regards to the STEPS program, the overarching objectives are to develop the theory, tools, and methods that allow for consistent and transparent comparisons of alternative energy and vehicle pathways and to apply these tools and methods in comparative  assessments of four general transportation energy pathways - hydrogen, biofuels, electricity, and fossil fuels.  The EPA will have access to electronic copies of the program's working papers and reports prior to publication, access to high-level invitation-only technical workshops and participation  in the STEPS advisory program to advise on the upcoming research program.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  The Asilomar Conference is a unique event, as no other conference is similarly organized to focus intensely on combining technology and fuels options for transportation and  climate policy.  It is an invitation only conference, held every two years, that brings together an inimitable combination of the best technical and policy minds in the nation, as well as international transportation specialists, in the focus area of vehicle emissions and their control.  As for the  STEPS program, UC-Davis is uniquely qualified to provide the in-depth analysis of energy pathways in the transportation sector, as it has access to the university's invaluable previous and ongoing transportation research on fuel cells and hydrogen pathways, making it particularly qualified to  provide detailed comparative assessments of sustainable transportation energy pathways in hydrogen, biofuels, electricity, and fossil fuels.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing  date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the contracting officer at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis, scientific and technical services with The Regents of the University of California, San Francisco, 1855 Berry Street; San Francisco, California 94107 regarding Molecular Epidemiology and Biology of Mammographic Density:  A Pilot Study to Evaluate Protocol Feasibility.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard is $6.5M.

The purpose of this requirement is to implement the Shepherd Method System for the Molecular Epidemiology and Biology of Mammorgraphic Density Pilot Study at the clinical site; the Fletcher Allen Hospital of the University of Vermont.  The Fletcher Allen Hospital-University of Vermont, is part of a national system of mammographic registries; the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.  

Contractor Requirements:  Contractor shall specify criteria for the construction of extremely precise density phantoms for each digital mammography instrument at Fletcher Allen, ensure proper installation of phantoms, hardware and software for data collection, and perform quality assurance monitoring and trouble shooting; to collect mammographic volume density measurements for women screened during the pilot study.  The contractor shall enroll 250 women between 40-65 years of age who are currently undergoing a clinically indicated breast biopsy prompted by a suspicious mammogram. These women represent about 1% of all women undergoing mammographic screening at Fletcher Allen Hospital.  

The Regents at the University of California-San Francisco, the laboratory of Dr. John Shepherd have developed a unique method for breast density measurement, including developing the design of breast density phantoms, supporting hardware and software and related quality assurance programs.  Particularly, the development of this novel technique achieves data generated with this density method and shows expected associations between risk factors and density and between density and breast cancer risk.  In addition, current projects within the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium study have instituted the Shepherd Method. Therefore, changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the current Breast Cancer Surveillance study and this pilot.  Maintaining consistency within the Consortium will provide opportunities to pool all scientific data for this study.  The laboratory at the University of California-San Francisco is the only source known to the NCI that has developed the Shepherd Method System that is required for this pilot study. 

Period of Performance shall be for twelve (12) months upon date of award.   

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM ET June 5, 2007.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Please reference solicitation number NCI-70062-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION FOR INTEGRATED ADVANCED COMPOSITE FIBER PLACEMENT PROGRAM

This is a Pre-Solicitation Synopsis; not a request for competitive proposals.  The purpose of this program is to expand the U.S. domestic industrial base capability in the production of large aerospace composite products employing automated and advanced fiber placement technologies.  The Title III Program Office, Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) intends to award an Assistance Instrument or a contract, as appropriate, on the basis of less than full and open competition for this requirement to Alliant Techsystems, Inc. (ATK), Freeport Center, Bldg C14, Clearfield, UT  84016.  Under the authority of Title III Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement to expand production capacity for large aerospace composite components employing automated and advanced fiber placement technologies.  This project requires a domestic, merchant-oriented composite supplier of large aerospace composite products.  This project further requires the manufacturer to possess an integrated design authority with experience in the design, construction and modification of fiber placement machinery.  The definition of domestic source as defined in the Defense Production Act of 1950 is as follows:  "A business concern that performs in the United States or Canada substantially all of the research and development, engineering, manufacturing, and production activities required of such business concern under a contract with the United States relating to a critical component or a critical technology item; and that procures from business concerns (described as above) substantially all of any components and assemblies required under a contract with the United States relating to a critical component or critical technology item."  For the purposes of this contract, the Government defines a merchant supplier as a production source which manufactures, supplies, and supports the use of its products by customers who represent end users independent of either internal or sister organizations.  In light of this requirement, a Title III merchant supplier of large aerospace composite components employing automated and advanced fiber placement technologies may not, as a matter of policy, place restrictions or limitations on which customers may buy or how they may subsequently use its products.  Additionally, for the purposes of this contract, the Government defines an integrated design authority as a one who as possesses the knowledge, expertise and prior experience within the entire large aerospace composite product value chain to include the fabrication of the necessary equipment through the actual production of large aerospace composite products.  The Integrated Advanced Composite Fiber Placement Program requires the fabrication and/or modification of large fiber placement equipment by the composite manufacturer in order to meet significant performance, cost and schedule efficiencies.   The use of an integrated design authority allows the company to accomplish the project goals within the project's funding and schedule constraints.  The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 18 months. A description of the task is as follows: 1) procure, modify, and install new automated composite fiber placement production machines to support capacity expansion, 2) deliver a detailed strategic business plan that formally assesses and verifies the military and commercial demand for automated composite fiber placement manufacturing for aerospace components, and 3) expand domestic production capability for automated composite fiber placement of aerospace components.  To meet the government's cost and schedule requirements the contractor must have: demonstrated leadership in the industry and have existing merchant-oriented large aerospace composite production capacity; demonstrated experience in design, development, inspection, and testing of high performance composite aircraft structures; demonstrated acceptance and credibility among aerospace customers; demonstrated business viability.  Automated composite manufacturing technology that is not based on advanced fiber placement (i.e. single and multiple tows) for large aerospace structures are not of interest to the government for this procurement.  Additional phases may be awarded based on defense requirements, anticipated demand, and availability of funding.  The government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR6.302-1(a)(1), "Only One Responsible Source" or "DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400(b)," based upon their domestic manufacturing activity, their experience as a large aerospace composite merchant industrial supplier providing leading edge technology, an assessment of their ability to meet project goals, and an assessment of the program risk to the Government.  Offerors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  This documentation shall specify the offeror's area of expertise and experience.  It shall include a demonstrated capability to build and/or modify automated fiber placement machines as well as to manufacture large aerospace composite products. The documentation shall demonstrate that the manufacturing capability is domestic as defined in the Defense Production Act, and that the company has a large aerospace composite product merchant supplier orientation.  In addition, the documentation shall include a listing of products and services currently offered as a large aerospace composite product merchant supplier, along with market share in each area, including military customers.    Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.  Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement.  Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. FOR: System Concepts Enabling Persistent Tracking and Identification for Combat (SCEPTIC) for a future call under the STROEB BAA-04-03-SNK. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/SNAR), Sensors Directorate, Sensor ATR Technology Division seeks potential sources for a sixty (60) month, $12M program to enhance the capabilities of the Advanced Recognition Center (ARC) facility located at WPAFB, OH and aid in the development and execution of various ARC evaluation activities.  It is expected that NATO participating companies and foreign firms will be excluded from participation in this effort.  Potential contractors and performing personnel must have security clearances at or above the Secret level, with potential to obtain Top Secret at a later date. Although the work will be conducted on WPAFB, contractors will need classified storage capability.

The ability to deny sanctuary to adversaries is limited by the capability of combat systems to acquire, track, identify and locate targets with sufficient persistence. The solution to this problem of detecting targets and continuously maintaining their identification and location requires a multi-faceted approach drawing from a variety of component technologies (e.g. Automatic Target Recognition/Cueing (ATR/ATC), target, tracking, registration, Sensor Fusion (SF), resource management, etc.). The ARC is a facility that emulates operational systems to permit the development, integration, demonstration, and transition of advanced technologies including automatic target recognition and multi-sensor fusion systems.  The ARC provides the ability to test component technologies in a system-level context and evaluate the incremental contribution of each element.

The effort entails the enhancement, optimization, demonstration, and evaluation of emerging systems and existing ARC assets. The contractor will be required to lead the assimilation of various software and hardware components into the ARC and aid in the development and execution of various evaluation activities.  The contractor will be required to work with the component developers and Government personnel to plan and implement interfaces to ensure coherent, effective system designs, and facilitate the integration of components into the ARC laboratory.   The contractor will be expected to maintain a disciplined, validated and efficient capability to exercise, analyze and evaluate system-of-systems solutions for the persistent and continuous ISR and tracking of targets by developing and integrating hardware and software components that update and enhance the demonstration and evaluation capabilities of the ARC facility.  The contractor should have past experience in Automatic Target Recognition/ Cueing (ATR/ATC), target, tracking, registration, Sensor Fusion (SF) resource management and related technologies.  The contractor should be familiar with SAR, HRR, HSI, GMTI, EO/IR, LIDAR and other sensor data used to facilitate persistent ISR, ATR and tracking capabilities.  The contractor must have personnel with the training and experience necessary to support the development and integration of the technologies discussed above.  The personnel will be required to support ARC lab systems including: networks, computer systems (mainly Sun, Sparc and PC systems), numerous operating systems (Linux, Solaris, Suse, WinXp, Red Hat, Debian, etc.), and a variety of exploitation, graphical display and utility software.   These personnel will be required to work on-site at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  It is expected that this effort shall require anywhere from 4 to 12 personnel based on workload. 

Businesses interested in this effort must respond with a complete capability/qualification package describing the company?s technical expertise, experience, personnel and facilities required to accomplish the work described above. 

The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541710. The small business size standard is 500 employees.  The purpose of this synopsis is to provide the Air Force technical team with the ability to determine capabilities of potential respondents.  The Air Force is contemplating a small business set aside based on the responses received.  If this acquisition is set aside for small business, the resulting contract will contain the clause FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting which requires (for services) that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.  Responses to this synopsis shall include a demonstration of the offeror's ability to perform at least 50 percent of the effort.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. This Sources Sought Notice is also issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. All businesses capable of providing these services are invited to respond. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Process Measurements Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Circuit Equipment Corporation, Mentor, Ohio, for the purchase of Radio Frequency (RF) Electronics replacement parts for several Ultrasonic Interferometer Manometers (UIMs).

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently utilizes four (4) ultrasonic interferometer manometers (UIMs) that require very specific RF signal processing.  The UIMs are one-of-a-kind devices that were developed and built at NIST to provide the United States with primary pressure standards.  Circuit Equipment Corporation (CEC) was contracted by NIST to design a prototype unit that met the NIST requirements.  NIST now owns and operates the UIM2004 Model RF Electronics Units that were built by CEC.  The purchase of replacement parts will enable NIST to operate its primary standards, serving as a backup if electrical components fail in the UIM2004 Units.  Therefore, the required equipment must be 100 percent compatible with the existing equipment.  Circuit Equipment Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the replacement parts that are required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by June 5, 2007, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>**** This notification hereby extends the deadline for submission of capability statements until May 24, 2007 4:00PM - Hawaii time).  

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses and 8(a) firms to conduct a threat assessment and pilot surveillance project for the newly established Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument (Monument)
On June 15, 2006, George Bush established Monument by Proclamation 8031 to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and lasting protection of the coral reef ecosystem and related marine resources and species of the region. These waters contain a large portion of all coral reefs found in the United States' jurisdiction and support more than 7,000 marine species, of which one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands chain.  The 1200-mile stretch of remote islands, atolls and reefs, is also the most remote archipelago in the world. 
  
Due to the size of the NWHI region, its remote location, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of management in the area, a threat assessment geared at the protection of the resources from the deep ocean to the land has not been conducted.  Characterizing and evaluating threats to the area coming from human activities such as illegal access, poaching, and unforeseen concerns arising from innovations in maritime technology will be an important part of this assessment.  Threats to the NWHI have been previously researched through the identification of a number of relevant data sets and an enforcement workshop geared at identifying solutions to remote enforcement issues in the area.  However, these have not been comprehensively evaluated or prioritized.  Therefore, the first task is to conduct a thorough threat assessment working with the co-trustee management agencies (NOAA, USFWS, and the State of Hawaii), the U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Defense, and relevant non-governmental entities.  This assessment will utilize to the extent necessary, public, commercial, classified and de-classified data to identify threats.  These threats should be prioritized by potential impact and probability of occurring, as well as geographically referenced.

The second task includes a review of the threat assessment with the management and enforcement agencies and an evaluation of existing assets for surveillance.  AIS, RadarSat imagery and sonar buoy arrays have been used by various agencies in the past, and potentially could be woven together for Monument management purposes in the future.  Identifying and evaluating these assets are important steps in creating an effective surveillance plan for the Monument.  The applicant should have DOD security clearance that would allow them to evaluate the utility of military assets and data sets for surveillance purposes.  

Many surveillance tools have been proposed for the Monument, including satellite surveillance, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), radar, AIS, SONAR arrays, etc.  However, they have not been evaluated against a comprehensive threat assessment, and compared by cost to benefit, and feasibility.  This analysis will be used to develop a prioritized list of short, medium and long-term surveillance solutions for the Monument.

A small-scale pilot demonstration project will be selected from the prioritized list of solutions discussed above.  This project should demonstrate the capacity to conduct remote surveillance in the Monument, and should not be dependent upon the construction of significant infrastructure.

The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS code 541990 with a size standard of $6.5 million.  

NOAA intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract for the work described above.  Firms responding to this market survey should provide only focused and pertinent information.  Offerors should include a description of significant collaboration and subcontracting that will be required to provide technically acceptable deliverables. Responding firms should provide their capability statement to Contract Specialist, Stephanie Garnett by email at Stephanie.m.garnett@noaa.gov no later than May 22, 2007. Capability Statements received after this date will not be considered.  All questions regarding this announcement should be addressed to the Contract Specialist at 808-944-2228.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael Jackson, HQAMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL, 62225-5022, 618-229-0267, Fax 618-256-6668, email:  michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

<DESC>This is modification 1 to the synopsis entitled Constellation Program Rescue and Recovery Methodologies, solicitation NNJ07ZTA005L, posted on May 2, 2007. You are notified that the following additional information is provided.  Requests for specific information regarding this RFI are currently not available.  At present, we have not determined any specific recovery architecture and intend to perform analyses based on information received from this RFI to determine future requirements (launch commit criteria, design criteria, etc...)  Two ground tracks are being considered. The first is a prograde trajectory departing KSC and proceeding along a 51.6 degree inclination to intercept the International Space Station. The ground track heads along the Eastern Seaboard up to Newfoundland and proceeds across the North Atlantic until reaching Ireland. This is the portion of the trajectory that is currently being studied for launch abort scenarios. The lunar trajectory will launch prograde from KSC to a 28.5 degree inclined orbit. The impact probability zones and a probability risk assessment are currently being investigated so information on these products are not available at this time. The results from these studies will be used in conjunction with the performance capabilities determined feasible for rescue and recovery operations to support a decision on what assets and/or capability to acquire.  The sea state launch commit criteria and sea state temperature impacts will be based around the responses to this RFI and the subsequent analyses. Schedule robustness in proving recovery architectures that conduct safe and reliable recoveries in higher sea states is of importance.  The specifics of the CEV are currently unknown, as such, we can not answer questions on survival equipment, buoyancy devices, and location and communication systems. It is recommended using Apollo as an analogy. Lifting hardware and attach points are to be decided, and will be derived from the chosen recovery methodology. Concerning Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Center, DoD ground rules state that the DoD will only provide capability that is unique.  (i.e. capability that NASA can not provide  or contract out to a commercial operation). We are currently investigating commercial capabilities to both complement the Coast Guard and also to seek cost effective ways to conduct recoveries specifically designed around the needs and the requirements unique to the CEV that mitigate the most risk to flight crew and ground operators.  This RFI is written to allow for varied methodologies and innovative concepts. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	 Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

These systems will include but not be limited to extensive experience in designing and developing real-time software under the HYDRA Architecture (Response Hydra, Bulletin Hydra, and Hydra Displays).  The proposed contractor, Bryan Geophysical, had implemented sophisticated seismic algorithms as HYDRA modules (Picker, Mwp, ML, MS, mb, Md and MT) for the USGS, ANSS project.  In addition to converting seismic algorithms to HYDRA modules, the proposed contractor has integrated the modules with the HYDRA architecture, including HYDRA Oracle DBMS programmatic access, configuration setting, error reporting, and integration with HYDRA GUIs.  Bryan Geophysical offers unique qualifications in the following areas that are considered essential to the requirement.  These unique qualifications include:  1) development of complex, sophisticated algorithm for the detection and processing of seismic events. 2) the experience, in-depth knowledge and qualifications of Dr. Carol Bryan to work with ANSS Senior Scientists to make critical improvements (analyze and enhance) to the ANSS station magnitude (Mwp, ML, MS, and mb) algorithms and MT module; 3) the development of a HYDRA module that automatically calculates the Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT); 4) the development of a beam forming code to locate earthquakes integrated with the HYDRA architecture.  Based on the information available at this time and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i) the government considers the item specified as a sole source from Bryan Geophysical, Vancouver, WA and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Concerns who feel that they can furnish the required services or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials that correspond to the required items to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  No solicitation document exists, therefore, requirements for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>Request for Information

Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement (DHS/ICE)

Full Service Case Management with Electronic Monitoring Devices    

SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE & REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.  It is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, DHS/ICE is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at responder expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information.  

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  Detention and Removal Operations, Alternatives to Detention Unit issues this Request for Information regarding full service case management, including electronic monitoring device installation and management, for supervision of non-United States citizens released from ICE custody into the community, who reside within a managed service area.  The goal of this RFI is to identify companies with readily available assets that can develop and operate a case management program that incorporates electronic monitoring technology, supervision services, and day reporting centers specific to the needs of DRO.
 
Contractors as well as Government personnel will review the responses to the RFI, unless the Responder specifically states that only the Government may view the submission.  Responders are advised that their submissions will receive greater consideration if the entire Government and Contractor team can assess its potential.

Background

DHS/ICE/DRO is the primary agency responsible for managing the administrative process to determine if non-US citizens may enter or remain in the United States, commonly known as removal proceedings.  ICE/DRO currently has more than 30,000 aliens in custody each day.  The majority of bed space is currently used for mandatory detention cases and the need to manage the remaining bed space is high.  
The Alternatives to Detention Unit within ICE/DRO supervises aliens who are not detained in DHS custody.  Congress has specifically earmarked funding for ATD programs as one way of addressing the multitude of issues associated with illegal immigration and detention space issues.  To improve ATD functions, the ATD unit must implement contractor case management tasks to focus on home and office visits, electronic monitoring programs, and the acquisition of travel documents for departure from the United States.  The DHS/ICE/DRO Alternatives to Detention Unit is currently exploring new case management services and supervision technologies that can encompass DRO requirements, yet remain flexible in the selection and frequency of those services.  Services shall include monitoring and reporting program compliance, including positive and negative program termination, absconder rates, appearance at immigration hearings, and length of time in program modules and provide a cost effective solution versus secure detention to provide progressive supervision for aliens who are released from ICE custody to the community.  The supervision technologies are to include, but are not limited to, non-removable bracelets using radio frequency (RF) or GPS (active and passive) that operate either over landline or cellular technology, and multi-lingual telephonic reporting.

<CONTACT>Lori Taylor 703-432-3023
<DESC>RFI --The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to augment their existing pool of technical and analytical services contractors for FY08.     This notice provides information for both current and new vendors wishing to participate in the Commands Commercial Enterprise Omnibus support services (CEOss) business model, established in August, 2002.       To date, $853+ million in task order awards have been accomplished ranging from $150K to $10 million.     CEOss is predicated upon Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.404, which authorizes agencies to issue Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with Federal Supply Service (FSS) contractors.     Thirty competitively awarded BPAs have been established with contractors using approved FSS schedules aligned along four (4) competency-based domains.     CEOss Open Season allows current prime contractors to reconstitute their existing teams to respond to anticipated FY08 Command requirements.     Additionally,     CEOss ass!  esses the need for new prime vendor awards in selected domains.     For FY08, openings are anticipated in the ALA and BA domains; unrestricted as to business size.     A preparatory workshop will be held for those firms interested in participating as new CEOss prime vendors on 12 June 2007, which will provide detailed information about Command requirements and RFI submission guidance.     Vendors are required to register for this workshop by submitting an email to the ACSS mailbox (acss@usmc.mil) NLT  05 June 2007.     Attendance is limited to two (2) representatives per company and attendance may be restricted due to space constraints.     CEOss Background Information:     The CEOss model relies exclusively on paperless, e-procurement transaction processes to compete all requirements among qualified domain prime vendors.     Individual Task Orders are competitively awarded to BPA contractors within these respective domains.       There is no maximum dollar limit on any tas!  k order, nor any minimum order amount assigned to the BPAs.     There  are four (4) domains within the CEOss model:     Specialty Engineering (SE), Business and Analytical (BA), Engineering and Scientific (ES), and Acquisition, Logistics and Administrative (ALA).     Vendors are required to identify the domain for which they would like to be considered for a prime BPA and only one submission per vendor is allowed.     To qualify for consideration in the ALA domain you must possess either a MOBIS (874), PES (871), or LOGWORLD (874 V) schedule.  To qualify in the BA domain, you must possess either a FABS (520), MOBIS (874), or Training Aids & Devices, Instructor-Led Training, Course Development, Test Administration (69) schedule.  Although vendors may have a prime BPA award in only one of the four domains, teaming and subcontracting relationships across the domains are unrestricted.  Instructions for new CEOss applicants:     To be considered for a CEOss prime BPA, interested vendors must submit the following information NLT  26 June 2007       A!   capabilities statement, limited to five (5) pages that identifies their firms capabilities within a domain of prime interest (ALA or BA) and a copy of their applicable GSA Schedule.     All material should be submitted on one (1) CD-ROM along with one (1) hard copy.     All business sizes will be considered for the ALA and BA domain openings.     However, based upon responses to this Request for Information (RFI), ACSS will determine if there is viability in pursuing restricted competition in one, or both, open domain(s).       Vendor submissions will be matched to domain (i.e., Command) requirements to establish a baseline that considers each firms pricing and technical capabilities within the existing pool of domain participants.     Vendors determined to offer the best "fit" within each domain, respective of price and services offered, will have the opportunity to respond to a formal solicitation that will be issued NLT 16 July 2007.     Responses will be due within t!  hirty (30) calendar days, inclusive of teaming arrangements.     Compe titive selection and award of BPAs is anticipated to occur NLT 31 August 2007.  RFI responses can be mailed to the following address:     COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM CODE ACSS, 2200 Lester St, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.     Responses submitted by FED-EX or UPS should be sent to the following address:     COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester St., Attn: Ms. Anita Norris, Code ACSS, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.   Only offerors who respond to this RFI and whose responses are determined to be the most highly rated will be provided a copy of the solicitation.  Instructions for existing CEOss Prime Vendors:     To reconstitute teaming relationships on your existing CEOss BPA, you are required to submit the following information:     An initial letter of intent (LOI), limited to two (2) pages, that discusses changes to team members, your ability to meet prescribed competition thresholds, discounting policy, and rationale for the new team to continue to support MCSC programs.     This must be !  submitted NLT 15 June 2007.     Revised proposals are due in accordance with the schedule on ACSS web site.     This must be accompanied by a copy of your selected team members GSA Schedule, and single, updated MS Excel spreadsheet of all of the GSA rates for your team from September 2007-September 2009 (including rates from existing GSA team schedules).     Do not submit this in .pdf format; it must be a single .xls file with one rate schedule per worksheet.     Existing BPAs will be bilaterally modified to update labor rates (Attachment C) and to incorporate any additional terms and conditions.     Additional guidance will be issued to incumbent vendors at a later date. All responses from existing CEOss Prime Vendors shall be submitted electronically to the following email address:     acss@usmc.mil.     Any questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted electronically to the ACSS Office at acss@usmc.mil.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV, Health Effects Lab Division and the Exposure Assessment Branch  intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Research Triangle Institute (RTI), 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research, NC 27709-2194 for preparing test slides for an ASTM International Inter-Laboratory Study to study the precision of asbestos counting rules in ASTM Standard D7200.  RTI has already taken non asbestos amphibole minerals and subjected them to communition by hydraulic press, sieving, and ball milling to achieve target fiber sizes defined by CDC/NIOSH.  RTI will do the same with five NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) asbestos reference materials. RTI will then combine these materials on filters and prepare test slides for the ILS. The test materials will be characterized by RTI using phase contrast microscopy (PCM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as specified and a report will be provided.

This is necessary in order to protect workers against asbestos and other regulated fibers, measurements are made of airborne fibers. These measurements are used in risk analysis and in setting control requirements. Potentially life-saving or expensive decisions should only be made on the basis of accurate exposure assessments. Continuous improvements to the sampling, analytical, and quality assurance aspects of fiber-counting are necessary.   In mining, asbestos fibers may be present alongside cleavage fragments of non-asbestiform amphiboles.  An ASTM Standard procedure has been developed to separately identify mineral cleavage fragments from other, potentially asbestiform, fibers in air samples. The methodology in the Standard must be checked by a round-robin test to determine the efficiency of the separation method. A supply of known non-asbestiform amphibole cleavage fragments of appropriate dimensions is required to prepare the test material.   The project objective is to improve the analysis of fibers, including asbestos, thereby contributing to more accurate hygienic decisions, and better allocation of resources.   The scope of work includes a base year and one option year. 

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to: Rebecca Mullenax, Reference 000HCCCD-2007-42984,  DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or E-mail rmullenax@cdc.gov  or fax to 304-285-6083.   

The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide the requirement.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract. Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov. 

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with New York Univsersity School of Medicine as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is soliciting ideas/solutions for a test asset for airborne open air optical sensor operation.  Information is desired for any of three options below: (1) Hosting a primary sensor for radiometrically calibrated data collection, (2), Hosting one or more guest sensors (primarily MDA interceptor seekers in a captive carry configuration), or (3), Both 1 and 2 above. This announcement is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  There is no solicitation available at this time and no funding has currently been allocated for award.  This notice is published for information purposes only and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract nor otherwise pay for information/items provided in response to this RFI.


Background:	MDA developed and operated the Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP) as a test asset supporting missile defense flight tests by performing optical data collection and hosting guest sensors in a captive carry configuration.  The WASP is a DC-10 aircraft modified for open air sensor viewing, and includes a primary sensor system (PSS) for radiometrically calibrated data collection.  The PSS is similar to MDA's High Altitude Observatory-II (HALO-II) sensor.  The WASP was removed from service for an indeterminate time period.  


MDA is soliciting options for a replacement or at least partial replacement of the WASP capability.  MDA requires an airborne platform for open air optical data collection at missile defense flight tests.  Both manned and unmanned aircraft options will be considered.  For the radiometrically calibrated data collection mission, MDA's PSS sensor is available, or the contractor may propose an alternative primary sensor; however the alternate sensor must meet or exceed the PSS sensor performance.  For the captive carry mission, the platform must have the ability to add or interchange guest sensors in a common configuration.  The contractor will propose, and the contractor and government will jointly establish, the common configuration.  The contractor performing the platform development activity will operate (provide mission support) and maintain the platform and data collection primary sensor (if included on the platform).  More than one platform may be considered depending on technical and programmatic considerations.


Top-level technical requirements:

1.	Possess the payload flexibility (weight, volume, power, thermal, environmental, communications, etc.) to accommodate the primary sensor and/or guest sensor(s) with open port viewing.
2.	Support MDA flight tests and events of interest at locations from the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean) with the corresponding deployment/logistics limitations, and communications requirements.

3.	Operate the aircraft at or above 40,000 feet altitude for data collection events for a minimum time of 4 hours.

4.	Operate the aircraft with an endurance of at least 6 hours.
5.	Provide real-time mission communications to uplink and downlink trajectory tracks and reference times, and downlink sensor imagery (images and video (256 kb/s minimum bandwidth)) over the entire operational range of MDA test events.
6.	Designed for a minimum of 10 years operational life (700 maximum endurance flights).


Should this request for information result in a request for proposal, potential offerors will have access via FedTeds to all MDA airborne test data, information, and documentation on the following MDA developed test assets for use in their evaluation/solution: the High Altitude Observatory (HALO) I & II test assets and the Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP).  All interface control documents (ICD) for the government furnished equipment (GFE) sensors will also be provided.  Offerors should be registered on FedTeds (https://www.fedteds.gov/) for document access.  Potential offerors must be willing and able to work/interface with foreign nationals as directed by the MDA.

 
Submission Procedures:


Respondents should submit a white paper of a maximum of 25 pages that provides the following information:  

1.	Company name, address, point of contact, phone number, e-mail address.  Company must certify that it is a U.S. business.

2.	Technical approach(es) to meeting MDA's test needs for an airborne optical sensor platform

3.	Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM ) Cost
 
4.	Estimated schedule, with major milestones highlighted, for platform development

5.	Technical, schedule, and cost risk assessments


A briefing package summarizing the white paper is also required with a limit of 20 slides.  Offerors should mark all proprietary data as appropriate.  The responses must be provided in electronic form with the white paper in Microsoft Word format and the briefing in Microsoft PowerPoint format.  


Responses are due no later than July 31, 2007.  MDA Government and contractor support personnel will review all responses.  Responses to the RFI will not be evaluated for any purpose other than determining potential competition and capabilities for the proposed effort.  Any responses not received by the due date will be considered late and therefore will not be considered.

<SUBJECT>R -- Sole Source Contract to Bishop Taxonomic and Archiving Services
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NFFR7400-7-12851
<RESPDATE>052507
<ARCHDATE>06092007
<CONTACT>Stephanie Garnett, Contract Specialist, Phone (808)944-2228, Fax (808)944-2141, Email stephanie.m.garnett@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of NOAA?s intent to negotiate a sole source contract with the Bishop Museum for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). This procurement is conducted in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), only one responsible source.   The Bishop Museum will be required to provide taxonomic support and assist in areas where there is either (1) no internal PIFSC expertise, or (2) insufficient staffing for the collection, identification, preservation, and curation of marine fish, corals, non-coral invertebrates, and algae originating from PIFSC coral reef surveys and other sources of samples from reefs of U.S. Pacific Islands. 

Field-based collecting will involve marine taxonomic specialists from the Bishop Museum working under the direction of the Principal Investigator on select PIFSC research cruises.  The Bishop Museum has the expertise and is required to accurately identify Pacific Island reef species. Field-collected samples will be preserved according to published museum standards. The collections will be sorted on the cruise or upon return to the Bishop Museum. Sorted specimens will be identified either locally or will be sent to the appropriate specialists designated by the Bishop Museum throughout the world who have already agreed to identify Bishop Museum material with no further costs to PIFSC. Upon identification, the specimens will be curated to museum standards and catalogued in the Bishop Museum?s catalog system. This material will be available through the Bishop Museum?s current collection web site, which is updated and maintained by the museum. The Bishop Museum?s taxonomic experts will work cooperatively with PIFSC scientists for training in identifications and examination of materials collected during the cruise surveys. 

Cruise reports shall be provided within six months of completion of each cruise. Reports shall include all taxonomic identifications to the lowest order of resolution possible made from materials collected on NMFS PIFSC cruises. Publications resulting from research, collaborative or independent, on these specimens will appropriately acknowledge PIFSC. As part of this contract, the Bishop Museum will produce a guide to introduced marine species found on PIFSC surveys and cruises that will be distributed in both printed and web formats. The guide will be updated as new species are found and identified. PIFSC will be provided with copies of the printed guide for use by their biologists conducting coral reef surveys. 

The Bishop Museum is the only taxonomic institution of internationally recognized quality in Hawaii. They have a staff of taxonomic specialists that have specific expertise in marine Indo-Pacific species of fish, corals, invertebrates, and algae. Those organisms are of primary concern for PIFSC Coral Reef Ecosystem Division because it is their responsibility to assess and monitor coral reef ecosystems throughout the Pacific Ocean, including the main Hawaiian Islands, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, Line Islands, Phoenix Islands, Palmyra, and Wake Atoll. 

Bishop Museum provided taxonomic support from 2002 to 2006 under contract AB133F-02-CN-0117 which contributed significantly to PIFSC objectives and milestones, and has already led to one peer-reviewed manuscript that is in review at Pacific Science, and 5 other manuscripts that are currently in preparation. The continued collaborative research between the Bishop Museum and PIFSC will extend the biogeographic ranges of known species, and result in the documentation of species new to science which will be published in peer-reviewed journals. 

The Bishop Museum and their collections are within traveling distance of the PIFSC laboratories and specimens. This advantage allows for convenient transfer of specimens between institutions, training of PIFSC staff, and cooperative research work. The Bishop Museum is also the only taxonomic service provider that can maintain PIFSC specimens that can be immediately accessed by PIFSC scientists whenever the need arises. 

The Bishop Museum is the officially designated State of Hawaii Museum on Natural and Cultural History (since 1988), and is fully capable of professionally curating large numbers of taxonomic samples and maintaining the same in reference collection for prolonged periods of time.  Their collections are fully catalogued and include taxonomic checklists of reef and associated species, online reports and complete bibliographies (their current inventory includes nearly 25,000 specimens).  The Bishop Museum has a permanent staff of taxonomists who are recognized experts in the identification of Pacific Island species, including marine reef fish, invertebrates and algae, and who often lecture on the systematic and related ecology of particular taxonomic groups. Their efforts continue to improve the quality of existing taxonomic data through the development and revision of taxonomic keys and the publication of new species descriptions.  The Museum has a working place in the worldwide network of taxonomic experts that allows them to obtain assistance in identification of specimens for taxonomic groups for which there are no experts physically at the museum.  

The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately July 1, 2007.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990 with a corresponding size standard of $6.5 million.  This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due date set forth in this notice may be considered by the Government.  All interested concerns must submit documentation in writing demonstrating their capability, expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the necessary work to Contract Specialist Stephanie Garnett at stephanie.m.garnett@noaa.gov no later than May 25, 2007.   Please contact Stephanie at 808-944-2228 with any questions regarding this procurement.  See Numbered Note 22.

<RESPDATE>060807
<CONTACT>Albert Dainton, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-254-6371, Fax null, Email albert.dainton@dhs.gov
<DESC>The goal of this BAA is to create an information management and information sharing system specifically designed to enhance the safety and effectiveness of this nation?s first responder community.  This phase is the next step toward developing a robust, fully functional, and operational UICDS compliant system.  While no specific architecture is to be preferred or discouraged, the final UICDS architecture specification will be a fusion of both current technologies and technological solutions that have yet to be realized.  The UICDS architecture must support and capture the following categories: 
?	Federal, State, Local, and Tribal first responder resources as defined within applicable Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD) and the NRP. 
?	Incorporation of the National Incident Management System (NIMS) with special attention to utilization of ICS protocols. 
?	Coordination and tracking of (response and recovery) resources at all Multi-Agency Coordination Centers and Entities, multiple transitional activities for National Planning Scenarios that describe the potential scope and magnitude of plausible major events that require coordination among various jurisdictions and all levels of government.
?	Unified messaging and dissemination of Public information as defined in NIMS. 
For the purposes of this Phase II BAA, the prototypes designed, developed, and piloted are expected to exhibit fundamental capabilities in a wide range of incident scenarios.  Demonstrations will be conducted to assess the architectures performance characteristics in a simulated environment.  The prototype(s) will be tested in likely venues initially chosen from among the Regional Technology Integration (RTI) cities, such as Seattle and Anaheim.  Exercises will be conducted at RTI location(s) in controlled, but realistic environments that will replicate the concept of operations, threats, and complexity of the anticipated use.   The test results of the pilot(s) and comments from end-users will permit additional refinement of requirements and specifications for UICDS with a final architectural specification being published at the end of this Phase.  In addition, system(s) reference implementation will be chosen and made available to system developer(s). 
Offerors may include additional system(s) capabilities that are relevant to the UICDS supported categories above, but must provide a justification in the proposal. 
Phase II BAA is a twenty-four (24) month effort to implement, deploy and pilot UICDS compliant system(s).  The BAA will consist of a base period of twelve (12) months and option period of (12) months which may be considered as a follow on effort.  The offeror should carefully read and respond to the BAA.  The failure to propose a requested option will lower the evaluation under the first evaluation criterion.

<DESC>03/30/07 DOCUMENT CONTROL SYSTEM:  STATEMENT OF WORK An VHA Intra-Net based electronic document management or control system for the Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service is required.  The document control system should meet or exceed the requirements of the College of American Pathologists Standards.  1.   This system will be designed to insure and document that:   All copies of laboratory policies and procedures in use are current;  Laboratory and ancillary-testing personnel have read the policies/procedures relevant to their job activities, including point-of-care-testing; All policies/procedures have been authorized by signature by the laboratory director or designee before implementation;  Laboratory policies and procedures are reviewed at least annually by the laboratory director or designee; Discontinued laboratory policies/procedures are kept in a separate file for a minimum of 2 years after the date of discontinuation (5 years for Transfusion Medicine-related materials).   A control log function lists all current policies and procedures and the locations of copies (including derivative documents such as card files, summary charts, appendices, supplements, product inserts).  The control log must contain other information including dates when policies/procedures were placed in service, schedule of review, identity of reviewer(s), and dates when policies/procedures were discontinued/superceded. Quality management procedures, forms, and records are maintained for a minimum of 2 years. 2.    The system will be comprised of a software application based on either an MS SQL or Oracle Database Server.  The software application will incorporate the capability to: Release documents in native application or as secure PDF files. Interface seamlessly with Microsoft Office software applications allowing limitless transfer and editing of documents. Identify users by name, organizational position, responsibilities, and to define limitations of operational rights for each individual. Mandate use of secure access and secure electronic signatures for all functions. Utilize e-mail, automatically, for all notifications of the need for review, suggestions for change, and of the issue of new versions of policies and procedures.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is a request for a quote (RFQ).  This will be awarded as a small business set-aside.  The solicitation document, incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20061219.  NAICS code is 541710.
  
Description:  The Air Force Research Laboratory has a requirement for investigations toward identifying variability in the mechanical properties of Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) rubber with the following specifications: 

Objective
Ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber is currently utilized as the state-of-the-art matrix material in solid rocket motor (SRM) internal insulation. Test firings of SRM?s containing such insulation have revealed inconsistencies in ablative performance, which may be traced to a variety of sources. Although other components are dispersed into the EPDM matrix for this technology application, the observed variability in the measured mechanical properties of the neat sulfur-vulcanized rubber may be the root of the problem, requiring investigation. The target of this program is to identify the sources,
likely chemical in nature, causing the irreproducibility in observed tensile properties of EPDM rubber, setting the stage for further structure ? ablative property relationship studies.

Description of Work
The request is for a one-time service contract that will provide non-personal services for all labor, tools, materials, and facilities to test EPDM through thermal and mechanical methods, both in the uncured and cured states (requiring compounding with sulfur). AFRL/PRSM and the contractor shall hold regular teleconferences to track the progress of the program. The contractor shall compound EPDM with sulfur through appropriate techniques as necessary (Brabender, Banbury, milling, etc.). The contractor shall
measure the thermal properties of uncured and sulfur-cured EPDM through thermal analysis such as, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), targeting the observance of glass ? rubber transitions as well as any crystallization and melting properties for each test sample following mechanical testing, noting that ethylene content may be tracked through this type of characterization. The contractor shall fabricate test coupons of EPDM (virgin and sulfur-vulcanized) for tensile measurements and provide AFRL/PRSM with the test specimens at the conclusion of the program effort. Mechanical testing shall follow industry standard guidelines such as, ASTM Standard D638. The contractor shall monitor the sulfur-vulcanization kinetics of EPDM through viscometry and/or thermal analysis techniques. A final report will be provided to
AFRL/PRSM at the conclusion of the program effort. 

This work will consist of the following:

Meet with AFRL (online or in person) to define material, testing matrix, and deliverables.
Estimated Delivery: Two (2) weeks after contract award

Submit report, give presentation (online or in person) to AFRL on research activities.
Estimated Delivery: Eight (8) weeks after contract award

Submit final report detailing all research activities conducted on the program.
Estimated Delivery: Sixteen (16) weeks after contract award

SELECTION CRITERIA
The selection factors are as follows:
&#56256;&#56451; Previous experience with ethylene propylene diene (EPDM) rubber and its sulfur vulcanization
&#56256;&#56451; The facilities and expertise required to perform rubber compounding
&#56256;&#56451; The facilities to fabricate samples and perform mechanical testing
&#56256;&#56451; Complete thermal analysis capabilities
&#56256;&#56451; Best value for the Government

Previous experience is more important than the facilities and expertise required to perform rubber compounding; which is more important than test sample fabrication and mechanical testing; which is more important than thermal analysis capabilities.

Details:

2.    Multi channel bit synchronizer/best source selector, 8 channel with 20 Mbps capability with the following specifications:

Requirement:

Bit synchronizer with Best Source Selection with the following characteristics:      Best source must be based on signal data quality (Eb/No), frame synchronization pattern is not a signal processing requirement.       Best source selection must not cause a switch between sources to cause the down stream frame synchronizer connected to the bit synchronizer/best source selector output to lose lock.     Best source selection must be seamless, no data errors can be tolerated.      Data source selector must be capable of processing encrypted (black) data.
Must not decrypt each data prior to best source selection data processing.      Best source selection of encrypted data based on Eb/No (Signal Quality)      Majority vote mode best source selection based on multiple sources correlated and a bit-by-bit voting is done to assemble the output data stream, when a 3rd source comes on-line it is automatically correlated with the other 2 sources, with full majority voting (weighted by the short and long term quality) invoked the error correction that results in better then a 3.3dB (two fold increase) performance improvement of the link.

2A.    Additional  best source selector interface to allow 2 groups of best of 4 source selection.

The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights (1) within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

(d) Disputes. This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613).

Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(End of provision) 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open  and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

P.	EVALUATION FACTORS:
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsive and responsible firm whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price related factors considered.  The Government does reserve the right to make multiple awards.  The Technical evaluation factors are Technical and Management Plan and Past Performance.  Technical and Management Plan is more important than Past Performance.  When combined these technical evaluation factors are more important than price.  As the technical evaluation of quotes approaches equality, greater will be the importance of price in making the award determination.  In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced quote.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted. 
Awards may also be made on the basis of initial quotes without discussions. 
Quoters are therefore cautioned that each initial quote should contain the quoter?s best terms. 
Technical and Management Plan:  The technical and management plan shall identify the organizational structure, staffing, operating procedures, and employee benefits of the firm.  The plan shall also include the technical approach to successfully provide these services ensuring no lapse in staffing.  The plan shall include an entry and exit transition plan.  The Plan should be simple, easy to read and clearly describes contractor responsibilities, any proposed subcontracting arrangements and communication and coordination plans with the Government.  The technical and management plan shall also include the firms contingency and continuity of operations plans in the event of natural or manmade disasters that may disrupt service capabilities.  
Past Performance:  The quoter shall identify three (3) contracts/orders that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance.  Recent is defined as within the last three (3) years.  Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude to the work identified in the SOW.  Please include the following information: a) Project Title; b) Description of the Project;  c) Contract/Task Order Number; d) Contract/Task Order Amount; e) Government; f) Agency/Organization; g) COTR?s name, address, phone number and email address; h) Contracting Officer?s name, address, telephone number and email address; i) Current status, e.g. completed and/or in progress, start and estimated completion dates; j) A brief narrative of why your firm believes this reference is relevant to the proposed task.

Price:  The price quote shall include the following: Fully burdened on-site hourly rates for each proposed labor category for the base period and for each option period.  Department of Labor Wage Determination No: 05-2103 is incorporated into this solicitation.  

The technical quote submission shall be limited to 10 one-sided pages (inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.).  The price proposal has no page limitations.

Q.	SUBMISSION OF QUOTE
All quotes are due no later than 2:00pm, local Washington, D.C. time, May 4, 2007.  Quotes are to be e-mailed to Mr. Bernard Salter, Jr. at Bernard.salter@dhs.gov.  No faxes will be accepted.

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.  

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.

DCHA/OTI's strategic objectives are based on the premise that fast, direct, and overt political development assistance is needed as a catalyst to move countries beyond crisis to stability.  When a crisis occurs in a priority country, DCHA/OTI has the ability to engage in that country and initiate a country program. A country program is designed to address the fundamental constraints prohibiting the country from emerging from crisis. 

USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  The typical OTI country strategy follows US Government policy and directly involves: reshaping hard-line attitudes and perceptions; promoting democracy, human rights, and basic freedoms; disseminating objective information; and effecting positive political change - wherever and whenever possible.

OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/


INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to hire multiple Program Managers to support USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) regional activities.  The Program Manager will assist one of OTI's regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participate in new country program assessments as the need arises.  OTI currently has three regional teams: Asia and Near East (ANE), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC).  This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.

This position is a laddered position, which begins at the GS-11 equivalent level.  The candidate may be considered for a GS-12 equivalent level after at least one year if s/he receives a recommendation for advancement from the supervisor as part of an excellent performance rating. Advancement to the GS-12 level is not guaranteed.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this solicitation is to provide additional PSC staff to provide program management functions for OTI's regional program teams.

The term "service employee" does not include any employee who qualifies as an 
executive, administrative, or professional employee as those terms are identified in Regulations, Part 541, issued under the Fair Standard Act. (See CFR, Part 541.)
ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: 
HEALTH & WELFARE: Life, accident, and health insurance plans, sick leave, pension plans, civic and personal leave, severance pay, and savings and thrift plans.    
Minimum employer contributions costing an average of $3.01 per hour computed on the basis of all hours worked by service employees employed on the contract.
VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or 
successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service 
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or 
successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the 
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)
HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4.174)
** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract 
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by 
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an 
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.
                         ** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **
Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the Wage and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only upon such contingencies as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage determination, incorporation of the wage determination in the contract, adjusting the contract price, etc."  (The relevant CBA section) in the collective bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting "arm's length negotiation" under section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations.  This wage determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits paid under the predecessor contract.
Source of Occupational Title and Descriptions:
The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the 
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations," Fourth Edition, January 1993, 
as amended by the Third Supplement, dated March 1997, unless otherwise indicated.  
This publication may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, at 
202-783-3238, or by writing to the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.  Copies of specific job descriptions may also be obtained from the appropriate contracting officer.
REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}
Conformance Process:
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage 
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable 
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted 
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such 
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.
The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:
1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed 
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.
3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent 
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).
4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or 
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or 
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.
5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.
6) The contractor informs the affected employees.
Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.
When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of 
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.  Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is a request for a quote (RFQ).  This will be awarded as a small business set-aside.  The solicitation document, incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20061219.  NAICS code is 541710.
  
Description:  The Air Force Research Laboratory has a requirement for investigations toward identifying variability in the mechanical properties of Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) rubber with the following specifications: 

Objective
Ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber is currently utilized as the state-of-the-art matrix material in solid rocket motor (SRM) internal insulation. Test firings of SRM?s containing such insulation have revealed inconsistencies in ablative performance, which may be traced to a variety of sources. Although other components are dispersed into the EPDM matrix for this technology application, the observed variability in the measured mechanical properties of the neat sulfur-vulcanized rubber may be the root of the problem, requiring investigation. The target of this program is to identify the sources,
likely chemical in nature, causing the irreproducibility in observed tensile properties of EPDM rubber, setting the stage for further structure ? ablative property relationship studies.

Description of Work
The request is for a one-time service contract that will provide non-personal services for all labor, tools, materials, and facilities to test EPDM through thermal and mechanical methods, both in the uncured and cured states (requiring compounding with sulfur). AFRL/PRSM and the contractor shall hold regular teleconferences to track the progress of the program. The contractor shall compound EPDM with sulfur through appropriate techniques as necessary (Brabender, Banbury, milling, etc.). The contractor shall
measure the thermal properties of uncured and sulfur-cured EPDM through thermal analysis such as, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), targeting the observance of glass ? rubber transitions as well as any crystallization and melting properties for each test sample following mechanical testing, noting that ethylene content may be tracked through this type of characterization. The contractor shall fabricate test coupons of EPDM (virgin and sulfur-vulcanized) for tensile measurements and provide AFRL/PRSM with the test specimens at the conclusion of the program effort. Mechanical testing shall follow industry standard guidelines such as, ASTM Standard D638. The contractor shall monitor the sulfur-vulcanization kinetics of EPDM through viscometry and/or thermal analysis techniques. A final report will be provided to
AFRL/PRSM at the conclusion of the program effort. 

This work will consist of the following:

Meet with AFRL (online or in person) to define material, testing matrix, and deliverables.
Estimated Delivery: Two (2) weeks after contract award

Submit report, give presentation (online or in person) to AFRL on research activities.
Estimated Delivery: Eight (8) weeks after contract award

Submit final report detailing all research activities conducted on the program.
Estimated Delivery: Sixteen (16) weeks after contract award

SELECTION CRITERIA
The selection factors are as follows:
&#56256;&#56451; Previous experience with ethylene propylene diene (EPDM) rubber and its sulfur vulcanization
&#56256;&#56451; The facilities and expertise required to perform rubber compounding
&#56256;&#56451; The facilities to fabricate samples and perform mechanical testing
&#56256;&#56451; Complete thermal analysis capabilities
&#56256;&#56451; Best value for the Government

Previous experience is more important than the facilities and expertise required to perform rubber compounding; which is more important than test sample fabrication and mechanical testing; which is more important than thermal analysis capabilities.

CLOSING DATE:	June 5, 2007, 5:00 p.m. EDT 

SUBJECT:  Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for a Program Manager (Multiple Positions) in Washington, DC.
 
Ladies/Gentlemen:

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking applications (Optional Form 612 only) from qualified U.S. citizens to provide personal services as a Program Manager under a personal services contract, as described in the solicitation.

The purpose of this Amendment is to provide the two attachments referenced in the solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i)entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
