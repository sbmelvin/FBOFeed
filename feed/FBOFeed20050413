<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for work to characterize NiCrAlY and CuCrAL coatings cold sprayed on GRCop-84 copper substrates. The effort will evaluate the differences compared to current coatings methods for GRCop-84 such as vacuum plasma spray coatings.Since the coatings process is the primary item being studied, the coating must be applied only by cold spraying. Alternative methods are being evaluated under different contracts.  NASA/GRC intends to procure this work from ASB Industries, Inc., 1031 Lambert Street, Barberton, OH 44203 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements . The justification for lack of competition is that ASB Industries, Inc. has state of the art coating apparatus and has developed many proprietary processes to apply dense and uniform coatings. ASB has provided similar work for NASA GRC under contract C-74527A and this work is for evaluation purposes only and to maintain continuity of using similar proprietary processes for direct comparison with contract C-74527A Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 22, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing software lifecycle support to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Enterprise Business System (EBS) Program office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB).  A proposed draft Statement of Work and Capability Package are attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the Air Force Research Laboratory and the respondent's potential ability to meet the Government's requirements. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Enterprise Business System (EBS) program office analyses AFRL requirements in conjunction with AFRL, AFMC, and AF policy to deliver integrated, enterprise solutions to its customers throughout the Lab.

This includes tasks related to many stages of the software acquisition lifecycle process. Performance is to begin not later than 6 Sep 2005.

The software lifecycle support includes, but is not limited to, Project Management, Application Development, Planning, Implementation, Systems Integration, Systems Support, Configuration Management, Requirements Development, Requirements Analysis, Risk Management, Technology Evaluation, Data Management, Application Support, and Training.  This effort will provide the full spectrum of activities needed to support AFRL Scientists, Engineers, Business Managers, and AFRL customers.

<DESC>The Air Force Historical Office (AF/HOH) is offering a thirty-six month contract for an unclassified manuscript biography tentatively entitled Andrews: Architect of Air Power. The manuscript shall be an analytical, scholarly biography, neither hagiographic nor celebratory, of Lt. Gen. Frank M. Andrews. General Andrews was the commander of GHQ Air Force during the late 1930s, a primary leader of the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) during World War II, and one of the founding fathers of the United States Air Force (USAF). Despite his importance and because of his early death in May 1943, a single-volume study of his life has yet to be written. This contract volume will provide the USAF with an insightful, scholarly historical assessment of General Andrews’s significance to and involvement in the development and growth of air power before and during World War II. While the manuscript will cover the general’s life, it will focus on him as commander, as leader, and as innovator. The volume will offer lessons that pertain to today’s USAF.  


The contractor shall provide the historical expertise, personnel, materials, supervision and facilities necessary to research, write and edit an unclassified historical manuscript.  The contractor shall carry out the project using contractor office space, equipment, and supplies. The contractor shall conduct primary research in USAF repositories, federal archives, and in other record collections as needed. USAF repositories include, but are not limited to, the Air Force Historical Research Agency at Maxwell AFB, Alabama; the Office of Air Force History in Washington, D.C.; the Air Force Academy Library, at Colorado Springs, Colorado, Air Combat Command History Office, at Langley Field, Virginia; Air Force Historical Foundation, at Andrews AFB, Maryland; and the Air Force Museum, in Dayton, Ohio. The contractor shall not abuse the privileges granted to researchers by those institutions and shall follow all rules and regulations set by those institutions.  

The contractor shall be responsible for any photocopying or photographic reproduction charges incurred at all archives, repositories, and libraries. The contractor shall conduct a search to acquire photographs, maps, and other illustrations for the manuscript. The contractor shall seek advice from AF/HOH on possible sources for photographs and other potential illustrations. The contractor shall obtain AF/HOH permission before he/she contacts any USAF field historians outside the AF/HOH or the Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA). The manuscript shall be written in a fashion to facilitate readability and ease if understanding.  

All copyrights of this manuscript will become Government property.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this acquisition is 711510 and the corresponding SIC code is 8999 with the size standard being $6.0M.  The period of performance is 3 years for a total of 36 months.   The contractor shall adhere to timeline schedule as outlined in the Statement of Work.  This is a competitive “best value” solicitation.  

This procurement is 100% SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS.  This solicitation will be distributed solely from the World Wide Web at the following address beginning on or after 29 Apr 2005:   http://www.eps.gov    When the solicitation is posted, it is imperative that interested parties regularly review this website for any updated amendments to any and all documents.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA).  This announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action for the proposed purchase of two Mobile Detection and Assessment Systems (MDAS) for test and evaluation by the United States Air Force.  The acquisition is to include integration tasks to incorporate Government Furnished radio, radar, thermal imager, power generator and alarm display control station equipment into an MDAS system. This purchase is a follow-on contract to General Services Administration (GSA) Task Order 5TS5703D433 established under GSA Contract GS-35F-0407J issued in February 2004.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Sensor Technologies and Systems, Inc., under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The GSA Task Order has completed initial design work, accepted delivery, verified operational status, and accomplished training of the Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) identified below. Deliverables will include two systems.  Each system will be capable of operating up to four short range radars and one long range radar.  The system will locally control pan and tilt of Government furnished thermal imagers with the standard driver and also accomplish an Ethernet driver for remote capability to point the camera at the active target. Communications will be wireless using Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) radio sets.  The integrated system will physically protect EPLRS radio equipment (Radio set, key pad and power supply) from theft and unauthorized access in accordance with established communication security requirements.  The system remote units will autonomously operate to provide 168 hours of continuous operation.  A capability will be provided to allow primary control from two locations with a hand-off to ensure only one primary controller at a time through remote radar communication and control (R2C2).  The acquisition will establish delivery of the two systems, delivery of design documentation, delivery of manuals for operation and maintenance, training material and delivery of a test report.  Support tasks will include training, test/evaluation support at Air Force locations, and integration testing with established alarm display systems at an Air Force test site.  Government Furnished Property will include:  Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) radio equipment (RT-1720F(C)/G, NSN 5820-01-490-7018), SEI Man-Portable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (MSTAR) equipment, Telephonics Advanced Radar Surveillance System (ARSS) radar equipment, Sensor Technologies and Systems Perimeter Surveillance Radar System (PSRS) equipment, EMX NightSight Thermal Imager equipment, National Geospatial Agency (NGA) provided maps, portable generator equipment, trailers, and antenna mounts.  The contractor accomplishing the work is required to have a facility clearance, an active Communications Security (COMSEC) account, personnel trained for handling COMSEC Accountable items, and expertise in handling Limited Distribution Mapping and Charting data from the DoD National Geospatial Agency.  The contractor shall be experienced in set-up and operation of the EPLRS radio equipment, EPLRS Network Manager, preparation of radio frequency spectrum certification applications for DoD review, and in providing specialized training for siting and operating intrusion detection radar systems.  The contractor shall have experience in preparing test plans and procedures for evaluation of long and short range perimeter radar systems.  System performance is required to provide intrusion detection of personnel to 2 kilometers (minimum) for the MSTAR and ARSS, 250 meters for the PSRS, and Thermal imagery capability for assessment of targets at up to 300 meters from each remote unit.  Each of these detection ranges is for an individual upright person.  Exterior equipment will operate from -30C to +50C and in humidity from 0% to 90% non-condensing. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This acquisition is to be accomplished under FAR Part 15.  Any firms that believe they can meet the above requirements may identify their interest and capability to the Contract Specialist via email within 15 days of this notice.  Responses shall be limited to ten pages.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Call the Contract Specialist, Ms. Cathy Mirra at (781) 377-5998 or email Cathy.Mirra@hanscom.af.mil with questions regarding this notice.

<DESC>The scope of work includes but is not limited to removal of the existing membrane, insulation and bituminous flashing and installation of a new roofing system appropriate for the building. Generally, all existing copper counter flashings should be reused. Copper-to-limestone coping joints should be resealed with new backer rods and caulking.

[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA’s) Transportation Security Laboratory (TSL) is sponsoring a Capabilities Demonstration for walk-through Enhanced Metal Detectors (EMD).  The TSA invites voluntary participation from sources that offer EMDs to support a laboratory trial.   The TSA is interested in evaluating market-ready EMDs.  Respondents are asked to provide one unit, an operation manual, on-site representative, set-up and same day removal of their EMD.  The demonstration will take only one day for each unit and will be at no cost to the TSA. Each vendor can participate in the test and will retain ownership of their EMD for the duration of the demonstration (one day). The laboratory demonstration for EMD capabilities is scheduled for the first two weeks of May 2005, and will examine the ability and capabilities of individual EMD systems.  

The focus of this Capabilities Demonstration is to evaluate technologies and systems designed to screen passengers.  The goal is to provide the TSL access to a variety of potential technologies and systems for evaluation.  The TSA may incorporate previously undemonstrated capabilities in future TSA procurement specifications.  Both vendors who are currently on the TSA EMD Qualified Product List and who are not on the QPL may provide EMD machines for a capabilities demonstration.

All interested parties must contact Mr. Adam Freimanis with an email at adam.freimanis@dhs.gov by April 22, 2005 at 11:00 AM EST.  The email must contain; POC name, POC phone number, Company name, EMD model name and a preference date for demonstration at the TSL near Atlantic City, N.J.   This action supports informational objectives and in no way binds the Government to a contract at this time or in the future.  The Government will not assume any liability during the testing and will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the vendor.  If you have any questions please contract Mr. Adam Freimanis either by email or phone (571) 227-3878.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Florida State University, 97 South Woodward Avenue, Tallahassee, FL 32306-4166 on a sole source basis for support for the formulation of a Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) protection program plan for FY06. Florida State University will be tasked by the Government to assist Naval Surface Warfare Center in supporting the technical and programmatic oversight of the Protection CBD Science & Technology Program. The proposed Principal Investigator (PI) is uniquely qualified to provide this support with the blend of capabilities, experience and knowledge of the Naval Surface Warfare Center to successfully complete the tasks required for accomplishment under this contract. The PI is a subject matter expert across most technology areas applicable to CBD protection. His expertise includes filtration (particulate and vapor), shelters, masks, and clothing. His knowledge of!  the physiological implications of these technologies is critical to the selection and execution of the technical projects. The PI worked for nine years as program manager of the DoD CBD S&T program in the area of individual and collective protection. As a result of that experience, he is intimately aware of both past S&T efforts and emerging technologies. He helped the Joint Requirements Office (JRO) to develop their Baseline Capabilities Assessment and the associated capability gaps. He is a DAWIA certified level 3 acquisition professional for Systems Planning, Research, Development and Engineering. The unique knowledge resident at FSU within these areas of expertise provides a knowledge base that would require an extensive learning program (and thus additional and unnecessary cost and time to the Government) by any other vendor. Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Co! de 541710 applies. SBA standard is 500 employees.

The contaminants may include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL).  

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable.  A contract will be awarded to the responsible firm whose proposal, conforms to the solicitation, and is determined the "Best Value" to the Government based on cost and non—cost factors.

<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for fuels management services to reduce the risk of wildland fires in Chaves County in New Mexico. The project will consist of removing saltcedar and Russian olive trees along specific areas of the Pecos River corridor by a mechanical extraction method for the purpose of reducing fire hazard potential, improving riparian habitat, and potentially increasing available ground and surface water. The project areas are comprised of various densities of salt cedar and Russian olive within the floodplain of the Pecos River. The project areas are not physically delineated by markers but are self-evident when visiting the sites due to the presence of saltcedar trees grouped in dense stands, growing singly and lining the banks of the Pecos River. Generally, the project area is delineated by the boundary of the 100-year floodplain. The Contractor will extricate all saltcedar and Russian olive trees and saplings inside a flagged boundary. The extricated vegetation will be piled or windrowed on site in areas specified by the BLM for future burning or mulching. In some cases, the use of a front end loader may be needed to rearrange the brush piles/windrows to allow for future burning or mulching. Raking may be required to arrange slash into windrows or piles. Treatment may include some acreage of private land adjacent to federal land. This includes furnishing labor, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals to perform all work necessary to perform the required services. The period of performance will begin shortly after the date of award and continue for approximately six months. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115310. This solicitation will be available on or about April 20, 2005. A pre-proposal site tour will be held on April 27, 2005 at 9:00 A.M. at the BLM Roswell Field Office in Roswell, New Mexico. Details of the tour will be provided upon issuance of the solicitation. Potential offerors may obtain a copy of the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided. Contractors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered eligible for award.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) with TSI Incorporated of St. Paul, Minnesota for three MODEL 3563 integrating nephelometers to measure the light scattering coefficient of the atmospheric aerosol. This parameter (the light scattering coefficient) is a central and essential component of the suite of aerosol measurements made by NOAA in its aerosol sampling network. The network requires multiwavelength, high-sensitivity nephelometers that integrate the scattered light over two angular ranges (at all angles, as in the earlier instruments, and only at backward scattering angles). Among the critical specifications, are operation at multiple wavelengths and over two different ranges of angular integration. This notice is for information purposes only. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government’s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. No RFQ package is available. This procurement is being conducted per Simplified Acquisition Procedures FAR Part 13. Terms and conditions and agency level protest procedures are referenced at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/subpart_33_1.html#1046527.Hard copy in full text is available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  The anticipated award date is April 29, 2005.

Sole source determination is based on HKL Technology Inc. being the sole source manufacturer and provider of the existing equipment, the proprietary equipment required for the upgrade, and the proprietary software necessary to utilize the equipment.  Furthermore, purchase of a different model Forescatter Detector would cause NIST’s existing projects to lose capability, and may damage the existing NIST property.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider responses received by April 29, 2005.  A determination by the Government not to compete the acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Range Instrumentation Systems Squadron (RISS), Air Combat Support Systems Group (ACSSG), Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB FL, is seeking information from qualified sources interested in the acquisition described below, which will utilize funds from the DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR CONTRACTORS EMPLOYING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES defined as follows. Eligible contractors are those that are operated on a for-profit or non-profit basis that--(A) employ severely disabled individuals at a rate that averages not less than 33 percent of the company’s total workforce over a period prescribed by the Secretary; (b) pays not less than the minimum wage prescribed pursuant to section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C 206) to the employees who are severely disabled individuals; and (C) provides for its employees health insurance and a retirement plan comparable to those provided for employees by business entities of similar size in its industrial sector or geographic region. A severely disabled individual is an individual with a disability as defined in section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S. C 12102)) who has a severe physical or mental impairment that seriously limits one or more functional capacities. If you believe your company can meet all of the requirements of the contract, and of the Demonstration Program, please e-mail the points of contact below with a notification of interest. Please include self-certification that your company meets the disabled employees standards set forth in the above paragraph. Only those companies that meet the requirements defined will be considered for award. Please do not respond to this request for information if your company does not meet the requirements. The Air Force (USAF) anticipates contracting with a company to build to print a new USAF designed hanger band assembly for Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pods. The new hanger band assembly was designed and developed by the USAF for Department of Defense (DOD) use. The new design will replace the current design ACMI pod hanger band assembly system, which utilizes AIM-9 missile hanger band assemblies and hanger band parts. The current design, which is based on the AIM-9 missile, is now known to be composed of a number of life cycle parts which are expensive to maintain in both time and dollars. The new USAF designed hanger band assembly eliminated the current known issue with the current ACMI pod hanger band system and is designed for automated manufacture. The principle manufacturing processes employed in the manufacture of this design include CNC water jet cutting, CNC turning, CNC milling, and welding of non-ferrous metals. The successful contractor will supply all labor and materials to manufacture the new hanger band assembly in accordance with the technical data package with the possible exception of the two 5/16-24 UNJF bolts used in each assembly per DWG 639AS6699, which are DOD unique. The Government may elect to supply these bolts to the contractor as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), due to the Government’s purchasing power of this DOD unique part. The contractor will propose on the manufacture of approximately 900 hanger band assemblies, including a first article which will be inspected and test fit on an ACMI pod under Government direction before the contractor will be approved for production. The contractor will also be required to propose for additional hanger band assemblies in lots of approximately 100, indicating any price breaks for varying quantities. This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties for submission packages in response to this RFI. The final requirement, if any, would be defined under a formal Request for Proposal. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website located at www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information. Respondents to this Notice will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of information submitted.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) concerning system security certification and accreditation support for planned network-enabled weapons.  Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to determine whether a capability exists to provide network-enabled weapons system security certification and accreditation support and ensures all requirements of the Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) are met.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  

The Air Force, in conjunction with its sister Services, is working to develop a capability whereby network-enabled weapons can communicate with operational nodes such as fighter/bomber aircraft and land/sea-based C2 platforms to facilitate operational advantage.  For a weapon to participate in such network communication, the weapon system will require a Certificate of Networthiness (CoN).  The CoN can only be granted after the network and individual weapons receive a Certification and Accreditation (C&A).  The Air Armament Center, Capabilities Integration Directorate, Technology Transition and Concept Development Division, is seeking information to determine if a capability exists whereby a knowledgeable and experienced contractor can provide the following support to the Capabilities Integration Directorate and to individual weapon system program offices at the Air Armament Center:  

-- Assist with the development of an Information Assurance (IA) Strategy for Network-Enabled Weapons

-- Perform requisite analysis and develop products to ensure network-enabled weapons’ compliance with DoDI 5200.40 (soon to be DoDI 8510.1); DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP), 30 December 1997, DoD 8510.1-M; DITSCAP Application Manual, 31 July 2000, the National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP, NSTISSI No. 1000) April 2000, and AFI33-202 (the USAF implementation of DITSCAP), 17 June 2004.  Examples of products include but are not limited to a System Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA) and a Cryptographic Key CONOPS for Network-Enabled Weapons.

-- Research, document and create processes and procedures to ensure network-enabled weapons adherence to IA policy, requirements, and regulations and provide necessary training to the Capabilities Integration Directorate and to individual weapon system program offices at the Air Armament Center.

Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to provide relevant examples of ongoing and previous contractual efforts with the Government that support the desired capabilities described. Respondents may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. Respondents are encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately.  AAC/XR uses service contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements to include review of these capabilities submittals.  Service contracts contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires the service contractors to protect the data and prohibits the service contractors from using the data for any purpose other than that for which the data was presented.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, as well as subject to modification, and is in no way binding on the Government. Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the Air Armament Center, Capabilities Integration Directorate, Technology Transition and Concept Development Division (AAC/XRS), Bldg 349, 207 West D Ave., Suite 301, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-6844, ATTN: Ms. Stacey Darhower, or sent electronically to stacey.darhower@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>An anticipated release date of this solicitation will be 28 April 2005.  This RFP is to solicit a quantity of 29,502 each Charge, Burster M54A1 M110A2, NSN:  1320-01-464-2033, part number 12991152, with first article required by 27 Jan 2006.  Deliver y will being in April 2006.  This acquisition is being restricted to U.S. and Canada, and offerors are cautioned that the requirement must be manufactured in the U.S. or Canada, and proposals must be submitted in U.S. dollars.  The TDP is classified as Dis tribution D.  A copy of the TDP is available upon request from the contract specialist, Ms. Kim Crecelius, AMSFS-CCA-R.  To receive a copy of the tech data, you must first be certified with the US/Canada Joint Certification Program.  Please provide a copy of this certification or certification number with your request.  The M54A1 Burster is a component of the M110A2 Smoke, White Phosphorous (WP) Projectile.  When the M110A2 Projectile is fired out of the gun tube, the installed fuze functions on impact wher eby it detonates the M54A1 Burster, which reptures the burster case and projectile case, and disperses the (WP) filler.  The WP ignites spontaneously upon contact with air and produces a dense smoke that is used for marking and signaling purposes, and can also be used to provide screening of mechanized or infantry maneuvers.  The unique processes required to produce the M54A1 Burster include melt pour and radiographic inspection capability.  Also contaminated wastes and the ability to receive, handle, store , inpsect, and test the item.  TNT Type I Flake, NSN:  1376-00-628-333, MIL-T-243 and CYCLOTOL Type I 75/25, NSN:  1376-00-007-4872, will be Government Furnished Material (GFM) for both the basic and the option quantities.  It is anticipated that this acti on will result in a best value, competitive 3-year (Base year with an option and 2 Option Years) multiple year firm fixed price contract.  There will be an evaluated option (150% for year 1, and 250% for years 2 and 3) included in the award.  The acquisiti on will be awarded based on the evaluation of technical/management, recent relevant past performance, price, and small business utilization plan that provides the best value to the Government; therefore, the award may be made to other than the low offeror.   It is not known at this time if there will be a pre-solicitaion conference.  If it is determined that one is necessary, the synopsis will be amended to reflect the time and place.  Notes 8 and 13 apply.

<DESC>This request is being solicited on an unrestricted base. This is an Architect-Engineer (A-E) service acquisition for a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a base period of one year and two option periods of one year each. The NAICS Code is 541330. A-E services are required for the preparation of parametric estimating and programming, development of plans, specifications and cost estimates suitable for bidding and repairs, renovations, alterations, upgrades, possible replacement (new construction), and associated demolition work for various projects primarily at Seymour Johnson AFB and occasionally at Dare County Bomb Range and Fort Fisher in NC.  A-E services for these projects will be accomplished under Task Orders written against the IDIQ contract. Construction cost ranges for these projects vary; however, it is not contemplated that the cost range for any individual job will be between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The selected A-E firm(s) will be required to participate in an orientation, scope of work and site visit meetings (when requested) within 7 calendar days after receiving the request for proposal for a project. The maximum monetary limit for all task orders under this contract shall not exceed $2,250,000 with the maximum task order amount of $299,000. The guaranteed minimum for the IDIQ contract is $10,000 for the life of the contract. The work involved is multi-disciplined and includes, but is not limited to architectural, structural, civil, environmental, plumbing, electrical, management information systems (MIS) technicians, fire protection, site work, and mechanical requirements. Field surveying, landscaping design, and architectural rendering capabilities may be required. Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required.  Familiarity with English and metric system of measurements is required. Disciplines and capabilities may be represented within the same firm or with consultants that regularly work with the primary firm. The firm(s) must also be able to provide part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering services. All drawings are to be in electronic attachment format, DFX or DGN format and shall be 100% compatible with Computer Assisted Design Drawing Software (CADD).  Documentation shall be furnished with each drawing file detailing level layer usage, and scale information for drawings.  The selected firm(s) must have the capability of providing final drawings formatted in AutoCAD 2002 or higher.  Each final drawing shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system. The firm(s) shall also be able to obtain MaxView/SourceView software and convert drawing files formatted for electronic posting over the Internet. Each converted drawing file shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system. Firms are reminded of the requirement in FAR 36.601-3(a), which states that the construction design specifications shall require the maximum practicable use of recovered materials considering the performance requirements, availability, price reasonableness, and cost-effectiveness. The possibility of hazardous materials, i.e., asbestos, lead paint, and other materials may exist at project sites. All hazardous materials licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project site are required by the A-E firm(s) or their sub-contractors. The general intention is to provide for such design and engineering services as necessary to support the procurement of construction requirements/ acquisitions. For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as technical reports, studies, site investigations, concept designs, cost estimates, surveys, shop drawings reviews, construction consultation and inspection, Title II, preparation of construction record drawings, and O&M manuals, may be required at any time up to final acceptance of all work. Because the IDIQ contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns to include all elements referenced in FAR 52.219-9. All contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.  All offerors in response to this solicitation shall complete electronic annual representation and certifications at http://www.bpn.gov/orca in conjunction with required regisistration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

Correspondence may be sent by post to Mr. Dinwoody at the following address: James Dinwoody AFSAC/PKP 1822 Van Patton Dr. Bldg. 210 Front Wright Patterson, OH  45433-5337 NOTE: Our customers are concerned with maintaining visibility and accuracy of  shipped assets.   We are proposing a requirement to require all incoming and  outgoing material to be shipped to a centralized location in order to confirm  receipt + verification of correct asset, accuracy of shipping documents and to  perform a final inspection before shipment.  Since cost is also a priority for  our customers, we don’t want this to result in a large price increase.  We  would like your comments concerning the best commercial practices for this  requirement.  Is there a better way to ensure asset in-transit visibility?   Please provide your comments by 3 December 2004. NOTE: All Prospective Offerors:  Please review all updated attached files  below and provide your comments and questions by 3 December 2004.  It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.   SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III)  ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought Parts and Repair  Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and  operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently  active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some  customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives  more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material  (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is  not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for  supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However,  the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD  approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of  the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized)  sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award  fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised  to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of  contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled "NASA Exploration System of Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) Pre-Solicitation Workshop", which was posted on March 17, 2005.  TO WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS: We thank you for your ongoing participation in ESMD’s efforts to construct an approach to Systems Engineering & Integration (SE&I) in the Directorate and its Development Programs Division.  In constructing this approach, ESMD has placed great emphasis on engagement and dialogue with industry as a means for refining its SE&I organization and strategy. During the last month, you have reviewed and responded to a Request for Information and a Statement of Objectives (SOO) for a Development Programs Division SE&I Contractor, and have joined us for an Industry Day in Washington, DC.  During the week to come, you will join us in Nashville, Tennessee for a workshop where we will collaboratively examine a set of issues that have formative influence on the content and structure of the Request for Proposals for the Development Programs Division SE&I Contractor.  Specifically, the workshop’s splinter sessions will examine:  Constellation Associate Contractor (e.g. CEV Prime) Issues  Organizational Conflict of Interest & Hardware Exclusion Issues  Acquisition Process Issues  Simulation-Based Acquisition (SBA) Implementation  Systems Engineering & Integration Scope  ESMD’s RFP formulation baseline schedule included a release of key plenary documentation to Industry prior to the workshop, including a Systems Engineering & Integration Implementation Plan, applicable Systems Engineering Management Plans (SEMPs), and a draft Statement of Work (SOW).  ESMD has chosen to hold these documents for additional internal review prior to release to Industry, to provide Directorate and Agency executives with the opportunity to approve their preliminary content prior to release.	During the course of the workshop, ESMD will discuss the general content of these documents with workshop participants to facilitate valuable exchange, in preparation for their review later in the Draft RFP process.

<DESC>THIS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION IS BEING AMENDED TO CHANGE THE CLOSING DATE TO FRIDAY, APRIL 15, 2004 3:30 P.M. CST.     (i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial supplies prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, and supplemental information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  (ii) The reference number for this effort is APPQMBFM-0014-5 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  (iii) The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect at the time of publication.  Provisions and clauses incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) can be accessed on the Internet at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/  (iv) This requirement consists of three (3) line items: (1) Forty-thousand (40,000) Gypsy Moth Delta Traps – brown (2) One hundred-thousand (100,000) Gypsy Moth Delta Traps – green (3) Sixty-thousand (60,000) Gypsy Moth Delta Traps – orange   The Delta Trap design is required in the three colors and quantities listed.  (v) Deliverables and acceptance of deliverables will be FOB destination, at USDA Moore Air Base, 22675 N. Moorefield Road #6407, Edinburg, TX  78541. (vi) The traps awarded under this contract must be delivered to the destination no later than May 20, 2005. See attached document which describes the required packaging instructions.  (vii) Each quote at a minimum must meet the technical specifications as follows in order to be technically acceptable: The traps shall be fabricated of hard sized, liquid packaging grade ½ gallon milk carton paperboard stock .024 inch nominal thickness and polyethylene plastic-coated on both sides.  Variance from nominal thickness no greater than +.002 will be tolerable.  The coating is typically .0062” outside (=9 lbs. per 3,000 square ft.) and .0012” inside.  It is essential that the traps described herein are capable of withstanding outside service for a period of 90 days without losing shape, curling, or degrading.  The quality of the paperboard must meet industry standard milk carton grade or equivalent and must not leak exhibiting good liquid holdout capability, especially where edges and cuts are exposed. This is measured by a “paperboard test” which tests the sample paperboard against an international paperboard standard. The industry standard range of weight for water absorption should be 1.5% – 2%, and the percent of water absorbed in the sample paperboard should be equal to or less than the industry standard or not greater than 10% of the standard. The size, cutting, perforating, and precreasing shall be in accordance with the attached blueprint.  Should the precreasing be directional, it should be done in such a manner that will assist in folding the traps into assembly.  Precreasing shall be done in a manner that does not cut or otherwise damage the plastic coating.  The trap interior color shall match the exterior.  The process used to color the trap surfaces shall be resistant to fading and withstand exposure to sunlight for a period of 60 days without appreciable loss of color.  A grid on inch squares shall be printed in white on the interior surfaces.  The width of the grid lines shall be between 1/58th inch to 1/71th inch.  The printing shall be waterproof, visible through the adhesive coating and unaffected by the adhesive coating. A uniform coating of insect adhesive shall be applied to the shaded panels/areas as indicated on the attached drawing.  The amount of adhesive to be applied is ten (10) grams +/- gram.  The adhesive shall be applied in a manner within dotted lines of the designated area as shown in the attached diagram, and applied in a manner which prevents disposition outside of the designated adhesive area, so when folded the adhesive stays within the adhesive panels only. Following application of the adhesive, each trap shall be prepared for storage by folding in a manner that aligned the inside surfaces to prevent the adhesive coated surfaces from contacting non-adhesive surfaces.  As a result of PPQ service trials it has been determined that the only adhesives acceptable for use are: “Stickem Special Hold Fast Formula” or the “High Tack Formula” manufactured and distributed by:  Seabright Enterprises, LTD, 4026 Harlan Street, Emeryville, CA  94608  or “Tangle Trap” manufactured by The Tangle Foot company, 314 Straight Avenue S.W., Grand Rapids, MI  49504. Alternative adhesive materials are prohibited. (viii) Contractors wishing to submit a bid for this RFQ need to submit a sample, shipped separate from the actual quote, to the USDA location listed below.  Failure to submit a "Sample”, or failure of the bidders’ sample(s) to meet specifications, or submitting the actual bid (pricing) with the sample will render a bidder non-responsive and ineligible for award. The contractor sample(s) must include twelve (12) samples of each lot.  If all the 200,000 traps provided for USDA purchase will be from more than one lot you will need to provide a sample of 12 traps from each lot.  The sample(s) must be received at the following location by the date and time specified below for receipt of offers:  USDA, APHIS, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Attention:  Natalie Leva, Otis Plant Protection Center, Building 1398, Otis Air National Guard Base, MA  02542-5008. (ix) The provision at 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial applies to this solicitation.  (x) The provision at 52.212-2  Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.  Award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable responsible bidder whose quote conforms to this solicitation. The traps will be evaluated for technical capability as described in (vii) above.  Overall quality of the assembled trap will be evaluated.  Testing will include industry standard procedures described by the Technical Association of Pulp and Paper Industry, Incorporated as Method T-491 OM-85 and other tests designed to evaluate sizing, tensile strength, liquid hold-out, and weatherability of the paperboard product used.  (xi) The provision 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.  The contractor shall return a completed copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications with their quotation.   A copy of the provision may be attained from http://www.arnet.gov/far.  (xii) The clause at 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at Miami, Florida, has a requirement for medical services to be provided for international passengers entering the U.S.  The passengers are suspected of entering the U.S. with internal concealment of illegal drugs.  These services shall include a medical facility capable of offering on-site x-ray, radiographic evaluation, pregnancy tests for female suspects, medical examinations, and physician services available 24 hours per day.  The services also include internment of the patients with around-the-clock monitoring.  The facility must have life support capabilities for emergencies.  The facility shall be within a 10-mile radius from the Miami International Airport.  This is necessary for the CBP inspector’s safe, efficient, economical, and timely transport of the suspects.  In addition, the contractor must provide a designated lockdown area for confinement of each suspect and provide an area that will be used for installation of a drugloo machine provided as Government furnished equipment.  The performance period for the proposed contract has a one-year base period with option for four one-year renewals.  This is a proposed Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity type of contract.  For each fiscal year the minimum amount of each delivery order or services rendered will be $25,000.00, and the maximum amount of each order will not exceed $100,000.00.  The maximum amount of services to be rendered each fiscal year is estimated to be $440,000.00.  If all four options are exercised, for a five-year performance period, the minimum cumulative total of all orders issued will be $125,000.00, and the maximum cumulative total will not exceed $2,200,000.00.  This is a full and open competition and all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by this agency.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research to seek information from knowledgeable companies on the availability of commercial or modified commercial product and material solutions that will provide the capabilities needed to feed Marines in austere field conditions for extended periods utilizing the Unitized Group Ration-Heat and Serve (UGR-H&S).  The current system has reached the end of its life and is in need of life cycle replacement.  The required Tray Ration Heating System (TRHS) product must be transportable on either a Highly Mobile Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV/Humvee) or Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) and have the capability to prepare UGR-H&S while loaded on the bed of both of these vehicles.  The HMMWV must be able to transport at least one system and the MTVR must be able to transport at least 2 or more systems at one time.  All systems must be able to be secured to the vehicles, when operational and in ! transit by means of a tie down.  Required systems must be sufficiently small and lightweight so as to not require Material Handling Equipment (MHE) to load or unload the system (when empty) from either the HMMWV or the MTVR.  The required system must also operate in all climates and environments that Marines may encounter.  There cannot be significant degradations when ambient temperatures are above 0 oC (32 oF).  Systems must operate in all humidity levels to 100 percent and be resistant to the effects of salt water/spray and extreme sand and dust conditions to the extent outlined in Military Standard-810E.  The system must be capable of preparing sufficient hot UGR –H&S (A “hot” UGR – H&S is defined as being between 140 and 180 degrees Fahrenheit) to feed at least 250 personnel at a single site within a 90 minute period, calculated from the time of vehicle/system arrival at the site, through to include cleanup.  The daily system operation cycle is defined as preparing food!  for at least 250 personnel, twice each day or at least 500 meals per day per system.  The system must be able to operate between 2 to 12 hours a day and the average mission duration is expected to be 2-5 hours; therefore, each system must be able to operate for 5 continuous hours.  Each system must include fuel tanks that will supply enough fuel to complete an operational cycle of 500 meals per ration day.   The system’s method for delivering and storing heated rations must maintain the rations at serving temperature for at least four hours (threshold)/six hours (objective).  The serving temperature for cold items is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit and hot items at least 140 degrees Fahrenheit (threshold/objective).  The system must operate on JP-8, electrical power (DC and AC), or a combination of both; JP-8 will be the primary fuel.  The system must also be capable of receiving its electrical power for fuel ignition from two sources without having to be modified to accommodat! e those power sources.  The primary source will be the HMMWV or the MTVR vehicle's 24-volt DC electricity.  Additional sources must be conventional 115-volt 60 Hz AC field generators.  Cables and other interfaces for electrical power must be lightweight, uncomplicated, compatible with vehicle power/ports, and safe to use in all types of weather conditions.  The system must have a fuel-efficient heating system to minimize dangerous exhaust emissions, and be safe to operate while the transport vehicle (primary mover (HMMWV/MTVR) is in motion.  The system must provide automatic temperature regulation and have a manual override capability if the automatic system fails.

<DESC>"Technical and Scientific Support of Science Panel Reviews of major risk assessments for pesticide registration and re-registration for the Environmental Fate & Effects Division" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify any Small Businesses (SBs), Non 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), SBA 8(a) Program Businesses, Hubzone Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) and/or Women Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs)  that possess the necessary technical capabilities to provide technical and scientific support of Science Panel Reviews of major risk assessments for pesticide registration and re-registration for the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs/Environmental Fate and Effects Division (OPP/EFED).   EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) as required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996, is responsible for the regulation of pesticides through the registration, registration review and re-registration of pesticides.  OPP develops data requirements and guidelines for the conduct of studies by registrants that are used, along with other data and information, to assess the potential impact of the use of the pesticide on human health and the environment.   Before EPA can use studies and data in assessing risk, these data must be evaluated to determine their adequacy and validity and to ensure that appropriate quality assurance procedures were carried out.  Once data have been evaluated and determined to be acceptable and valid, these data are used to assess risk to human health and ecological resources.  OPP also convenes scientific workshops and seminars to discuss and resolve scientific issues associated with the registration, registration review and re-registration of pesticides. The purpose of this contract is to provide technical support to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances's (OPPTS), Office of Pesticide Program's (OPP) Environmental Fate and Effects Division (EFED) for technical meetings and technical workshops (excluding non-target plant issue workshop and general guideline workshops).    EFED has a Science Review Panel which reviews each ecological risk assessment and risk characterization chapter prior to its release to the risk management divisions.  These ecological risk assessments/characterizations are used to inform regulatory strategies and risk managers and become part of the public record.  It is imperative that the Science Review Panel have accurate records which are in explicate detail.  These records are used by the EFED risk assessor to revise the risk assessment prior to its distribution within and outside the division.  It also provides records for EFED for policy making and becomes institutional history on how risks to the environment are evaluated.   This contract will provide meeting support for the Science Review Panel and other technical meetings which require support.  This meeting support will provide detailed records of the Science Review Panel comments and input to revised risk assessments and detailed records for other technical meetings.  EFED also conducts workshops on technical subjects to discuss the relevant issues and to determine how experts in the field recommend these issues should be handled.  A workshop is one method to draw conclusions and to determine EFED's direction on handling and closing the issue(s).  Additionally, this contract will provide technical documents to help determine what the relevant issues are, to document workshop conclusions, to provide detail records of workshop activities, and to provide meeting logistics within a short time frame. Detailed information on the requirement is provided via a draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) and its associated appendices which are posted to the following web-page on or about April 14, 2005: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0511252/index.htm The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 with a size standard of $6.0 million for potential socioeconomic program businesses.  The current contract is a GSA schedule delivery order EP-05-W-000107 $118,213 for one year period ending 14 October 2005 with Syracuse Research Corporation (a large business under the applicable NAICS code) as the incumbent.

<DESC>Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP) Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Request for Information (RFI) Deployment and Articulation Systems for the High Gain Antenna and the Solar Array Overview The Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP) is a sequence of missions intended to perform measurements, technology demonstrations and infrastructure deployments to enable a successful human return to the Moon in the 2015-2020 timeframe.  RLEP consists of a sequence of (nominally) annual missions to the lunar vicinity.	Each mission will build upon the discoveries and emplaced infrastructure provided by previous missions.  The RLEP sequence begins in 2008 with the launch of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission will conduct measurement and investigations of the lunar surface and environment.  Primary objectives include high-resolution topographic mapping of the surface, characterization of the lunar radiation environment and investigation of potential in-situ resource concentrations.  LRO will maintain a 50 km lunar polar orbit for a period of 1 year following commissioning, with the potential for up to 4 years of extended mission in a low-maintenance orbit.	Possible extended mission scenarios include additional measurement collection and proximity relay cross-support for follow-on RLEP and international missions. High Gain Antenna Deployment and Articulation System (HGADAS) LRO requires communications to support tracking, telemetry and command (TT&C) as well as mission measurement data return.  To accomplish this LRO intends to employ S-Band for TT&C functions and Ka-Band for high rate measurement data.   The S-Band and Ka-Band antennas will be packaged together as one unit.	A 2-axis pointing/tracking mechanism is required to orient the antennas anywhere within a hemisphere.  The pointing/tracking mechanism and antennas will be mounted at the end of a boom, so that this hemispherical view is not obstructed by the spacecraft or any of its components (e.g., the solar array), and so that the antenna itself does not obstruct the field–of-view of the spacecraft instruments.  The antenna system will be folded against the spacecraft for launch to fit within the launch-vehicle fairing, and so that it can be properly supported during launch.  The antenna will be deployed soon after reaching orbit. Solar Array Deployment and Articulation System (SADAS) LRO will utilize a solar array to capture the Sun’s energy, convert it to electrical energy, and charge the spacecraft batteries.  A 2-axis pointing/tracking mechanism is required to orient the solar array anywhere within a hemisphere.  The pointing/tracking mechanism and solar array will be mounted at the end of a boom, so that this hemispherical view is not obstructed by the spacecraft or any of its components (e.g., the high-gain antenna), and so the solar array itself does not obstruct the field–of-view of the spacecraft instruments.	The Solar Array must be folded against the spacecraft for launch to fit within the launch-vehicle fairing, and so that it can be properly supported during launch.	The Solar Array will be deployed soon after reaching orbit. Spacecraft Information Information about the LRO spacecraft and subsystem requirements are detailed in the following attachments: 1.	LRO RFI HGAS and SAS Requirements 041205 2.	LRO HGAS Pointing Requirements Document 041205 3.	LRO HGA and SA Electrical Interfaces 040105 4.	LRO Redundancy Statement 040105 5.	LRO Mass Properties #E 2005-4-5 A CAD model is also available upon request in Solidworks, eDrawings, IGES, or STEP formats. Requested Response The LRO mission requests that interested parties provide inputs and suggestions as to how best to support, deploy, and articulate the LRO antennas and solar array.  Responses may include component or system level concepts including the boom-to-spacecraft deployment hinge, the boom, the support/deploy system, the hemispherical pointing mechanism, cable management, the antenna RF waveguide, and the supporting electronics.  The Project is interested to learn of individual component technologies as well as complete system concepts. The objectives of this RFI are: 1) to improve NASA’s knowledge of industry's capabilities; 2) to improve the overall understanding of existing options for restraint/deployment and 2-axis articulation of the LRO antenna and solar array; and 3) to invite industry to submit information that will allow NASA to assess the partnering opportunities that exist within industry to build these subsystems. Cost, schedule, mass, performance, simplicity of design, robustness, ease of ground testing, and minimum risk (heritage) are key discriminators in LRO’s eventual selection of any solution. The Project is very interested to learn of potential technology developments that could benefit LRO, RLEP and the Agency. To consolidate our planning, we request responses from industry by May 6, 2005, in the form of written and illustrated concepts, estimates for development cost and schedule -- for individual components as well as complete subsystems, assumptions used for cost and schedule estimates including interface and design assumptions, and descriptions of capabilities.  The subject line of the submission should be "RFI for Deployment and Articulation subsystems for the LRO High Gain Antenna and Solar Array,” and attachments should be in Microsoft WORD, POWERPOINT, or PDF format. The email text must give a point-of-contact and provide his/her name, address, telephone/fax numbers, and email address. The information is requested for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information for Planning Purposes." While our intent may be to team with industrial partner(s), we are not bound by this RFI to do so. It is neither a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI. Information submitted to GSFC in response to this RFI will be treated as strictly confidential unless otherwise indicated. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Technical questions should be directed to:  Giulio Rosanova at (301) 286-5907 or Giulio.G.Rosanova@nasa.gov.  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Julie Janus at (301) 286-4931 or Julie.A.Janus@nasa.gov.

CMS intends to operate several contact centers (to be called Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs)) that are accessed by a single toll-free telephone number (1-800-Medicare) and utilize a network Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, a standard desktop application, a national data warehouse, and centralized standards and approaches to core contact center functions, i.e. operating policies and procedures, quality assurance, training development, and content development, among others.  The BCCs will respond to general Medicare inquiries as well as inquiries about Medicare claims and services.  Besides responding to inquiries by telephone, the BCCs will also respond to written inquiries, including email and Webchat. 

In addition to (1) contact center operations (responding timely, accurately, and reliably to telephone and written inquiries, including mailroom operations, disenrollment transactions, and beneficiary access to personal information on the Web), CMS is seeking sources to perform in the following functional areas:  (2) system integration (enhancing interoperability between diverse systems, such as a standardized desktop, national data warehouse, quality monitoring application and applications services management), (3) software development  (developing and maintaining a standardized desktop and a national data warehouse), (4) performance management (measuring or increasing performance through training development, train-the-trainer delivery, content development, scripting development, development of standard operating procedures, national quality assurance, beneficiary satisfaction measurement, and qualitative performance metrics analysis; this also includes designing and maintaining a website for contact center users containing operating procedures, training materials, frequently asked questions, quality assurance information and other information needed to communicate to contact centers), (5) operations management (monitoring, managing, and reporting on network oversight, including a network operations center (call allocation changes, reporting, forecasting, scheduling, helpdesk)), and (6) print fulfillment (packaging and mailing static items and printing, packaging, and mailing print on demand items.)  Additional functions may be developed in the future to address the changing priorities of the Medicare program, evolving technology, and new customer expectations.  

Workload:  Between October 1, 2003, and September 30, 2004, (Federal Fiscal Year 2004), Medicare call centers handled almost 30 million beneficiary telephone calls, including general inquiries and claims inquiries.  Projected Medicare beneficiary telephone inquiries for Fiscal Year 2005 are 38 million.  Written inquiries received from beneficiaries in Fiscal Year 2004 exceeded 838,000.  Projected written inquiries for Fiscal Year 2005 are 1 million.  Workload for print fulfillment includes both static items and print on demand (POD.)  Static items include Medicare & You, and other preprinted handbook and brochure type items.  POD items include geographic-specific information about nursing homes, managed care plans, prescription drug cards and prescription drug plans.  The Medicare print fulfillment contractor mailed over 860,000 static items in Fiscal Year 2004 and over 1 million POD items.  Projections for print fulfillment are not available for Fiscal Year 2005, but volumes for both static and print on demand can expect to be higher. 

Performance Expectations – Contact Center Operations:  CMS expects that companies winning contact center operations contracts shall be able to handle ¼ to 1/3 of the total estimated call volume (38 million in FY 05) and shall also be able to ramp staffing up and down to handle the call spikes that have become commonplace for Medicare beneficiary call centers.  These spikes are in response to predictable CMS information campaigns, but also to news stories, press releases, breaking news, or other situations over which CMS has no control.  In some spikes, call volumes have exceeded 400,000 calls per day.  On average, regular weekday call volume exceeds 80,000.  In addition to the ability to handle unpredictable call spikes, contractors shall be expected to answer, as measured on a monthly basis, at least 80% of calls within 30 seconds with an abandonment rate no greater than 4%.  Companies shall also have the capability to operate 24 hours/day x 7 days/week.  For written inquiries, companies shall be expected to respond to 95% of written inquiries within 3 business days.  For both telephone and written inquiries, quality and satisfaction measures will need to meet or exceed 95% on CMS-provided quality monitoring and satisfaction tools. 

Performance Expectations – Print Fulfillment:  CMS expects that one company will win a print fulfillment contract.  This company shall have the ability to mail 95% of static and POD materials within 3 business days of request and ensure that 95% of all orders are accurate and complete.  Some requests will come in directly through telephone conversations with customer service representatives or through www.Medicare.gov, while some will need to be transcribed from IVR requests.  The company shall be able to maintain and store approximately 1 year’s worth of static publications (in excess of 800,000) and shall be able to generate and fulfill up to 6,000 POD requests per day.  For the POD function, CMS expects that the company will use an end-to-end custom book-building program which can automatically assemble specific XML data, gathered and created by the various Medicare decision tools (on www.Medicare.gov), and build on-demand personalized health care documents to be mailed directly to each requestor. The POD program shall be designed to be easily scalable to an unlimited (and growing) number of daily individual requests / orders.

Additional Performance Expectations:  Companies winning contracts can expect to be held accountable for meeting further performance standards for contact center operations and print fulfillment as well as specific performance standards developed for the other functional areas mentioned above.

Cost Efficiencies:  Companies shall be expected to provide service at a competitive price within the full spectrum of the contact center delivery market, while maintaining quality standards and satisfaction levels.  

While small businesses interested in documenting their capability to perform in any or all of the functional areas above should respond to this sources sought announcement within 15 days of its publication, we are particularly interested in small business capabilities in the area of qualitative and quantitative performance (e.g., training, content, scripting, quality assurance, beneficiary satisfaction, standard operating procedures, etc.)  The following specific information is requested: (a) company descriptive literature; (b) specific related corporate experience broken down by the functional areas mentioned above as applicable; (c) experience with meeting performance metrics and expectations, including information about the metrics met in previous or current contracts, and experience with the type of performance expectations mentioned above; (d) information about efficiencies in answering telephone and written inquiries (i.e., cost per minute experienced in previous contracts); (e) references (to include a point of contact and phone number)with first hand knowledge of the experience cited in (b), (c), and (d) above; and (f) an indication of whether the services to support such activities are customarily available in the commercial market and if so what are the customary practices, including pricing, discounts, warranties, etc. under which commercial sales of these services are made.  If applicable, indicate if your company is on a GSA schedule or holds a Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) relevant to the capabilities addressed in your response.  

It is essential that the contractor be free of all appearance of or actual conflicts, such as the operation or sale of managed care plans and/or prescription drug plans, Medigap policies, durable medical equipment, dialysis services or any other related product or service.  Specifically, the contractor must not have any relationships or arrangements through its business operations or its employees that could be considered as possibly lessening the company’s objectivity concerning any aspect of the referrals or information provided to the Medicare beneficiaries.  If such relationships or arrangements exist, contractors shall be required, during the procurement process, to identify potential conflicts of interest and discuss how the conflicts will be addressed and mitigated.

Specify the name and telephone number of a point of contact and indicate your size standard under the following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) (formerly known as the SIC code): 561421 – Telephone Call Centers (Size Standard: $6 million); 541512 – Systems Integration (Size Standard: $21 million); 541511 - Software Development (Size Standard - $21 million); 611430 – Training (Size Standard - $6 million); 541611 – Administrative Management and General Consulting Services (Size Standard - $6 million); 541511 – Web design (Size Standard - $21 million); 493190 -  Fulfillment (Size Standard - $21.5 million); and, 323115 – Print on Demand (Size Standard – 500 employees).  Additional information on NAICS codes can be found at www.sba.gov.  The purpose of this synopsis is to identify potential responsible small business sources only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The information that you provide will be evaluated to identify capable potential sources if funding is allocated for this effort.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for any information solicited.  Documentation should be sent to:  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Attn: Debbie Lester, Room C2-21-15, 7500 Security Blvd, Baltimore, MD 21244.  Questions may be referred to Debbie Lester at 410-786-5136.

<DESC>This is NOT a SOLICITATION and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is a sources sought notice FOR PLANNING PURPOSES only. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED from this synopsis. NO REIMBURSEMENT will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests. 

The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential suppliers of organic fertilizer, which can be used on future highway construction contracts. We are seeking manufacturers of sterilized, weed-free, slow release fertilizer, which works well in environmentally sensitive areas. This organic fertilizer must allow for the successful establishment of vegetation with low concentrations of nitrate in the surrounding groundwater. The low nitrate level will allow for the use of this product in wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas.  

This fertilizer shall have a nutrient release curve that closely resembles the release curve for a local soil’s organic matter.  This means the fertilizer will provide nutrients at a rate to which native plants are adapted and is less likely to favor the weeds that thrive under high rates of nutrient release.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT - The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking sources that could provide scientific research and engineering services in the analysis, evaluation, testing, and enhancement of NOAA satellite, meteorological, and oceanographic systems.  It is anticipated these requirements would be needed for a period of five years. These services are currently provided by Mitretek Systems, a nonprofit, 501(c)(3), scientific research and engineering corporation operating in the public interest.  Information pertaining to Mitretek is available at:  http://www.mitretek.org/home.nsf/BusinessAreas/OceansAtmosphereSpace.  A viable potential source shall have available staff, resources, and experience in meeting the Government’s needs in areas which include, but are not limited to:  satellite ground systems engineering, acquisition, and evolution; collection, interpretation and translation of NOAA observational requirements into the appropriate sensor systems; transition of research weather systems to operations; transition to higher satellite downlink data rates and lossless data product processing; RF Technologies to include X-Band, L-Band, and S-Band spectrum performance, utilization, and interference analyses, and 8PSK and 16QAM modulation technologies; data compression technologies; Biometrics and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) advanced access control and identification; integration of data from non-NOAA spacecrafts such as Metop, see (http://www.esa.int/export/esaME/ESAYA1094UC_index_2.html) and Jason, see (http://www.jason.org/jason_pdfs/adventures/aol_math/Content/credits.html) with NOAA data sources; improvements in scheduling of systems resources; accommodation of new instruments; constellation run-out and transition planning; system transition planning from old to new systems; operating systems analysis and planning; telecommunications strategies and utilization of advanced networks; associated services which apply developments to systems in the area of IT Security analysis, including applying NIST guidance for developing Certification and Accreditation (C&A) packages, Disaster Recovery/COOP planning; Doppler weather radar evolution; air quality forecasting; ocean engineering; hydrographic services optimization; remotely operated vehicles (ROV); satellite- and situ-based ocean observing systems; and planning and acquisition of fisheries information management systems. The contractor shall perform for NOAA essential evaluation and testing, and provide recommendations of new and existing technologies in the various areas described above. The Government requirements fluctuate and change as anomalies occur, priorities change, and technology advances. Therefore, the requirements cannot be precisely defined at the time of award.  As a result, the Government anticipates the issuance of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to meet this need. As an IDIQ the Government anticipates a minimum of $200,000 for the total period of performance. Work will be established on a time-and-material task order basis. Labor categories and fully loaded hourly rates will be negotiated prior to award as well as clarification of cost factors such as local travel, office supplies, and indirect rates that will be applied to these and other materials cost.  Indirect rates will be fixed in the contract. The anticipated maximum will be established at $75 million for the total period of performance of 5 years. In the past (20 years), the incumbent has provided a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 60 people as the Government’s needs fluctuated.  People have been provided both on-site and off-site.  A viable source must be able to manage the Government’s fluctuating need and level of expertise without losing critical knowledge based on prior development work. In addition, there is a strong potential for the selected contractor to be precluded from being considered for other NOAA awards.  For example, during the past two years, the incumbent was prohibited from the submission of proposals for requirements solely for NOAA, National Environmental Satellites, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) in the amount of approximately $260 million in acquisitions. This is due to the fact the contractor will need to have access to nonpublic information in the performance of this contract. This information includes other firm’s technical proposals, approaches, and documentation associated with supplies or services provided or to be provided to the Government. This information may provide the contractor for this requirement with a competitive advantage in a later competition for a NOAA contract. These situations would preclude the contractor from competing on the future requirement. The Contracting Officer will be the determining authority (See FAR 9.5). Since the contractor will have access to nonpublic information, a viable potential source must be able to confidently safeguard Government and other Government contractor information.  In addition, a viable source must be able to establish a level of confidence with firms so there will be an unencumbered exchange of information and working relationship between it and other firms.  The contractor shall grant to the Government full exclusive license to information first produced under the contract and all information pertaining to investigations and analysis shall be published by the contractor and made available to competing firms on a free of charge electronic method that shall be advertised extensively and intermittently throughout the period of performance of the contract. The contractor shall have no rights to inventions and discoveries other than those available to Government employees.  The Government will have rights to data first produced in the performance of the contract.  The contractor shall be restricted from incorporating proprietary data into products produced under this contract as a means of restricting release of these products.  In instances where this occurs, the act will grant the Government rights to the data as if it was first produced in the performance of the contract.  Interested parties must submit a written document identifing their viability as a potential source.  It shall address the requirements stated above and, at a minimum, provide the following: (1) a description of experience and capability to perform the services in each of the technical areas identified above, to include complex satellite ground systems; communications systems; weather radar and processing systems; ocean observation systems;  (2) a description of the approach to address the fluctuating level of efforts;  (3) a description of past experiences in which the source was able to successfully interact with a competing firm under conditions requiring a nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement and resolve a problem through cooperation; (4) a description of the approach to be utilized to distribute information on scientific and technical aspects developed under the contract that will enhance the marketplace and ensure equitable access to and awareness of such development, including an estimate of the cost for the advertisement and distribution of this information and the method of reimbursement (fixed-price, cost-plus); (5) information indicating concurrence and understanding regarding the limitation in competing for future NOAA acquisition and rights in data;  (6) information pertaining to past performance identifing three previous contracts of similar scope and complexity where services of this nature were provided (this experience shall demonstrate at least twelve months of actual experience providing services of this nature) over the last six years.  Identify the contracting agency, the contract number, the current contract obligation and total contract value, the date of award, the period of performance, and a contact person's (CO or COTR) name, telephone number, and email address, and if the approach described in responding to (1), above, reflects the teaming of multiple companies, the past performance information must address the successful performance of the described team, including any relationships among the team members.  Interested sources should also state their business size classification as it relates to NAICS code 541990 and whether they are interested in the capacity of a prime contractor.  The size standard is $6 million in annual average gross revenue of the concern taken for the last three fiscal years.  Small businesses interested as a prime contractor must describe how they will be able to meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-14, Limitation on Subcontractor, which states at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business.  Interested sources are also requested to provide information regarding any published or catalog price lists for labor categories relevant to the services. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this sources sought or Government use of any information provided. The Government will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments. Responses must be submitted in writing (two copies) and must include all information cited herein. Submission shall be mailed to:  U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA, NESDIS Acquisition Management Division, SSMC 3 – Room 10100/OFA 64, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 Attention: Linda H. Shariati.   Responses are due no later than 3:00 pm local time on May 13, 2005.  All interested parties may submit a response that will be considered by the Government. This notice seeking sources is not a request for competitive proposals. The information received may be used to determine an acquisition strategy and for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  See numbered note 26.

<SUBJECT>D -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) CONTRACT WRITING SYSTEMS
<DESC>The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is seeking information from industry on contract management systems.  The contract management system must support the needs of the full acquisition life cycle from purchase request to solicitation/amendments; contract award and modification; issuing delivery orders and modifications to delivery orders; contract administration, simplified acquisitions and contract closeout.  The contract management system may need to interface with Oracle Federal Financials and will interface with Federal Data Procurement System-Next Generation. The contract management system must have the capability to perform centralized collection and reporting of accurate and timely contract and financial data by contract line item and sub-line items with multiple appropriations.  The contract management system must be fully capable of supporting approximately 150 users at multiple sites.  The contract management system must support complex/hybrid contract types, complex funding and pricing arrangements and large numbers of contract modifications.

 	It is requested that interested parties provide a capabilities package to include: 1) product descriptions/specifications that will provide a partial or complete solution, 2) prior/current experience providing contract management systems to the Department of Defense within the last three years, including contract number, organization supported, indication of whether performance was as a prime or subcontractor, contract value and a Government point of contact with current telephone number.

	The information sought herein is for planning purposes only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for any information submitted by respondents to this RFI.

<SUBJECT>49 -- Industry Strategy Development Session / Support Equipment
<DESC>INDUSTRY STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT SESSION

The WR-ALC Support Equipment Commodity Council (SECC) will host an Industry Strategy Development Session at WR-ALC on 26 Apr 05. The goal of these sessions is to present information regarding the current data available on a 71-FSC group of items currently under evaluation by the SECC.  The items represent items that are currently coded with Acquisition Method Codes (AMC) identifying the items as competitive.  The available data on these items, which indicates the most recent three-year spend history and the current three-year forecast data can be viewed at: http://www.robins.af.mil/le/lek/default.asp. All available information regarding most recent contract award, projected buy quantities, estimated dollar amounts of the forecast, and other pertinent information is included in a spreadsheet for your evaluation.  You may obtain data on any of the items identified by contacting the WR-ALC Public Sales office.***  

Objectives of the strategy development day will be to solicit inputs from industry contractors who may have previously provided the items (either as a manufacturer or a distributor) to determine if there are competitive groupings of items that may make support of groups of items a viable business opportunity to industry.  Other potential methods of support may include the development of Third Party Logistics sources and the discussion of the types of contracts that may be employed.  Additional issues to be discussed will include the use of web-based ordering, overall reduction in paperwork processing for both the Government and the contractor, long-term contracts, flexibility in establishment of contracts that will allow expansion of items to be covered under contracts once contracts are awarded, inclusion of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) objectives, and various other methods of support of the items identified in the purview of the SECC.  The event will provide a unique opportunity for Government and industry participants to explore more innovative methods of support and ensure that the warfighter needs are met with improvements in timeliness, cost, and technology.***

The half-day sessions will be held in the Eagle Conference Room on the third floor of the WR-ALC Museum of Aviation Eagle Building on 26 April 2005.  There will be two sessions, the first from 8:00 – 11:00 a.m. and the second from 1:00 – 4:00 p.m.  There will be a limit of 30 people per session on a first come, first serve basis.  Participation is free.  Special invitation is extended toward but not limited to small businesses. You must register on the http://www.robins.af.mil/le/lek/default.asp website by COB 21 April (website available the afternoon of 15 April).  Opportunities for one-on-one sessions with SECC members will be scheduled on 27 Apr and the request must be indicated on the registration form.***

ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE GOVERNMENT IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY AND AT NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT.  The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Office of Border Patrol has evaluated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and found them to be a significant benefit to the mission of controlling the nation’s borders.  The UAVs will provide an additional detection capability and increase agent safety during apprehensions through improved situational awareness.  The UAV is not intended as a replacement for other Border Patrol systems; it will supplement them with its own unique capabilities.  The UAV operations are not designed to replace ground assets but to enhance their ability to detect, track, and apprehend undocumented aliens (UDAs), including possible terrorists, and to increase agent safety through increased situational awareness provided to the agents through direct imagery from the air.
CBP is interested in procuring and operating a UAV system(s) comprised of UAV airframe(s) and sensors, Ground Control Station (GCS), Sensor Control Terminals (SCT) and Remote Viewing Terminals (RVT).  CBP is seeking industry interest and information from sources that can provide a medium altitude long endurance UAV system(s), support equipment, air vehicle and sensor operators, maintenance personnel and support and systems integration support.   Initial operations are intended for the Southern Border of the United States.  CBP plans on conducting UAV operations 30 days after contract award and anticipates starting operations during the 4th quarter of FY 05.  Operations and maintenance support shall be month-to-month for a minimum of 224 hrs per month, with a potential for increased flying hours each month, above the minimum.  DATA/INFORMATION REQUESTED.  CBP is interested in obtaining industry comments on the draft system specification, program plan and schedule.  The written response should contain a point of contact for potential follow-up communication.  DELIVERY INFORMATION / POINTS OF CONTACT:  Please submit three copies of your response to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of Procurement, Suite 1310, ATTN: Sharon Lim, 1331 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, D.C. 20004.

Description of Work:  The purpose of the procurement is to supply, haul and apply an estimated 134 tons of Polymer Modified Emulsified Asphalt (HFE-90-IS or equivalent) for chip sealing on Forest Road 11 within the Sisters Ranger District on the Deschutes National Forest. (See attached vicinity map).Quotes to include distributor labor. Equipment:  The asphalt distributor shall be so designed, equipped, calibrated, maintained, and operated, that material may be applied uniformly on variable widths of surface up to 16 feet at readily determined and controlled rates from 0.05 to 2.0 gallon per square yard, with uniform pressure and with an allowable variation from any specified rate not to exceed 0.02 gallons per square yard.  Distributor equipment shall include a tachometer, pressure gauges, and an accurate volume measuring device or a calibrated tank.  Distributors shall be equipped with a power unit for the pump and full circulation spray bars that adjust laterally and vertically.  One hour will be allowed for distributor to refill from tanker.  Time in excess of one hour will not be counted for pay purposes.  Application:  Material shall be applied in a uniform, continuous spread. The distributor shall be moving forward at proper application speed when the spray bar is opened.  Any skipped areas or deficiencies shall be corrected.  Junction of spearheads shall be carefully made to ensure uniform coverage and smooth-riding surface. The product shall be applied only when the pavement temperature, in the shade, is seventy-five (75) degrees F. steady and rising.  The material shall not be applied when rain is anticipated within twenty-four (24) hours of application, or when weather is overcast or foggy. Contract start date will be negotiated as the weather becomes favorable for application. Desired contract completion date is July 15, 2005, weather permitting. Shipments:  Individual deliveries will be made by written, telephone, or verbal notice to the Contractor or the Contractors delegated representative, giving the time, place and quantity for delivery. All shipments will be called for by the Government in truck-transport quantities.  Drivers may be subject to a two (2) hour delay for unloading.  Vendor will be reimbursed at the standard demurrage costs for delays in excess of two (2) hours, unless delays are caused by the vendor.  (Vendor to provide the Government with a copy of their “standard” demurrage rates).  As there is no bulk storage on the Deschutes National Forest, a cancellation notice delivered at least 12 hours prior to scheduled delivery, shall be honored by the vendor.

List the on-site project managers experience and qualifications along with other onsite employee’s skills and experience performing similar work.  Price.  
These factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Offeror’s should address each item listed under the three factors, as these items will be the basis for best value determination for award.  All evaluation factors, other than price, when combined, shall be more important than price.  However, trade-offs among cost or price and non-cost factors shall allow the Government to accept “best value”.  The Government may issue orders to other than the lowest quote, waive minor informalities or irregularities in quotes received or elect to not award at all. The Government may issue an order on the basis of quotes as received, without entering into discussions with any Quoter’s.  Therefore, each initial quote should contain the Quoter’s best terms.  The Government is not obligated to request additional information, and in the absence of appropriate information, the Government may rely on personal knowledge of the firm.

Determining the chemical sequence of the DNA of pathogenic organisms is a critical first step in the development of diagnostics, vaccines and chemotherapeutics against deadly human pathogens.  A critical aspect of sequencing and processing of the data from multiple bacterial genomes is the use of servers and bioinformatics software to store, analyze and present genome data.  The RML currently has an  ERGO server on site for the processing, storing and presentation of bacterial pathogen genome data.  This RML ERGO server and the software that runs on it needs to be covered by a service and support contract to supply unlimited phone and email support, quarterly data updates, an ERGO gene expression module and a genomic data supplement.  The contractor shall provide to RML a 1(one) year License Renewal, including 4(four) quarterly data updates of existing genomic data, all new public genome data added to the ERGO database throughout the year, and proprietary customer data from any sequencing and annotation projects performed with Integrated Genomics.  Any software improvements to the core system shall also be provided at the time of update. This renewal includes unlimited phone and e-mail support from  experienced bioinformatics and software development teams.  Integrated Genomics shall include 8(eight) hours of web-ex based demonstrations and training.  Data files must be compatible, transferable to and readable by a contractor-supplied server with ERGO bioinformatics software and RML computing systems and infrastructure which involves PC, MAC and Unix/Linux-based systems.  The RML ERGO server consists of the ERGO Genome Analysis Suite. The contractor shall provide all personnel for the work effort. The contractor shall work closely with RML IT staff members to insure the server is properly updated and that RML IT guidelines and security measures are met. The contractor shall keep all NIH, RML-derived data secure and will not release, make public or maintain any of the RML data beyond this contract effort. If Internet connectivity is needed in order to perform the work, for transfer of files, or other efforts, contractor computers will be secure and in compliance with RML-IT security procedures and policies. Contractor supplied software shall be kept current and up to date with applicable security patches and upgrades.  Internet connectivity and/or remote access for the purpose of performing the work, for transfer of files, or other efforts, will be coordinated with NIAID IT staff to ensure security and compliance with NIAID IT procedures and policies.  The contractor shall provide to the RML Project Officer contact information for the Project Manager that will oversee the service support contract.  The Contractor shall produce/provide the following deliverables: l) Unlimited phone and email support for the RML ERGO server and software for one (1) year.  2) 4 (four) quarterly ERGO database upgrades for genomic data in the public domain, genomes already present on the RML ERGO server, and all genomes performed at RML The first quarterly updates shall be scheduled immediately upon receipt of the licensing fees and Rocky Mountain Laboratories shipping information.  Subsequent updates will be delivered at approximately 60 (sixty) business day intervals following the first update. This upgrade for all publicly available genomes shall be completely compatible with the infrastructure and format of the RML ERGO server.  Cross genome comparative analysis must be available, prediction of translation starts, sequence similarities, functional annotation, and orthologous cluster analysis.  Additional methods that rely on gene context rather than on sequence similarity must also be available for annotation of those genomes. 3) The ERGO gene expression module for integration of micro array data (spotted and Affymetrix chip data) into gene function and context pathways shall be available.  Inspection Criteria: All service and support will be inspected and approved by the Project Officer of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories via weekly reports and analysis of deliverables.
