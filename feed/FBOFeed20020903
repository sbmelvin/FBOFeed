<CONTACT>Deborah Fallick, Contract Specialist, Phone (770)488-2602, Fax (770)488-2670, Email DFallick@CDC.GOV
<DESC>D - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a draft request for proposals for the acquisition of information systems development and microcomputer support services. The contract is anticipated to be a single award, ID/IQ Task Order type contract with the flexibility to award cost plus fixed fee, fixed price, time and materials and labor hour task orders dependent on the scope of the statements of work associated with the task order.  The contract will not be a requirements type contract.  The period of performance is 7 years with an  anticipated basic period of performance of 12 calendar months from date of award with six one year option periods not to exceed 84 months.  The estimated number of hours for the effort is 9,079,000.  At the present time CDC is contemplating the contract will include programming services scopes of work which heretofore were small business set-asides in Cincinnati, Ohio and Morgantown, West Virginia, as well as the inclusion of the newly awarded, 2 1/2 year CDC-wide Microcomputer Support and Services contract also awarded as a total small business set-aside.  CDC will be requesting the bundling of these scopes of work from the Small Business Administration and pending their approval will issue the final RFP with these scopes included in the RFP.  The work under this contract is anticipated to consist of a variety of programming and microcomputer support services to CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) including various information systems technologies and computing platforms including mainframe, microprocessor workstation, and network server technologies including client-server applications.  Work involves information and data analysis systems in support of CDC's mission, including performing requirements analyses; design and development of new systems; ensuring information systems security; modification, maintenance and conversion of existing systems; data and database administration; training users in both CDC-developed and commercial applications; hot-line user support to application users including CDC staff and state and local health professionals throughout the U.S. in the use of CDC-developed applications; programming support for the analysis of scientific, statistical, and public health data; systems integration, data conversion, and data communications via networking and telecommunications between disparate systems and geographic locations; data entry and keypunch support; graphics and desktop publishing; and computer center facilities operation. Work to be performed also includes hardware repair and maintenance of Government microcomputer equipment; maintaining a spare parts inventory; software support including installation, integration, operation and user orientation; local and wide area network administration and support; problem diagnosis and tracking including maintaining a CDC-wide Help Desk; and video teleconferencing support.  Existing technology is primarily Pentium-based microprocessors and installed microcomputers run Windows 95 and NT which are connected to IBM token ring and Ethernet Local Area Networks (LANs) running Novell NetWare version 4.11 operating system (soon to be upgraded to 5.x).   CDC plans to migrate to Novell NetWare 5.x in the near future, and to Sonic ring in the next 12 - 18 months.  CDC's network topology is a combination of token ring over type 1 cable, FDDI over category 5 cable, and Ethernet over type 1 or category 5 cable.  Supported protocols are TCP/IP, IPX, and SPX and CDC interconnects to the Internet.  The LANs are connected together into a Wide Area Network (WAN) using multi protocol and high speed routers over fiber optic cable or leased data lines.  A broadband Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) interconnects all large Atlanta campuses.  Currently FDDI is the method used for the WAN.  Within a 12 -18 month period, the WAN will use ATM over T-1 and the MAN will migrate to an OC-48 network.  Offerors must be capable of repairing and maintaining equipment from a variety of manufacturers, i.e., Dell, Compaq, AST, SUN microcomputers, with a few MacIntosh.  Contract performance will be at CDC's primary offices in Atlanta, GA as well as in Washington, DC; Cincinnati, OH; Morgantown, WV; Hyatttsville, MD; and Research Triangle Park, NC, as well as in the contractor's facilities. Travel may also be necessary to other CDC sites such as Anchorage, AK; San Juan, PR; and occasional travel outside the United States. The draft solicitation will be available on or about August 31, 2000.  Only written requests submitted to the address shown above will be honored.  The date specified for receipt of questions/comments on the draft RFP will be approximately 30 days after the draft RFP issue date.  Requests for the draft RFP must cite RFP 2000-N-00120.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  It is anticipated that the final RFP will be issued January, 2001.  CDC will announce the industry day/pre-proposal conference schedule in another CBD notice.

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from IPG Photonic Corp., Oxford, MA 01540.  The Vegetation Index Lidar Experiment requires a laser transmitter that produces 10 watts of diffraction limited optical power in the red portion of the visible spectrum (660-670 nm) to be a viable measurement from space.  The recent development of high power (multi watt level) raman fiber amplifiers in the near infrared (1200-1600nm) offers an alternative that is inherently efficient, compact, and rugged.  IPG Photonics is the only source producing and selling commercial polarization maintaining fiber amplifiers capable of producing &gt;5 watts (37.5 dbm) of saturated output power in te near infrared.  IPG Photonics is the only company that has demonstrated lead in developing the highest power commercial raman fiber amplifier pumps to date.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 19, 2002.

<DESC>The General Services Administration intends to negotiate a sole source award for Code 4224 of SPAWAR System Center San Diego to Sarnoff Corporation. The contractor shall provide the following: twenty (20) Video Mapper Systems, which includes Video Abstraction Software, Video Abstract Viewer, Documentation, and 90 day Warranty for each.   Sarnoff Corporation, and their subsidiary company Pyramid Vision Technologies (PVT), is the only company that has been found to have the aerial mapping software systems required by Code 4224 of SPAWAR, specifically the PVT Aerial Mapper Software.  The PVT Aerial Mapper generates a series of video abstracts from a video sequence. Each video abstract summarizes one continuous segment of the video sequence. It includes a mosaic of the segment's video frames, and information about the tracks of moving objects detected in the segment. Mosaics are written as image files, and other information is written in the form of textual files. Both mosaicking and tracking are based on a process of aligning successive frames in the video sequence. Two frames are aligned by first searching for an optimal shift of one with respect to the other, then proceeding to solve for additional parameters describing rotation, scaling, and skew. The overall sequence is divided into segments at points where successive frames cannot be thus aligned, such as occurs when the sequence changes from one video sensor to another, or when the sensor pans rapidly across the scene. Very short segments are discarded, as they yield no useful mosaic or track information, while longer segments are processed further to produce mosaics and tracks.  If the video sequence is accompanied by metadata describing the location and orientation of the video sensor, that metadata is used to geographically locate the mosaics that are produced. The metadata is first synchronized with the video sequence by associating timestamps in the metadata with those in the video sequence. Then, where metadata is available for a particular video frame, it is used to establish one or more tiepoints between video frame locations and ground locations. Each mosaic is geographically located using whatever tiepoints are associated with frames lying within that mosaic. Optionally, PVT Aerial Mapper will split its input video and metadata files into pieces corresponding to the segments it finds in the video sequence, and output these pieces as new video and metadata files. The SIC Code is 7311/NAICS Code is 541511. All interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement. Capability statements shall include evidence that the firm has previous experience in providing this requirement. Please provide the statements via e-mail only to joe.pechinko@gsa.gov by September 11, 2002; 4:30 p.m. Local Pacific Time. This notice is not a solicitation nor is it a formal Request for Proposal. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In the absence of responses from firms that believe they have the capability to provide these services, GSA intends to negotiate with Sarnoff Corporation, c/o Pyramid Vision Technologies, Inc., P.O. Box 7957, Princeton, NJ 08543.

The shaded fuel break will be approximately 125 feet wide for a total length of 13,833 lineal feet (2.62 miles) on the ridge adjacent to King Peak Road.  The project begins at the intersection of West Rancho Road and King Peak Road and continues north along the ridge adjacent to King Peak Road to Horse Mountain Creek Trailhead.  The fuel break will be widened and maintained by selectively cutting existing vegetation with chainsaws and/or other hand tools.  All brush material will be cut.  Leave trees will be spaced approximately 15 feet apart and no trees greater than 10" will be cut.  All trees will be limbed proportionally to a maximum height of seven (7) feet.  All severed vegetative material will be chipped and scattered on or adjacent to the fuel break. The results of this treatment would be large well spaced trees providing a shaded canopy with the absence of understory vegetation. The contractor shall select a maximum of 150 stems of conifer (Douglas-fir and Redwood) and Hardwoods (Tanoak and Madrone) per acre conforming to minimum approximate 15 x 15 foot spacing and cut all competing trees and brush. Some areas may have insufficient conifer to make the stem count. Interested parties shall complete fthe Request for Quotation BAQ020023 at the website:http://ideasec.nbc.gov/ or contact Traci D. Thaler at (916)978-4529, Fax (916)978-4444 to obtain a copy of the Request for Quotation.  This announcement is being run concurrently with the Solicitation being posted.  All quotations must be received no later than September 25, 2002, 12:00 a.m. (PST).

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to award on a sole source basis under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with Mr. Barry Gardner, of the Gardner Photography 441 Sternwheeler Court Gaithersburg, MD  20877, for the acquisition of photographs for the 2004-05 edition of the Occupational Outlook Handbook for research in accordance with FAR Part 13, NTE 10,000.00.  Mr. Barry Gardner , has been selected as a sole source contractor already has provided high-quality photographs (digital images) for this edition of the Handbook and his experience and familiarity with our program make him uniquely qualified to perform this work.  In addition, the fee?$100 per photograph?is far less than fees included in bids submitted by other contractors in the past.  Furthermore, photographs for the 2004-05 edition of the Handbook must be completed by June 1, 2003 in order to allow sufficient time for the composition and printing of the publication.  Meeting this deadline would be extremely difficult for any other photographer.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for offers.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All interested parties may express their interest to the Contracting Officer by the due date of this notice of intent either by e-mail, or facsimile at 202-691-6026.  If there are no affirmative written responses received within (15) calendar days from the published date of this notice, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will proceed with the awarded.  This notice is for information purposes only.  No solicitation will be available.  Correspondence must reference this notification number.


This statement of work is associated with a requisition for 100 professional-quality digital photographs in color, using 5 megapixel or higher digital camera.  Photos should depict workers in various occupations, to be published in the 2004-05 edition of the Occupational Outlook Handbook, the Federal Government?s premier career guidance publication.  A few sample photographs from the Handbook are attached.  A copy of a previous edition of the Handbook, showing the desired results, can be provided.  A reference copy of the Handbook is available in many libraries and school counselors? offices throughout the Nation.  

Occupational photos taken for the Occupational Outlook Handbook should capture the uniqueness of the particular occupation portrayed. Photos should be realistic, at-work shots that show workers actively engaged in tasks typical of their occupations.

Photos should project a positive image of U.S. workers. Images should reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of the Nation and workforce and should include  both men and women in approximately equal numbers. To that end, the following portrayals are desirable, whenever possible:

?	Women in occupations in which they have not traditionally held a large share of jobs, such as 	scientists, engineers, and construction craft workers. 
?	Men in occupations in which they have not traditionally held a large share of jobs, such as 	secretaries, nurses, and elementary school teachers. 
?	Members of racial and ethnic minorities in professional, managerial, and technical 	occupations. 
?	Workers with disabilities in a variety of occupations. 

In addition, no depiction of workers should include violations of Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations regarding safety in the workplace. Examples of violations include failure of workers to wear safety garb, such as hard hats at a construction site and latex gloves in most medical settings.

Photographs must be made on location in actual work settings that illustrate?in a non-posed fashion?typical workers in specific occupations.  The subject of each photograph should reflect a contemporary environment, including clothing, hair style, equipment, and work procedures.  The work area should be as clean and uncluttered as possible and, as indicated above, free of safety and health hazards.  Group photos should be taken where appropriate to the work being performed.

BLS and the photographer must agree on a price  per photograph.

Photographer must make his/her own appointments.  A release form, which is attached, must be completed at the time of photographing to obtain permission from the subject(s) to use the photographs for various publications.  Also, photos must not be for "one-time use" only because it is not uncommon for BLS to use a single photo multiple times. 

Ten digital images for occupations selected from the attached list must be submitted for approval.  If photographs submitted are not acceptable or recordkeeping requirements are not met, the right is reserved to cancel this procurement and to pay only for work performed.  If the ten photographs submitted are approved, the procurement will proceed.  The ten photographs initially submitted for approval are to be considered as part of the first increment.  

Photographer will submit different views and/or poses of each subject in both horizontal and vertical formats, and one digital image that, in the viewpoint of the photographer, aesthetically best illustrates the assignment.  BLS, for editorial reasons, however, reserves the right to select any image.  Photos will be paid for according to the agreed upon pricing schedule and become the property of BLS.

Each photograph must be labeled to specifically identify the name of the occupation and the name of the firm where the photo was taken.  Upon completion of all work, the photographer will submit a list of these firms in alphabetical order.

This project is to be completed by June 1, 2003.  Work should be submitted to BLS in several increments, according to a schedule agreed upon between BLS and the photographer.  At any point, if photographs are not acceptable or if the schedule is not met, BLS reserves the right to cancel this arrangement and to pay only for work performed.

The BLS contact is Chester Levine, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Postal Square Bldg., Room 2135, 2 Massachusetts Ave. NE., Washington, DC 20212.  Phone: (202) 691-5715.  E-mail: levine_c@bls.gov

The list of occupation titles for which photos will be included in the 2004-05 edition of the Occupational Outlook Handbook is attached.  Occupations for which we have photos or digital images from a previous contract are described in the right column titled ?Photos Completed are Described?.  The few occupations that are highlighted on the table below have been added since the previous contract.  The list of occupations for which photos will be needed is subject to change, and the BLS will work closely with the photographer throughout the course of the contract. 
Delivery shall be 25 days ARO. FOB Destination - Washington, D.C.  The point of contact for all information is Etihun Hailemichael, Purchasing Agent, at the address and phone number listed above. If your response is not received by the date/time and at the location specified in the announcement, it will not be considered.  Offerors may download the solicitation accessing the FedBizopps website at www.fedbizopps.gov. All future information about this acquisition will also be distributed through the FBO site.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to award on a sole source basis under Simplified Acquisition Procedures NTE $30,000 with Dixie Sommers of The Ohio State University, College of Education, 1900 Kenney Road, Columbus, OH. 43210. Ms. Sommers has been a critical guide for the BLS Workforce Governing Board as it has mapped its strategic plan and related activities. Ms. Sommers facilitated and served as a consultant to the Governing Board while it developed its Human Resources Strategic Plan. Ms. Sommers also facilitated the Workforce Governing Board retreat that helped the Board redirect and refocus its efforts in these activities.

These services are not available from public sector sources. It is the intention of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to procure these services from the appropriate private sector vendor.

Description:

This project will assist the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in establishing measures for tracking progress in its strategic human resources activities. 
The project is part of implementing the goals in the Bureau??s Human Resources Strategic Plan, which include recruitment, retention, mission alignment, staff development, and evaluation and continuous improvement. The project will assist BLS in establishing quantitative measures to track and evaluate its progress in achieving the strategic goals and the related activities. Establishing such measures is inherent in one of the goals of the Plan, "Evaluation and Continuous Improvement." 
The identification, production, and regular review of measures of progress will assist BLS in evaluating the status and effectiveness of the activities being undertaken to achieve strategic goals, and will provide a mechanism for identifying problems and opportunities for improvement. The project will focus on measurement related to the strategic activities in the Plan, rather than on day-to-day process measures. While the latter types of measures can be quite useful in improving performance of the agency??s human resource functions, they are not the means for monitoring progress toward achieving the strategic goals.
The approach, deliverables, and budget and contract period are described below, followed by information on the capabilities of the investigators. 


I. Approach

1.	Identify an initial list of measures for Goals 1 through 4 in the Human Resources Strategic Plan.
?h Review academic and practitioner literature for principles and examples of strategic measures. 
?h Review the Plan for examples of measures. 
?h Obtain input from key BLS staff through a question and answer process. 
?h Prepare the initial list.
2.	Review the initial list of measures with key BLS staff to identify their appropriateness and feasibility.
3.	Prepare recommendations on specific measures, including specification of the measures as to time period, coverage, and level of detail (e.g., by national office/regional office, offices within national office, detail by job classification). 
The investigators will work with key BLS staff throughout the project, including videoconferences and on-site visits. This consultation will be particularly import and during the development of the initial list of indicators, and review of the initial list leading to the final recommendations.


II. Deliverables

The project deliverable will be a report describing the recommended specific measures and their specification. The report will include a description of the recommended measures, and a summary of the results of the literature review. The final report is due on April 20, 2003.

III. Performance of Performance:

The contract period will be from September 17, 2002, through April 20, 2003.

CONTRACT INFORMATION: Up to two Indefinite Delivery Type contracts may be awarded at staged intervals for a base period of one year and may include two additional one-year option periods.  The total value of the two contracts shall not exceed $6,000,000. Fifty (50) percent ($3,000,000) of the total capacity for the two contracts will be awarded to a small business provided a small business responds with a submittal meeting the requirements of the acquisition as stated in the following paragraphs of this no tice.  The contract amount will not exceed $1,000,000 in any single calendar year.  The base period is one year and each option period will not exceed one year. The option periods may be exercised when the contract amount for the current period has been re ached or nearly reached. Minimum contract guarantee amount is two (2) percent of the capacity of the contract for the base year and one (1) percent of the capacity for each option period.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. Tas k Orders will be issued from time to time as the need arises during the contract period.  The amount of the Task Orders will not exceed the contract amount in any period.  All contract options may not be awarded if not supported by sufficient workload. Types of services required will include site investigations, studies, reports, concept design, final design, and construction phase services.  Allocation of task orders from among firms with IDT contracts for similar work will be based on one or more of th e following factors: specialized knowledge or expertise which would significantly benefit a specific customer or enhance execution, past experience with a specific customer or knowledge of the locality, availability of appropriate staff, performance on pre vious task orders, magnitude of task order relative to remaining contract capacity, and equitable workload distribution. If a large business is selected for this project, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work that it intends to contract.  This plan is not required with this submittal.  The subcontracting  goals for this contract are that a minimum of 61.2% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB), 9.1% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), and 4.5% be placed with women-owned small businesses (WOSB) . PROJECT INFORMATION: Task orders under this contract will consist primarily of design for new, addition, and remodel of facilities including (but not limited to) administrative, operations, training, maintenance and production, medical, and housing and com munity improvements.

Finally, task orders will include requirements for facility-related sp ecial designs including fire protection, underground storage tank removal/replacement, interior design (CID/SID), asbestos/lead paint removal, and Energy Management Control Systems (EMCS).  Construction cost estimates may be required for any of the design tasks listed above.  Work will be primarily located within the geographic boundaries of the Northwestern Division, but may be anywhere in the U.S. subject to higher headquarters approval. It is likely that use of the metric system of measurement may be required for some deliverables under the proposed contract; however, metric system experience is not a selection criterion and is not required for selection. Construction cost estimates will be prepared using the Corps of Engineers Micro-Computer Aided Cost Estimating System (M-CACES) Gold version.

<DESC>NA United States Army, Robert Morris Acquisition Center, White Sands Contracting Division, White Sands Missile Range, NM is awarding a Sole Source fixed-priced type contract for one year plus four (4) option years, for Meal Service.  The base performance peri od is 1 October 2002 through 30 September 2003.  The North American Industrial Classification Standard is 722310.  White Sands MWR Community Club will provide meal service.   In 1997, the WSMR Commanding General closed the existing consolidated dining facility due to a decline in the number of military personnel at WSMR.  The facility was in need of renovation at that time and has not been utilized for troop feeding since.  The White Sands Missile Range MWR Community Club is not an independent contractor  it is a Non Appropriated Fund Instrumentality of the United States Army.  Use of the MWR Community Club is authorized at remote installations such as White Sands Missile Ra nge.      WSMR is located in an isolated area.  It is not economically feasible to maintain a separate dining facility to provide meal services to authorized military personnel.   Note 22.

<DESC>This is an industry day announcement for the Block 10 Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) program. The purpose is to present the Block 10 migration strategy for the AF DCGS and the current ESC plan for the Block 10.2 Program. ESC/SRHG would like to invite interested industry representatives to participate in an AF DCGS industry day to be held 16 September,2002, at the ESC Conference Center, Hanscom AFB, MA. The industry day will be divided into two parts. Open session, 16 September 2002 (0800-1130), during this session the government will brief an AF DCGS overview, the overall AF DCGS architecture, the envisioned block migration capability increments, and the current AF DCGS Block 10.2 development/ fielding plan (acquisition/ approach, and notional schedule). All interested parties are invited to attend. Participation is limited to 6 attendees total from each contractor, which includes both prime and team member attendees. Individual face-to-face discussions 16 September(1300-1500). After 1500 to be held in Building 1102C, Rooms 118, 223, and SECRET in Room 148. Appointments are for 30-minute blocks and will be scheduled in advance. An appointment must be requested before industry day. Preference for the appointments will be based on distance traveled. During these sessions the government block 10 team will meet one-on-one with individual contractors. This will provide you with the opportunity to ask focused questions regarding AF DCGS Block 10.2 as well as identify/discuss any on-going or completed efforts, which you feel may be relevant to AF DCGS requirements. The AF DCGS is a "system of systems" capable of receiving processing, storing, exploiting, correlating, and disseminating national, theater, tactical, and commercial reconnaissance intelligence to support Air Force (AF) consumers. The AF DCGS migration effort will achieve the multi-INT and distributed capability described in the AF DCGS Operational Requirements Document (ORD. It will allow the analyst and decision-maker anywhere in the world to share the right Information in real time, AF DCGS Block 10 starts the migration to the overall goal of a mult-discipline tasking, processing, exploitation and dissemination environment. The AF DCGS Block 10.2 program effort will provide an integrated multi-intelligence Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capability including: multi-source And multi-platform integrated situational awareness picture, collaborative connectivity with Analysts, mission managers, and war fighters, transformed information dissemination using Web based technology, as well as, a next generation line of sight relay capability. This multi-discipline tasking, processing, exploitation and dissemination environment will be implemented on a common and adaptable infrastructure based on Commercial Off The Shelf(COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) components with the following capabilities: The system will manage all sources of information in a tiered integrated information management structure that includes a repository layer, process layer, and viewer/application layer. The Repository Layer will contain all information storage; the Process Layer contains all information query, conversion ,fusion, and manipulation engines: the Viewer Layer contains all elements of user interface and presentation. Object oriented transport infrastructure will connect each layer. All system components will affix metdata tags to all data with time stamps, reference to information sources, information processing pedigree, geographic reference, and target reference. The system will provide an integrated information management process employing the metadata tags to associate all data within the system. The integrated information management process employing the metadata tags to associate all data within the system. The integrated information management process will employ a platform and application independent user interface. Collaboration will exist at the information object level, involving the dynamic access and manipulation of information at geographically separate areas. The AF DCGS Enterprise will exist over the DCGS PED (processing, Exploitation, Dissemination) Architecture (DPA)which includes a high speed Wide Area Network (WAN). The system will provide a mission management capability that can distribute planning, tasking, and management services over the DPA and C4I networks. Automated interfaces are required to national and tactical external tasking sources. A Distributed Sensor Planner that can simultaneously plan and monitor multiple ISR collectors is integrated with these efforts. This capability will include interface to AF DCGS AFFOR sites and the Air Operations Center. A system will operate in a multiple security level environment to ingest, process, store, and disseminate mult-INT, multi-source data. The levels involved include unclassified, collateral, SCI, and allied/coalition force releasable data. A key feature of the system will be the development of a High Speed Imagery Guard between the imagery processing and sensor control components at the Low Level, and the NITF storage system and Distributed Sensor Planner at the High Level. This High Speed Imagery Guard must be capable of handling three simultaneous feeds from CIP and other sources at real time mission data. The system must be accreditable in accordance with DCID 6/3 (Director of Central Intelligence Directive). DCID 6/3 provides uniform policy guidance and requirements for ensuring adequate protection of certain categories of intelligence information (hereinafter intelligence information) that is stored or processed on an information system (IS). An information system is defined as any telecommunications and/or computer related equipment or interconnected system or sub-systems of equipment that is used in the acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of voice and/or data (digital or analog); it includes software, firmware, and hardware. The AF DCGS Situational Awareness and Multi-INT environment will be a collection of services that will provide all users with common access to data, processing, and fusion services. These data and services will provide the basis for situational awareness, multi-INT products. The situational awareness function will combine various near real time reporting sources into a single integrated picture. This function will be used to support mission management as well as the multi-INT reporting and fusion elements. Layered GIS products will be generated by a number of data repositories, some containing historical data and some containing real time information. The AF DCGS Next generation Line of Sight (LOS) Data Relay capability will include: Updating the two existing AF DCGS LOS data relay systems, known as MOBST (Mobile Stretch), to include the Common Imagery Processor (CIP) and Data Dissemination Group (DDG) as well as the existing Data Link, SATCOM, and radio components. Building, testing and fielding a third LOS Data Relay Updating the Extended Tether Program (ETP) to the new Link Relay standard outlined above Link Relay Standard. To support differing mission requirements, no single hardware configuration will support all users, but wherever possible, workstations will conform to a standard "core" configuration. To the greatest extent  possible, "thin client" configurations will be used. This will be implemented in two ways. First, web-based applications will be used to the maximum extent possible. For non-web based applications, the software will reside on an application server, with clients on the workstations, or applications being downloaded onto the work-stations. Whenever possible, dissemination will be done via the AF DCGS Web portal, a secure web based interface that provides a single point of nitration for access to information, applications, and services for all customers of AF DCGS. It provides the integration point for applications and information within the AF DCGS enterprise. Users will be able to select what appears in their view within certain role-defined constraints. This includes subscription and notification capabilities that control how information is delivered to users. In addition, the portal will provide directory and indexing capabilities to automatically manage the information stored within the AF DCGS enterprise. Users will also have search capabilities to locate information. Publishing tools will automate the process by which information is made available to users. From a security perspective, the Web Portal will exist behind a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) to provide user access, while still meeting the security Requirements of DCID 6/3. The system must be able to operate in a standard office conditioned environment housed in either racks, operating transit cases, non-operating transport cases, or just on table tops. The exact configurations will depend on specific user requirements. The system will be capable of deployment by air, rail, ship or road. The system must be able to operate from standard commercial or military generators. The system will be operated by USAF personnel, and shall be maintained by combination of USAF personnel with assistance contractor field service representatives when necessary. Submitting a response to this notice. Participation in the AF DCGS Industry Day is voluntary. The conduct of the AF DCGS Industry Day and/or the information presented herein will not obligate the Government in any manner. The Government will not reimburse the Industry Attendees for any costs associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with is event.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Contract Action.  The Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB CA. (AFFTC) intends to award a sole-source, 5-year, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to L-3 Communications, Telemetry East Division, 1515 Grundy?s Lane, Bristol PA. 19007, for the following: 102 (estimated) SP10-68 units; and 20 (estimated) PMF 6-68, pre-modulation filters. The contract will also have CLINs for Upgrade/Enhancements and Maintenance/Repair. The model SP10-68 is a complete Telemetry Data Encryption unit designed primarily for aircraft flight test use. It is compatible with existing KUTA or THORNTON class equipment and will accept the Crypto Key Fill from COMSEC fill devices such as the KOI-18 and KYK-13. The unit operates across the Plain Text domains and is characterized for TEMPEST requirements. It provides the necessary support power for the PCM Encoder Data Source, as well as the associated Telemetry Transmitter. The SP10-68 contains an encryptor plug-in module that allows for removal and/or replacement of the encryptor assembly. A plug-in Crypto Key Hold Battery and status lamps are visible to the user. Other functions include provisions for erasing the Crypto Key, automatic disabling of the Telemetry Transmitter Power during the Crypto Key fill operation, and filtering of the encrypted output signal suitable for transmission. The SP10-68 performs four main tasks: electrical isolation of the transmitter, and PCM data acquisition circuits from the primary power supply and from each other; power line conditioning for the PCM data acquisition source and the telemetry transmitter; encryption and buffering of the flight data according to the pre-selected Crypto-Key; and pre-modulation filtering or conditioning of the transmitted data for optimum bandwidth requirements. Features of the SP10-68 include: unit automatically adjusts to frequency of input data; 10 Amperes power for black; 6 Amperes power for red; transmitter power inhibit during key fill operation; key verification indicator lights; manual key zero pins available on J1 connector; cockpit display status lamp driver (NO KEY) available on the J1 connector; pre-modulation filter amplitude automatically adjusts to fixed linear frequency vs. amplitude curve; accepts input NRZ-L, clock; 100 KHz to 5 MHz; NRZ-L data, and clock inputs may be jumper selected for single-ended or differential (RS-422) operation; outputs: differential (RS-422) encrypted NRZ-L and clock outputs; filtered encrypted NRZ-L; pre-modulation filter amplitude sets to mid-scale (zero volts for bi-polar output) with no key load to allow for transmitter carrier check; and field replaceable hold batter for key backup during power-down. The NAICs code is 33422 and the size is 750 employees. Contractors must be certified by the National Security Agency. Qualified contractors must submit clear and convincing documentation that fully defines their capability to meet the requirement.  Documentation that fails to provide the required capability documentation will not be acknowledged.  Telephone requests to be placed on the mailing list will not be honored.  See Numbered Note(s):  22. This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals period. The government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational Epidemiology Branch (OEB) plans to procure services from Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, 1730 Minor Avenue, Suite 1600, Seattle, Washington 98101 for a Pilot Study of Medication Use and Risk of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma and Barrett=s Esophagus. The supplies and services herein are non-commercial as defined in FAR Part 13, are being procured in accordance with simplified procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees. The Occupational Epidemiology Branch plans to examine the association between medications that relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett=s esophagus. The analyses must address the following public health questions: i) the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett=s esophagus related to the use of specific medications, ii) the risk associated with the use of combinations of such medications, iii) the dose-response relations in terms of both duration of use and prescribed dose, and iv) the associations between esophageal adenocarcinoma and certain medical conditions potentially on the causal pathway, such as Barrett=s esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Previous studies that examined the relationship between medication use and esophageal adenocarcinoma relied on self-reported medication use information, which is subject to both differential and nondifferential misclassification. To overcome the limitations associated with self-reported data, new analyses must use accurate, objective, and detailed medication use data (including prescribed dose, frequency of prescription refills, and duration of use) in conjunction with detailed information on the cancer and other medical conditions of interest. Minimum Requirements: 1) Contractor must have access to large study population of at least 500,000 men and women with prepaid health care, with detailed prospective data on prescription medication use, selected medical conditions, and cancer outcomes. This data must be available for epidemiologic analysis; 2) have sufficient power to assess the relationship between individual medication use and risk of esophageal Adenocarcinoma; 3) the study needs to have detailed long-term computerized data on medication use, and that data must be linked to patients diagnosed with esophageal Adenocarcinoma and other medical conditions being examined and; 4) Contractor shall be familiar with the epidemiologic analyses required, and for interpreting the results.  Group Health Cooperative is the only source known to NCI that can meet the above specifications.  NCI is familiar with the sources of such cohorts and data within the United States and believes that Group Health Cooperative is uniquely capable of efficiently providing the required number of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett=s esophagus cases as well as the necessary exposure and disease information. This collaboration will further promote the goals of the NCI-CRN Cooperative Agreement, which is intended to foster such collaborations. Results of this pilot study are necessary to determine the feasibility of a larger, more extensive study additionally incorporating abstraction of medical records at this or other CRN sites.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on September 10, 2002.   If you have and questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at  holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number RFQ-026-4384-02 is issued as a request for quotations and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 01-07.  This procurement is set aside for small business.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business size standard is 500 employees. USDA, ARS has a need for a liquid chromatography system to purify enzymes and proteins from plant tissues such as developing soybean seeds and leaves, and to purify synthetic peptides produced in the laboratory.  This system must include the following characteristics: 1. Ability to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, and hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity (in the case of enzymes). 2. Depending upon the column used, flow rates may range from 0.05 to 20mls/min at pressures ranging from 0-700 psi. 3. The system must be capable of generating very precise, shallow gradients.  In most cases, this requires a  two-pump gradient system with dynamic mixing. 4. The entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides.  5. The system pumps should allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure compatibility with standard low pressure chromatography supports often used in affinity chromatography. The system must also have a definable pressure limit system, which will stop the pump and generate an audible and visual warning, in the event pressure exceeds the preset limit. 6. The controller must allow programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based. 7. The system should include a fraction collector which is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software. 8. The pumps, UV and conductivity monitors, valves and fraction collector must all be specified for use in a cold room at 4  C. 9. The system must include one automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, and wash positions), which will allow for sample loading onto the column. 10. We also require that the controller allow the user the option of including in his/her chromatographic methods programs, commands which will automatically reduce the flow rate if an over-pressurization occurs as sample is being applied or eluted from the column. Additional variables which should also be programmable to trigger sub-routines (e.g. new tube on fraction collector; valve changes; etc.) should include UV or conductivity signals. 11. The controller should turn off the pump flow when a signal is received from the fraction collector indicating there are no tubes remaining, so that valuable sample is preserved. 12. Installation and training must be provided by the vendor.Delivery is required within 8 weeks of award. Delivery is  FOB Destination to Raleigh, NC. Descriptive literature showing the quoted item meets or exceeds all specifications included herein must accompany the quotation . The government anticipates award of a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsive/responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most price advantageous to the government.     PAYMENT: Any award made under this solicitation is subject to 31 CFR Part 208 which requires all payments made by the government to be made by electronic funds transfer.  Vendors may meet this requirement by acceptance of government purchase card or providing a Vendor Express Number. If a company has not previously enrolled in the Vendor Express Program with USDA, they should call the National Finance Center at 1-800-421-0323 for an enrollment package.   All offers must include with their quotation  a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3.   The following FAR clauses apply:  Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number, 52.204-6;  Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, 52.212-1; Evaluation of Commercial Items awarded to a responsive/responsible offeror at a fair and reasonable price, 52.212-2; Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, 52-212-3;  Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-4.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Integrated Manufacturing Technology Initiative, Inc. (IMTI) to provide services to update the baseline Capital Projects Technology Roadmap to address technological issues and solution paths related to homeland security and economic development.  Additionally, IMTI will facilitate the creation of a detailed plan to conduct the necessary R&D and deploy the resulting solutions.  It is believed that this sole source is justified based on IMTI's investment and knowledge in the creation of the Capital Projects Technology Roadmap, their possession of proprietary methodology and data that is critical to the success of the effort, and their unique and broad base of experience and expertise.  IMTI has facilitated the gathering and information and created the Capital Projects Technology Roadmap and is uniquely positioned to extend that roadmap.  

The project is structured around four (4) tasks:  Workshop Preparation and Planning, Roadmapping Workshop and Update, Implementation Planning, and Executive Review and Teambuilding.  These tasks include research into the topic of homeland security and how it relates to the construction/capital facilities industry, conducting a three-day workshop to solicit input for the homeland security extension to the current baseline roadmap document and move the Capital Projects Technology Initiative toward implementation, convening a small group of experts to take the technology roadmap to the next level of detail, and convening a workshop involving a select group of top-level executives from the construction/capital facilities industry to review the roadmap and project plans and begin the process of building the required constituency for action.

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about September 18, 2002.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Statistical Research and Applications Branch (SRAB) plan to enter into a sole source contract with Istituto di Ricerche sulla Poplazione e le Politiche Sociali, Via Nizza 128-00198 Roma, Italy for the continued services of Dr. Anna Gigli and Dr. Riccardo Capoccacia. The SRAB is working on a complete Prevalence project.  Complete Prevalence represents the proportion of people alive on a certain date who previously had a diagnosis of the disease, regardless of how long ago the diagnosis was made. The NCI's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program has incidence data from 1973 through 1999.  Cancer prevalence estimates based on the counting method applied to SEER incidence and survival data allows for the estimation of prevalence for people diagnosed up to 26 years (limited duration prevalence). The completeness index methodology can be used to calculate complete prevalence by estimating the proportion of patients diagnosed prior to 1973 and adjusting the limited duration prevalence.
The initial project (263-MQ-117231) provided expertise with development of variance formulas for the completeness index factor and estimated the parameters of the incidence and survival models in order to calculate the completeness factor for 23 cancer sites. During the research several issues emerged that are important for the calculation of complete prevalence.  One is the estimation of complete prevalence of childhood cancers.  The SRAB is interested in improving and enlarging the list of complete cancer prevalence estimates.  The objectives of this project are: 
1) develop methodology to estimate complete prevalence for childhood cancers. Provide prevalence estimates of childhood cancers for all cancer sites, brain and leukemia by race (all races, white, blacks and Hispanics) and sex (males and females); 2) provide input parameters for cancer sites, males and females, all races; 3) Provide validation of the input parameters for specific age groups.  Dr. Anna Gigli and Dr. Riccardo Capoccacia, statisticians are the leading experts in the development of the methods and application for estimating chronic diseases incidence and prevalence as well as the variance estimates for these quantities.  They are unique in that they are: 1)  affiliated with the organization that developed the methodology and have extensively applied it to cancer data from Italy, Europe and SEER; 2) have knowledge and expertise gained through initial and continued development of methodology to estimate complete prevalence; 3) are essential to developing the methodology to estimate complete prevalence for childhood cancers; and 4)  have the background knowledge of the problem and computer software. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement,  it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Cancer Surveillance Research Program plans to enter into a sole source contract with Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, 527 SW Hall, Suite 300, Portland, OR 97201.  
The Northwest Tribal Registry Project was developed in January 1999 by the Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center, a tribally operated epidemiology program located at the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) in Portland, Oregon.  The Tribal Registry Project uses state of the art record linkage studies to increase the quality of health status surveillance data  for chronic diseases such as cancer for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.   Due to racial misclassification, cancer incidence rates among AI/ANs in the three Northwest states are substantially underestimated in the state cancer registries. Even after a more complete case ascertainment through record linkage, the rates for all cancer sites combined, and for most individual cancer sites, were lower among the Northwest AI/ANs than have been reported for US whites in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data. The findings on the occurrence of cancer among Northwest AI/AN will substantially increase the available knowledge of cancer among the population of interest. They will also inform ongoing efforts by the Northwest Tribal Cancer Control Project at NPAIHB to increase both the awareness and capacity of Northwest tribal communities to promote cancer prevention activities, and to improve the care and quality of life of their members who have cancer. This project will enable the Northwest Tribal Registry Project to continue its activities to ascertain more accurate estimates of the occurrence of cancer among Northwest American Indians and Alaskan Natives. The Northwest Tribal Registry Project  has been performing the required record linkage studies with state vital statistics data since 1999 and also serves the IHS region of the upper northwest.  It is the central point for data linkage for over 40 Indian tribes.  The Registry Project covers the states of Oregon, Idaho, and Washington and is located at the Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center, which is tribally operated through the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board. Liaison has already been established with tribal health program managers and the cancer registries covering the area. This is the only entity able to perform the requirements of this order.   This is not a request for competitive quotations, however, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement,  it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 p.m. EDT, on September 17,  2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Below are Questions and responses in regards to the solicitation. QUESTION 1:  Regarding payment and acceptance criteria:  Is our assumption correct that the second 50% of the payment that will be paid "on successful conclusion of the project" is predicated upon satisfying the acceptance criteria listed in the announcement?  If so, how does MMS intend to measure the following acceptance criteria:  Acceptance criterion 1:  How will MMS know that the organizational strategy is "successfully implemented"  A. Each firm should propose a strategy and schedule for performing the work. Your strategy and schedule will be the basis for evaluating acceptable implementation.  Firms that have a history of performing IT organizational work will know the best strategy and schedule for completing the work. Acceptance criterion 2:  How will MMS determine when employees are adequately trained?  A.  Each firm should propose training they believe will lead to the creation of a high performance IT organization.  Organizational development training should be designed to build a highly effective team environment that is supportive and focused on results.  Firms with a proven history of organizational development work will know the best strategy and schedule for completing the work.  Acceptance criterion 3:  What costs does MMS expect to be reported?  What mechanisms does MMS have to capture costs? A.  All costs associated with the task will be reported by the contractor, not MMS. Acceptance criterion 2:  Is the "IT corporate strategy" intended to serve as MMS' long range plan for guiding IT investments?  A.  The strategy should be comprehensive.  Firms with the past experience developing corporate IT strategy will know how to create the best strategy and schedule. QUESTION 2:  How long after implementation of the new organization does MMS expect to conduct a post-implementation survey and analyze results?  Must this be completed prior to collection of any of the 50% final payment? ANSWER 2:  A survey methodology and schedule should be proposed. QUESTION 3:  Is the contractor expected to develop personnel procedures as part of the realignment?  What is the approval process for new personnel procedures? ANSWER 3:  The successful firm will proposed a complete package to ensure all personnel actions are completed as part of reorganization.  The approval processes are contained in OPM, DOI and MMS regulations and policy manuals. QUESTION 4:  Are they planning to make this a small business set aside? What is the    NAICS code for this solicitation? ANSWER 4:  This is not a small business set aside. QUESTION 5:  MMS states that the synopsis posted on August 22, 2002 constitutes the only notice that will be issued.  Is it correct to assume that there will not be any documentation or further information distributed by MMS prior to the oral presentations and that the requirements as outlined in the synopsis will remain unchanged?         ANSWER 5:  This is the only notice being issued.  No additional information will be provided. QUESTION 6:  The government notes that a significant portion of the IT work for MSS is performed by contractors with regards to programming, operational support, enterprise support and help desk support?  Can you provide bidders a list of the names of these contractors? Answer:  Accenture, ACS, and NEI QUESTION 7:  We have submitted a request in writing for the report entitled An Overview of Information Technology, and have not heard back.  Could you please let us know the timing of receiving this report? Answer:  All reports have been sent out. QUESTION 8:  Deliverables, item 3 p Organizational development training needs assessment and recommendations.  Please confirm that this deliverable does not include conducting the actual training courses and is a report assessing how the MMS should provide training for near-term and long-term training. Answer:  This deliverable does not include training.  QUESTION 9:  Deliverables, item 5 - Post Implementation organizational survey and results.  Please provide details as it relates to this deliverable.  Will it be the contractors responsibility to design, distribute and calculate the post implementation survey or will MMS be responsible for distributing and tabulating the results?  What is the expected timeframe for this task?  How many surveys are expected by be distributed?  What is the means of distribution e.g. mail, email, fax, telephone?  Answer:  Contractors are responsible for all of this effort. QUESTION 10:  Deliverable, item 9 - Draft and final reports in print and electronic format.  Please specify the number of copies of the printed reports.  Does the electronic format include CD Roms?  If so, how many copies? Answer:  Electronic means e-mail.  In addition, offerors shall provide one CD-ROM. QUESTION 11:  Payment.  What will be the basis for the incremental implementation milestones?  Will these be deliverables or timeframes?  Is there flexibility for the contractor to propose an alternate payment schedule? Answer:  The contractor may propose milestone payments.  However 50% will still be based on successful completion. QUESTION 12:  Payment.  What determines "successful conclusion of the project"?  Is this the point in time that the contractor submits the final report to MMS or the end of a specific period in time? Answer:  See above answer to payment question. QUESTION 13:  General questions.             - What is the anticipated award date?            - How many resources will the MMS dedicate during this project and what is there availability relative to the 12 month period?   ANSWER:  The anticipated award date is 30 September 2002.  If the offeror is expecting MMS to dedicate resources to this effort, the offeror should detail that in their proposal. QUESTION 14:  Please clarify the use of the word "corporate" as it relates the proposed statement of work.  Is the word corporate referring to MMS or does it refer to the DOI as a whole?   ANSWER:  Corporate refers to MMS. QUESTION:  Does MMS have a preferred format or table of contents for the Capability Statement? Answer:  No, there is no preferred format.   QUESTION:  The RFP states the evaluation criteria for the cost and business proposals, but not for the Capability Statement.  What are these evaluation criteria?  Do they include any cost or rate components? Answer:  The evaluation criteria that are stated. QUESTION:  How far in advance of September 16th will vendors who are invited to give oral presentations be notified? Answer:  MMS will attempt to provide 5 days notice. QUESTION:  Please indicate whether or not you have a preference as to the volume of requested "Statement of Capabilities".  For example, do you have a preference for a volume of less than 10 pages or for more than 50 pages? ANSWER:  The response should be concise and meaningful. QUESTION:  Will inclusion of a section 8a or hubzone subcontractor in our proposed team influence the evaluation? ANSWER:  No, that will not affect the evaluation. QUESTION:  If the Capability Statement is sent via an email Do we still need to submit a hard copy of the same?    ANSWER:  In accordance with the announcement, hard copies are required. QUESTION:  What is expected from the contractor to include in an oral presentation package?  ANSWER:  The offerors response on how the work will be performed. QUESTION:  Is there a specific format that we must use for the written cost and business proposal?  ANSWER:  No, no specific format. QUESTION:  We would like to formally request a one week extension of the due date for the Capability Statement (to September 13, 2002).  ANSWER:  No extension is provided.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION DOES NOT SUPERSEDE SYNOPSIS SENT OUT ON 07/07/2000; RATHER IT IS A REQUEST FOR INPUT. ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS, INCLUDING THE DUE DATE, REMAINS THE SAME. REQUEST FOR INPUT FROM INTERESTED SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES - In August 1999, CDC created the Comprehensive Information Technology Contract Work Group, composed of representatives from the CDC's Centers, Institutes, and Offices (C/I/Os) to develop a recommendation as to the strategic direction CDC/ATSDR would follow for programming and microcomputer IT contractor support and services.  The goal was to produce a decision document to serve as a tool to:  establish a shared understanding of contracting considerations reviewed by CDC, provide management with available alternatives; and recommend alternatives for contracting mechanisms that can best achieve CDC's mission.  The Work Group conducted research and evaluation of available information in order to recommend a contracting approach that would be the most advantageous method for CDC to procure a large CDC wide information technology support services contract.  In addition, based on input from the work group members, 21 questions were drafted for industry response, and a  Request for Information was published in the Commerce Business Daily.  CDC received responses from 24 vendors that addressed the questions included in the RFI.  Based on the research and evaluation of different types of vehicles, following are the six contract alternatives, that the work group agreed would be evaluated: (1) Two Single Award Contracts, (2) Two contracts, each with separate scopes and multiple awards to several contractors, (3) Multiple award, Government Wide Acquisition Contracts, (4) Single Scope/Single Prime Vendor (with Subcontractors), (5)  Multiple Contractors/Single Scope, and (6) Multiple Scopes/Multiple Vendors.  The Work Group Decision Document Sub-Committee developed the preliminary document and submitted it to the work group with recommendations for the first and second choice alternatives.  The Work Group recommended to CDC's management one comprehensive contract with a single prime vendor and a single scope of work - combining programming services and microcomputer services - as the best approach for CDC to follow.  Two awards with a single prime vendor, one with a microcomputer scope of work and one with a programming services scope of work was recommended as the second best approach for CDC.  Further, it was recommended that the contract be flexible enough to allow task orders to be issued as fixed price, T&M, etc. Both alternatives should provide for a manageable environment in which protection of information and systems can be woven readily into CDC's collaborative efforts, from conceptual design to ultimate returement of a system.  To promote flexibility and continuous competition, both of these contracting alternatives are non-requirements, and allows CDC to choose other contracting vehicles, e.g., GWACs.  As a result of the approval of CDC management for a single award, non-requirements type environment using full and open procurement procedures, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a draft request for proposals for the acquisition of information systems development and microcomputer support services followed by a final RFP issued on or about 01/01. The contract, anticipated to be awarded in 10/01 will be a single award, ID/IQ Task Order type contract with the flexibility to award cost plus fixed fee, fixed price, time and materials and labor hour task orders dependent on the scope of the statements of work associated with the task order.  The contract will not be a requirements type contract.  The period of performance is 7 years with a basic period of performance and annual option periods not to exceed 84 months.  The estimated number of hours for the effort is 9,079,000.  CDC is pursuing a contract that will include programming services scopes of work which heretofore were small business set-asides in Cincinnati, Ohio and Morgantown, West Virginia, as well as the inclusion of the newly awarded, 2 1/2 year CDC-wide Microcomputer Support and Services contract also awarded as a total small business set-aside.  CDC will request approval of the bundling of these scopes of work from the Small Business Administration and pending their approval will issue the final RFP with these scopes included in the RFP.  Anticipated release time for the Draft RFP is late August, 2000.  The work under this contract is anticipated to consist of a variety of programming and microcomputer support services to CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) for various information systems technologies and computing platforms which includes mainframe, microprocessor workstation, and network server technologies and client-server applications.  Work involves information and data analysis systems in support of CDC's mission, for performing requirements analyses; design and development of new systems; ensuring information systems security; modification, maintenance and conversion of existing systems; data and database administration; training users in both CDC-developed and commercial applications; hot-line user support to application users such as CDC staff and state and local health professionals throughout the U.S. in the use of CDC-developed applications; programming support for the analysis of scientific, statistical, and public health data; systems integration, data conversion, and data communications via networking and telecommunications between disparate systems and geographic locations; data entry and keypunch support; graphics and desktop publishing; and computer center facilities operation. Work to be performed also includes hardware repair and maintenance of Government microcomputer equipment; maintaining a spare parts inventory; software support including installation, integration, operation and user orientation; local and wide area network administration and support; problem diagnosis and tracking including maintaining a CDC-wide Help Desk; and video teleconferencing support.  Existing technology is primarily Pentium-based microprocessors and installed microcomputers run Windows 95 and NT which are connected to IBM token ring and Ethernet Local Area Networks (LANs) running Novell NetWare version 4.11 operating system (soon to be upgraded to 5.x).   CDC plans to migrate to Novell NetWare 5.x in the near future, and to Sonet ring in the next 12 - 18 months.  CDC's network topology is a combination of token ring over type 1 cable, FDDI over category 5 cable, and Ethernet over type 1 or category 5 cable.  Supported protocols are TCP/IP, IPX, and SPX and CDC interconnects to the Internet.  The LANs are connected together into a Wide Area Network (WAN) using multi protocol and high speed routers over fiber optic cable or leased data lines.  A broadband Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) interconnects all large Atlanta campuses.  Currently FDDI is the method used for the WAN.  Within a 12 -18 month period, the WAN will use ATM over T-1 and the MAN will migrate to an OC-48 network.  Offerors must be capable of repairing and maintaining equipment from a variety of manufacturers, i.e., Dell, Compaq, AST, SUN microcomputers, with a few MacIntosh.  Contract performance will be at CDC's primary offices in Atlanta, GA as well as in Washington, DC; Cincinnati, OH; Morgantown, WV; Hyatttsville, MD; and Research Triangle Park, NC, as well as in the contractor's facilities. Travel may also be necessary to other CDC sites such as Anchorage, AK; San Juan, PR; and occasional travel outside the United States. The draft solicitation will be available on or about August 31, 2000.  Written or electronic comments only.  Provide comments not later than 09/18/00.  Comments will be included in our SBA request for bundling document.  Comments should specify RFP 2000-N-00120.  Telephone comments will not be considered.  Point of Contacts: CDC:  Deborah S.

<DESC>BAA 01-42, ADDENDUM NO. 12, SPECIAL FOCUS AREA: ENGINEERED BIO-MOLECULAR NANO-DEVICES/SYSTEMS (MOLDICE).  The Defense Sciences Office is interested in receiving proposals for innovative research on the development and demonstration of novel hybrid (biotic-abiotic) nanoscale interface technologies that enable direct, real-time conversion of bio-molecular signals into electrical signals.  Biological systems exhibit remarkable sensitivity, selectivity and efficiency that could be exploited in engineering systems should appropriate interfaces become available.  Biological systems have well defined sensing units, signal processing units and actuation sub-systems that determine responses to specific stimuli.  While significant effort has gone into understanding the sensing systems of biology (e.g., receptor and transmembrane proteins), the intra-cellular signal processing system is still the subject of many ongoing research efforts.  The objective of this research is to develop hybrid bio-molecular devices/systems that use biological units (e.g., Protein Ion Channels/Nanopores, G-Protein Coupled Receptors, etc.) for performing the sensing function but use silicon circuitry to accomplish the signal processing.  Innovative ideas are needed for the development of interfaces (to ion channels and receptors) that enable the real-time (temporal) transduction of molecular (stochastic) events into electrical signals.  A critical focus of this program is the exploitation of temporal (kinetic) information for the real-time analysis and detection of molecular targets.  This research will lay the foundation for advanced ?biology-to-digital? converter systems that enable direct, real-time conversion of biological signals into digital information.  Ongoing research in nanotechnology is starting to demonstrate controlled fabrication of high quality nanostructures (nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanopores, etc.) that are capable of interacting with biology at the molecular scale.  Significant recent accomplishments in biology and surface chemistry have also demonstrated programmed assembly of engineered molecular structures with excellent control on spatial distribution and orientation.  It is anticipated that these developments will lead to new kinds of nanoscale bio-electronic interface technologies extendible to array platforms that enable combinatorial, dynamic (real-time) sampling of stochastic signals from individual bio-molecular receptors in order to develop unique bio-signatures for various target molecules of interest.  Examples of potential bio-molecular devices (that perform bio-electronic transduction at the nanoscale) include protein ion channels that have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive detectors of molecular events.  MOLDICE is a two-phase program addressing the above ideas and concepts.  The main goal of the Phase I effort is to demonstrate novel and innovative hybrid bio-molecular device architectures that are scalable to 2D array platforms.  Phase 1 will explore techniques to assemble bio-molecular sensing devices (e.g., engineered protein ion channels/receptors) on a substrate with appropriate interface technologies to couple to silicon circuitry.  The Phase I effort will also investigate and demonstrate novel methods to electrically address these bio-molecules at the nanoscale.  Issues such as device orientation, spatial distribution, materials compatibility/robustness, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ability to scale-up (to arrays), signal bandwidth and temporal resolution, etc. will be addressed during this phase.  A key Phase I milestone will be the measurement and validation of electrical signals (bio-signatures) for various target molecules of interest.  Phase 2 will focus on scale-up of the Phase I device architectures into array platforms with large-scale integration and parallelization.  An important component of the Phase II effort will be the signal processing task associated with array processing of stochastic signals from individual bio-molecular sensing devices.  Additionally, Phase II will demonstrate operation and controllability of devices and systems and quantify performance metrics for the array platform (sensitivity, selectivity, speed, efficiency and power consumption) in the context of various sensing schemes.  Proposals should be phased.  Phase I should not exceed eighteen (18) months, with Phase II not exceeding thirty (30) months.  All milestones are considered as "go/no-go" decision points.  If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur at the end of each Phase.  Proposals in response to this addendum should describe an 18-month Phase 1 program.  Proposers may submit an optional Phase II proposal for a 24-30 month effort, however, selections will be made on the basis of the Phase I effort only.  Proposers for Phase 1 should consider research efforts that address one or more of the following technical areas:  (1) Signal Acquisition and Transduction : Investigate the exploitation of the temporal domain (i.e., kinetics) to develop unique bio-signatures for various molecules of interest to the biological/chemical sensing community.  Determine the nature of signals that need to be extracted from hybrid bio-molecular devices and the information content in these signals.  Explore engineering of bio-molecular devices to provide specific signals of interest.  Study and quantify acquisition, filtering, amplification and temporal resolution of the signal from the hybrid bio-molecular device.  (2) Electronic Addressability at the Molecular Scale: Investigate novel and innovative technologies to enable single molecule addressability at the nanoscale for high SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) transduction of the signals for further processing in silicon.  Develop novel interface technologies to ultimately convert these signals into real-time electrical signals.  Investigate novel materials and assembly/integration technologies to ensure robust and reliable device operation.  Progress in this program will depend on the formation of well-managed interdisciplinary efforts drawing on expertise from such areas as molecular biology, bio-chemistry, electrical engineering, materials science, applied mathematics, computer science and micro/nano-fabrication.  In addition, it is expected that a strong modeling component will be included wherever necessary.  Regardless of the interdisciplinary composition of the team, its members will need to be sharply and collectively focused on achieving the Phase 1 objectives.  A limited number of smaller efforts focused on developing unique approaches to overcoming specific technology challenges may be supported with an eye towards incorporating them into the integrated team efforts by the end of the program. 
DARPA invites white papers (10 pages or less) in response to this announcement.  The white paper should be organized as follows: 1) Description of the Idea: What specific capabilities are being proposed?  What is novel about this idea and why is it better (and by how much?) as compared to current state-of-the-art?  2) The Planned Approach: How will the proposed capabilities be demonstrated within the 18 month period of funding?  What are the research challenges and milestones, and how will these be addressed? Every white paper must describe the 18-month quantitative milestone(s) that will be achieved in order to meet the Phase I objectives; 3) The Cost: What is the cost estimate for resources required for the proposed time line? This section should include a clear description of the human resources and equipment (if any), and appropriate justification for these resources/costs; and 4) The Team: A brief description of the technical expertise of the principal investigator and the key team members should be provided. The management plan should describe how the different disciplines represented on the team would be integrated to generate a capability demonstration within 18 months.

<DESC>This is notice that WR-ALC anticipates issuing a contract to Northrop Grumman, Baltimore, MD for the acquisition of spare parts and repairs for items that are determined to be sole source to Northrop Grumman.  The initial award will focus on items within FSC 5895.  Other sole source items outside of FSC 5895 will be included throughout the life of the contract.  A fixed price type contract is contemplated for a total of ten years.  An award fee clause based on delivery performance may be included.   

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a notice to all potential offerors that, on or about 17 September 2002, the Joint Stars/Multi-Platform Command and Control Aircraft Program Office (JS/MA) anticipates the release on the HERBB website (www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil) of a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP), (F19628-02-R-0056), for the MC2A BMC4I subsystem selection.  The FINAL RFP, F19628-02-R-0056, is anticipated for release on 30 October 2002. The MC2A is the key piece of the MC2 Constellation that will extend the commander's eyes and ears while serving as the primary element of the C2 architecture.  The first increment of MC2A will utilize an MP-RTIP radar on a 767-400ER aircraft to achieve ground moving target indicator capability.  The second increment is planned to add air moving target indicator capability.  The MC2A will be fully integrated within architecture of joint combat and ISR systems, space-based systems, and all-source intelligence exploitation systems to achieve the highest predictive battlespace awareness.  The BMC4I subsystem includes all of the non-radar and non-aircraft subsystems including the central computing architecture, networks, data storage, data manipulation, data fusion, data exploitation, communications and data link capability. The objective of the BMC4I program is to design, develop, integrate, and test a BMC4I subsystem for the MC2A weapon system.  The MC2A BMC4I contractor will provide improvements in the quality and timeliness of information to support more rapid decision analysis, increased battlespace awareness, and shorter decision cycle to advance information superiority and precision engagement.  The MC2A BMC4I subsystem will allow for future capability growth, utilize Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) to the maximum extent possible, be Common Operating Environment (COE) compliant and utilize open systems architecture to achieve the highest levels of systems interoperability.  It will handle data at multiple security levels and will fuse on and off board data to create a common operating picture. To speed delivery and allow insertion of new technologies / capabilities, an evolutionary acquisition approach is planned for the MC2A weapon system.  The first increment will provide ground moving target indicator capability with BMC4I while the second increment adds air moving target indicator capability with BMC4I.  Spiral development within the increments is also planned.  The Government intends to award a sole source cost plus award fee MC2A Weapon System Integration (WSI) contract to which the BMC4I subsystem will be a directed subcontractor.  The BMC4I subcontractor will be selected by the Government through proposal evaluation and contractor demonstrations.  Following selection the MC2A WSI contractor will award a subcontract to the company selected by the Government.  The BMC4I subsystem rough order of magnitude estimate is approximately $500 Million for the Pre-System Design Development (Pre-SSD) and SDD effort. We will be using the ESC split proposal process for this solicitation. Past performance information will be due approximately 15 days after RFP release.  Offerors will be given approximately 45 days after RFP release to provide the technical proposal, a design plan for contractor demonstrations, and a macro-level cost proposal.  Approximately 60 days after RFP release, face-to-face reviews and contractor demonstrations will be conducted.  Afterwards, complete proposals will be due to include detailed cost proposals. REQUESTS FOR THE RFP: Teams or Prime Contractors interested in competing in this acquisition must submit a request for the RFP.  These interested parties must follow the instructions below: 1.  Submit a request to ericka.dailey@hanscom.af.mil by 16 September 2002; telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted. 2.  Firms responding to this request shall indicate whether they are a large business, small business, very small business, small-disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business. 3.  Foreign-owned firms, including Canadian sources, are not eligible to compete. 4.  Interested Contractors desiring business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System. This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  It does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or the Contracting Officer, but communicates concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Electronic Systems Center's Ombudsman is Colonel Jerry T. Corley, Director, Commander's Staff, at (781) 377-5106.  The Ombudsman should be contacted only with issues or problems that have been brought previously to the attention of the Program Manager and/or Contracting Officer and could not be resolved satisfactorily at that level. Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  Please direct any questions on this NOCA to ESC/JS/MA, Bldg 1630, 75 Vandenberg Drive, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731, Attn: Joe Zimmerman, Contracting Officer, 781-377-3570, joe.zimmerman@hanscom.af.mil or Capt. Ericka Dailey, Contracts Manager, 781-377-5379, ericka.dailey@hanscom.af.mil. The Government anticipates a subcontractor selection on or about 26 March 2003.

<DESC>Solicitation Notice:  This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for alterations of the Thomas J. McIntyre Federal Building.  The facility is approximately 10,841 gross square meters (116,692 SF).  The building consists of a four-story tower with one story postal facility adjacent to the tower and a two story-parking garage attached to the rear of the structure.  The alteration work will include, but not be limited to: modernization of office space, renovate main lobby, replacement of roof and windows, extension of sprinkler system, seismic reinforcement, miscellaneous upgrades to mechanical and electrical systems, and asbestos abatement throughout the building.  (All abatement work will be done during other than normal working hours in unoccupied areas.)  (The building will be mostly occupied throughout the project).  Work will be conducted in phases to accommodate continued occupancy of the building. The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on complex multi-phased renovations & alterations. GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: renovation of an occupied office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of approximately $5 million dollars or more and / or phased construction renovation projects in occupied buildings of approximately $5 million dollars or more that involve the removal of hazardous materials. The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project. The approximate duration of the contract is 2 years. This project is designed using metric units and the estimated cost of this project is more than ten million dollars ($10,000,000).  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, qualified/experienced personnel, subcontracting opportunities, and on their price proposals. The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- Receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors. Phase 2 - Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms. In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors and the basis of GSA's opinion. GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3. Phase 3- Receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer). Phase 4 - oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range. Phase 5- negotiations and receipt and evaluation of final offers. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price. The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4. The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 1. Past Performance, 2. Key Personnel & Experience, and 3. Subcontracting. The NAICS code applicable to this project is 233320.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice. Copies of this Solicitation (RFP) minus technical specifications and drawings will be available through the World Wide Web only,  on approximately 09/03/2002 (www.fedbizopps.gov ). To be included on our GSA source list, please mail, fax or email your request to Joyce Paul, at GSA, Property Development Division (1PC), 10 Causeway Street, Room 975, Boston, MA 02222-1077; fax 617-565-5967 or email joyce.paul@gsa.gov , reference Solicitation Number GS-01P-02-BZC-0040 for identification purposes, TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED.

<SOLNBR>BEP-A76Accounting
<RESPDATE>091602

<CONTACT>Robert Knauer, Procurement Analyst, Phone (202)874-5827, Fax (202)874-3135, Email Robert.Knauer@bep.treas.gov
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT.  The Bureau of Engraving & Printing is seeking all commercial businesses as well as those in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area in order to prepare for an OMB Circular 
A-76 Streamlined process to occur over the period November 2002 to February 2003 timeframe.  This A-76 Streamlined Process is based on the assumption that the commercial activity (CA) under study is regularly performed by contract either in the commercial or government operating environments at (Firm Fixed Price), and that existing contracts can be used, with only minor modifications, to define the scope of the competition and avoid the need to develop a new or original PWS or a formal solicitation.

Therefore, firms and ISSA activity?s which have experience and also have current government contracts for ?accounting services, specifically the accounts payable sub-function and are of a functional size of 10 or less FTE accounting technicians should respond to this notice.   The accounts payable sub-function involves invoice receipt, matching with purchase, travel and other types of orders which must be validated, reconciled, processed, and properly submitted for payment in accordance with Bureau processing procedures.  All interested and capable parties which have expertise in the accounts payable/invoice processing may respond or submit statements of their qualifications.  Responses must include specific information as to the 1) contract number, if any 2) point of contact 3) number of direct labor FTE?s working on the current contract 4) the firm fixed price, and or total labor hour and material cost total dollars involved for the period of performance covered.  Also firms must respond as to the 5) firm?s capabilities 6) size and business status, i.e., 8A, SB, Veteran Owned, etc? and 7) if there are any similar commercial contracts in the same functional areas currently, or previously performed of 12 months or less for similar functional with which to make an overall assessment of the firms actual contract costs for the 1) Labor  2) Materials and 3) overhead involved in this function.  

THIS IS NOT AN RFP OR RFQ AT THIS TIME, however, under the Streamlined process it may become one.  If 4 (four) current contracts (within 12 months or less) that are Federal, State, or local are not available with which to make a ?full cost? range determination against the Government?s current MEO costs, then a more formal IFB process will be used.

<CONTACT>Constance Fortune, Contract Specialist, Phone (703)681-0242, Fax (703)681-1211, Email fortunec@ncr.disa.mil
<DESC>1.  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to industry seeking vendors interested in participating in the Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (JWID) 2003.  The Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2003 (JWID 03) scheduled for 2-27 June 2003.  The new focus for JWID is solely on coalition interoperability.  Combatant Commands, Services and Agencies (C/S/As) are invited to submit coalition interoperability trial (CIT) proposals for JWID 03 by 30 September 2002. CIT proposals from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and national participants outside the United States must be received by 14 October 2002.  Department of Defense (DOD) industry partners must work through a C/S/A sponsor to submit CITs.  Complete details On JWID 03, to include the format and submission instructions For CITs, can be found at http://www.jwid.js.mil.

2. JWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event that enables the US combatant commands and international community to investigate command, control, communications, and computers (C4) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability.  The intent is to demonstrate C4 Capabilities in CITs during JWID that can then be moved into operational use in the near term.

3. United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) is the host combatant command for JWID 03.  Coalition participation includes Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO to include several constituent nations. In addition, USPACOM will invite Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand to participate as Coalition Task Force (CTF) members. 

4. JWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for warfighter validation Of C4 solutions.  Each CIT will receive a comprehensive assessment. Depending on the CIT, the assessment may include a warfighter, technical, and/or a security assessment.  JWID is conducted over a worldwide secure network enabling trials classified secret releasable to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and NATO.  A key objective of JWID 03 is to investigate how to provide multiple levels of security on the network given that Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand will participate in JWID as members of the CTF.  Industry partners provide funding for and run the CITs in coordination with their DOD sponsor.

5. C/S/As and multinational partners will propose CITs to address one or more of the JWID 03 objectives listed in paragraph 6.  By submitting a trial proposal, the submitter commits to fully resource the CIT (funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, etc.) for JWID 03.  Given the new focus of JWID, DOD industry partners must submit trials in concert with a DOD sponsor.  CIT proposals must be provided in a specific format as detailed on the JWID web site.  The JWID Senior Management Group (SMG), in concert with the coalition partners, will select specific CIT proposals for execution by 22 November 2002 given projected availability of resources, how well the CIT dovetails with the objectives, and additional considerations as specified on the JWID web site.

6. The Joint Staff J-6, in coordination with USPACOM, gathered and prioritized coalition interoperability objectives for JWID 03 from the Unified Commands (via United States Joint Forces Command), NATO, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The overall goal is to use JWID to help define standard material and non-material solutions for coalition information sharing problems and issues.  A short summary of the six specific JWID 03 objectives follows.  The JWID web site contains more information about the objectives.

a.  Objective 1: Provide solutions to improve information sharing between nations given requirements for multiple levels of security and different combinations of access specifications among nations.  Explanation: Operating a single coalition network used by many nations presents a unique set of information protection and dissemination problems.   There must be an automated, straightforward mechanism to associate the specifications for access or release with the information itself.  The mechanism must provide for multiple domains of information sharing.  The mechanism must also enable nations to easily change the information sharing specification at any time up to and including adding and deleting all access to another nations.  The specification of access must also allow the owner to specify access given based on the classification of the data.  The information must also be protected while it is in transit from origin to destination given the specification for access.  This general requirement for information protection can/should be applied to any method of information sharing to include (but is not limited to) e-mail (with attachments), collaborative tools, file transfer, and web site access.  Any proposed trial that satisfies all or a part of the requirements in this objective will be considered for inclusion.

b.  Objective 2: Provide solutions for sharing information between logistics systems of different nations in support of planning and execution of operations.  Explanation: As coalition operations become more intertwined, it will become more important to synchronize logistics operations.  Information on logistics can also part of situational awareness feeds to other nations (related to objective 4).  

c.  Objective 3: Provide real time/near real time language translations tools to enable more effective coalition operations.  Explanation: Provide a real time/near real time multi-language text translation for chat, e-mail, and documents (including e-mail attachments).  Investigate opportunities for real time translation of voice communications over the computer network (voice over IP) and the audio portion of desktop video teleconferencing via collaborative planning tools.  Translate as many languages as possible with one tool as opposed to using different tools to translate different languages for the same general application.  Specifically interested in those languages used by the JWID '03 participants.  Translation tools should also have military and technical terms in their dictionary/database.

d.  Objective 4: Provide methods to share situational awareness information with nations using coalition networks.  Explanation: This objective centers on defining what situational awareness data needs to be shared with other nations and how that exchange will take place.  The question of what to exchange (content) is determined by the needs of the warfighter.  Must use existing interface standards that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data to the greatest extent possible.  Solutions must support each nation's disclosure and release policy. Possible information to exchange would include friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, map data, other intelligence information, etc.  Information exchange should support planning and execution of operations.  At a higher level, this issue concerns effective information dissemination and knowledge management.  This includes problems of integration, translation, or conversion of data in one format to another; identification of producers and consumers of information; and how to transmit the information securely from end to end while supporting national disclosure/release policy.

e.  Objective 5: Define a minimum set of capabilities and procedures required to establish a coalition network vulnerability assessment capability.  Explanation: Security must be incorporated into the network as it is being built.  A network must also constantly be updated to remain protected from emerging threats.  There is a need to identify a standard set of capabilities that a given tool suite must support with respect to vulnerability assessment.  Trials in JWID '03 should investigate use of information assurance network situational awareness tools to detect and defend against computer network attacks in real time (e.g. hacking attempts, unauthorized access attempts, etc.).   There is also a need to define related processes for identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in the network and to develop related procedures to disseminate vulnerability warnings with related fix actions to member nations.  There should also be tools and/or methods to use in validating that fix actions were actually accomplished.  This objective is concerned with defining the minimum set of capabilities that a tool (or tool suite) should provide, not with picking a specific tool suite to use.  

f.  Objective 6: Determine and validate core network services solutions for implementation on the operational coalition networks.  Explanation: The intent of this objective is to define required capabilities that each nation must provide with respect to the provision and operation of network services between all nations.  This objective also includes defining standards for network services between nations.  A basic set of core services has been defined for the CWAN for JWID based on previous work.  The purpose of this objective is to identify possible additional core services and investigate standards for existing services in more detail.  Possible areas to examine include (but are not limited to): a network situational awareness tool/suite; distributed collaborative planning tools; messaging protocols (e.g. X.400 or X.500); integrating Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) into the network; and bandwidth management tools.  Issues related to bandwidth management will become more important as bandwidth-intensive tools are used more often (e.g. imagery dissemination, voice over IP and collaborative planning to include desktop video functions).  This work will help to bring together existing solutions for operational coalition networks to support work in converging on a single standard.

7.  Subject to changes, the following milestones are to be used for planning purposes:
	a.  Coalition Interoperability Trial proposals due 30 Sep.
	b.  Initial planning conference 18-22 Nov 02 @ Virginia Beach, VA.
	c.  Mid-term planning conference 3-7 Feb 03 @ Virginia Beach, VA.
	d.  Final planning conference 24-28 Mar 03 @ Virginia Beach, VA.
	e.  JWID 03 execution period 2-27 Jun 03.
		(1). CIT set up 2-6 Jun 03.
		(2). Rehearsal 9-13 Jun 03.
		(3). CIT assessment 16-27 Jun 03.




8.  Administrative requirements:  
		a.  All information submitted for CIT proposals will be considered and handled as non-proprietary.
		b.  Unclassified and classified networks will be used.  US CIT participants will require a minimum of DOD SECRET clearance to participate in JWID 03. The principal network that CITs will use will be at a combined SECRET-releasable security level.
		c.  Military personnel, as opposed to industry or civilian personnel, will operate the CIT during assessments.  CITs must provide required training at each JWID 03 site where their CIT is located.  JWID funds will not be provided for training.
		d.  CITs will be required to provide on-site technical and operational representation throughout all JWID 03 planning conferences and execution phases.  JWID funds will not be used.

9.  Please direct questions concerning JWID 2003 to the JWID JMO Point of Contact,  LCDR Mike Ward, (757)-225-2153 (DSN 575) or e-mail: mike.ward@langley.af.mil.  Vendors may submit CIT proposals immediately for this effort.  Please refer to the JWID website www.jwid.js.mil for specific information about CIT proposal submissions.

10. Events of the past year have highlighted the need for coalition nations to exchange information.  With its new single focus on coalition interoperability, JWID will play a large part in improving coalition information sharing.

11.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government will not offer any compensation, monetary or otherwise, for the written submission of information.  The Contractor assumes all liability of costs, to include, but not be limited to, preparation of the CIT proposal.  No contract award shall be made as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.  Industry participation in JWID 03 is at no cost to the Government.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans to develop an electronic interface that transmits data between itself and its partners in the Disability processing program.  Under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act (42 USC 402 and 416), SSA mandates the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) in each state to perform determinations of disability for the residents of that state who file for Social Security disability benefits.  In addition to each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territorial governments of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have established DDS entities.  SSA has also established a Federal DDS, which, among other functions, serves as a test bed of policy and procedure for the disability program. There are approximately 117 DDS sites nationally.  DDS sites are diverse in size, ranging from staff of 2 to 875, although most fall in the 35 to 350 range. Many of the states use licensed proprietary software developed by Versa Management Systems Inc (Versa).  Versa is only known source that can provide, modify and maintain its own software and source code.  They have contracts specific to each state and they have state maintenance agreements with Versa to support the code.  In addition, each state has, by necessity and choice, customized the code to meet their specific requirements.  The current lines of code vary from state to state, depending on the degree of customization and the interface to the state systems, but a representative estimate is approximately 1,000,000 lines of code per state.  Over the last few years, SSA and the DDSs have been engaged in major initiatives to improve the administration of the disability programs.  These initiatives included enhancements to the disability information systems used within SSA and the DDSs.  SSA has updated its strategy for automating enhancements to the Disability program.  The revised strategy, the Electronic Disability system (eDib), is a comprehensive project for all components in the disability processing enterprise.  One of the major objectives of eDib is to provide access to and sharing of disability information to all disability processing components through an Electronic Folder.   The Electronic Folder is pictured as a data store that contains information that is directly or indirectly important to processing disability cases.  The first step towards implementing the Electronic Folder involved the creation by Versa of a generic interface between SSA and the DDSs.  This step was successfully implemented between SSA and the Texas DDS in August 2001.  SSA is seeking a contractor who can develop, test, and implement modifications to the existing interface and its supporting processes.  The modifications will allow the DDS software systems to receive additional data elements from SSA?s Electronic Folder.  The contractor will be required to work with the Versa Users Group to identify the data elements that should be propagated into their legacy systems.  The legacy system software will then be modified to utilize these agreed upon elements.  These modifications should be designed so that, in the future, the interface and its supporting processes can be implemented in additional Versa states.  The modifications must preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the specific user interfaces and user screen presentations which exist in the current DDS systems, so as to minimize potential work flow impact and the need for user retraining.  SSA will identify and describe the new set of data elements.  SSA will not provide the Versa proprietary source code.  Vendors having the capability and experience to provide such a service are invited to submit complete details.  The details must include the following:
- Demonstrated success in writing and supporting COBOL applications on the IBM AS/400 platform;  
- A detailed explanation of the strategy that will be used in dealing with the Versa proprietary source code and data structures. 
Responses must clearly state the ability to provide the service required.  Interested parties must respond to this notice in writing within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication. Please refer to LJH-02-001.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY!  This is not a request for proposal (RFP).  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received.   REQUESTS FOR COPIES OF A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE HONORED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

CIT proposals from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and national participants outside the United States must be received by 14 October 2002.  Department of Defense (DOD) industry partners must work through a C/S/A sponsor to submit CITs.  Complete details On JWID 03, to include the format and submission instructions For CITs, can be found at http://www.jwid.js.mil.

2. JWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event that enables the US combatant commands and international community to investigate command, control, communications, and computers (C4) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability.  The intent is to demonstrate C4 Capabilities in CITs during JWID that can then be moved into operational use in the near term.

3. United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) is the host combatant command for JWID 03.  Coalition participation includes Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO to include several constituent nations. In addition, USPACOM will invite Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand to participate as Coalition Task Force (CTF) members. 

4. JWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for warfighter validation Of C4 solutions.  Each CIT will receive a comprehensive assessment. Depending on the CIT, the assessment may include a warfighter, technical, and/or a security assessment.  JWID is conducted over a worldwide secure network enabling trials classified secret releasable to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and NATO.  A key objective of JWID 03 is to investigate how to provide multiple levels of security on the network given that Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand will participate in JWID as members of the CTF.  Industry partners provide funding for and run the CITs in coordination with their DOD sponsor.

5. C/S/As and multinational partners will propose CITs to address one or more of the JWID 03 objectives listed in paragraph 6.  By submitting a trial proposal, the submitter commits to fully resource the CIT (funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, etc.) for JWID 03.  Given the new focus of JWID, DOD industry partners must submit trials in concert with a DOD sponsor.  CIT proposals must be provided in a specific format as detailed on the JWID web site.  The JWID Senior Management Group (SMG), in concert with the coalition partners, will select specific CIT proposals for execution by 22 November 2002 given projected availability of resources, how well the CIT dovetails with the objectives, and additional considerations as specified on the JWID web site.

6. The Joint Staff J-6, in coordination with USPACOM, gathered and prioritized coalition interoperability objectives for JWID 03 from the Unified Commands (via United States Joint Forces Command), NATO, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The overall goal is to use JWID to help define standard material and non-material solutions for coalition information sharing problems and issues.  A short summary of the six specific JWID 03 objectives follows.  The JWID web site contains more information about the objectives.

a.  Objective 1: Provide solutions to improve information sharing between nations given requirements for multiple levels of security and different combinations of access specifications among nations.  Explanation: Operating a single coalition network used by many nations presents a unique set of information protection and dissemination problems.   There must be an automated, straightforward mechanism to associate the specifications for access or release with the information itself.  The mechanism must provide for multiple domains of information sharing.  The mechanism must also enable nations to easily change the information sharing specification at any time up to and including adding and deleting all access to another nations.  The specification of access must also allow the owner to specify access given based on the classification of the data.  The information must also be protected while it is in transit from origin to destination given the specification for access.  This general requirement for information protection can/should be applied to any method of information sharing to include (but is not limited to) e-mail (with attachments), collaborative tools, file transfer, and web site access.  Any proposed trial that satisfies all or a part of the requirements in this objective will be considered for inclusion.

b.  Objective 2: Provide solutions for sharing information between logistics systems of different nations in support of planning and execution of operations.  Explanation: As coalition operations become more intertwined, it will become more important to synchronize logistics operations.  Information on logistics can also part of situational awareness feeds to other nations (related to objective 4).  

c.  Objective 3: Provide real time/near real time language translations tools to enable more effective coalition operations.  Explanation: Provide a real time/near real time multi-language text translation for chat, e-mail, and documents (including e-mail attachments).  Investigate opportunities for real time translation of voice communications over the computer network (voice over IP) and the audio portion of desktop video teleconferencing via collaborative planning tools.  Translate as many languages as possible with one tool as opposed to using different tools to translate different languages for the same general application.  Specifically interested in those languages used by the JWID '03 participants.  Translation tools should also have military and technical terms in their dictionary/database.

d.  Objective 4: Provide methods to share situational awareness information with nations using coalition networks.  Explanation: This objective centers on defining what situational awareness data needs to be shared with other nations and how that exchange will take place.  The question of what to exchange (content) is determined by the needs of the warfighter.  Must use existing interface standards that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data to the greatest extent possible.  Solutions must support each nation's disclosure and release policy. Possible information to exchange would include friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, map data, other intelligence information, etc.  Information exchange should support planning and execution of operations.  At a higher level, this issue concerns effective information dissemination and knowledge management.  This includes problems of integration, translation, or conversion of data in one format to another; identification of producers and consumers of information; and how to transmit the information securely from end to end while supporting national disclosure/release policy.

e.  Objective 5: Define a minimum set of capabilities and procedures required to establish a coalition network vulnerability assessment capability.  Explanation: Security must be incorporated into the network as it is being built.  A network must also constantly be updated to remain protected from emerging threats.  There is a need to identify a standard set of capabilities that a given tool suite must support with respect to vulnerability assessment.  Trials in JWID '03 should investigate use of information assurance network situational awareness tools to detect and defend against computer network attacks in real time (e.g. hacking attempts, unauthorized access attempts, etc.).   There is also a need to define related processes for identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in the network and to develop related procedures to disseminate vulnerability warnings with related fix actions to member nations.  There should also be tools and/or methods to use in validating that fix actions were actually accomplished.  This objective is concerned with defining the minimum set of capabilities that a tool (or tool suite) should provide, not with picking a specific tool suite to use.  

f.  Objective 6: Determine and validate core network services solutions for implementation on the operational coalition networks.  Explanation: The intent of this objective is to define required capabilities that each nation must provide with respect to the provision and operation of network services between all nations.  This objective also includes defining standards for network services between nations.  A basic set of core services has been defined for the CWAN for JWID based on previous work.  The purpose of this objective is to identify possible additional core services and investigate standards for existing services in more detail.  Possible areas to examine include (but are not limited to): a network situational awareness tool/suite; distributed collaborative planning tools; messaging protocols (e.g. X.400 or X.500); integrating Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) into the network; and bandwidth management tools.  Issues related to bandwidth management will become more important as bandwidth-intensive tools are used more often (e.g. imagery dissemination, voice over IP and collaborative planning to include desktop video functions).  This work will help to bring together existing solutions for operational coalition networks to support work in converging on a single standard.

7.  Subject to changes, the following milestones are to be used for planning purposes:
	a.  Coalition Interoperability Trial proposals due 30 Sep.
	b.  Initial planning conference 18-22 Nov 02 @ Virginia Beach, VA.
	c.  Mid-term planning conference 3-7 Feb 03 @ Virginia Beach, VA.

Vendors may submit CIT proposals immediately for this effort.  Please refer to the JWID website www.jwid.js.mil for specific information about CIT proposal submissions.

10. Events of the past year have highlighted the need for coalition nations to exchange information.  With its new single focus on coalition interoperability, JWID will play a large part in improving coalition information sharing.

11.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government will not offer any compensation, monetary or otherwise, for the written submission of information.  The Contractor assumes all liability of costs, to include, but not be limited to, preparation of the CIT proposal.  No contract award shall be made as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.  Industry participation in JWID 03 is at no cost to the Government.

The following FAR clauses/provisions are also incorporated by reference into this solicitation: FAR provision 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal (AUG 1999); FAR clause 52-216-18, Ordering (OCT 1995).  This clause will be completed upon award.  FAR clause 52.216-19, Order Limitations (OCT 1995) - (a) "Minimum Order - When the Government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than $100.00, the Government is not obligated to purchase, nor is the Contractor obligated to furnish those supplies under the contract.  (b) Maximum order - The Contractor is not obligated to honor - - (1) any order for a single item in excess of $725,000; (2) Any order for a combination of items in excess of $725,000; or (3) A series of orders from the same ordering office within 60 days that together call for quantities exceeding the limitation in subparagraph (b)(a) or (2) of this section. . .  The offeror shall furnish the guaranteed minimum of $145,000, and as ordered, any additional quantities of equipment which may not exceed an estimated maximum of $725,000 over the five year life of the contract.  The Government shall not be required to purchase from the successful offeror(s) any additional quantities after the initial guaranteed dollar minimum.   The clause at 52.216-22, Indefinite Quantity (OCT 1995), applies to this acquisition.  The clause at 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (MAR 2000), "The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. . ."  The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any option under this clause, shall not exceed five years.  TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENT -  It is anticipated that the Government's requirement for the equipment described in this contract will extend over several years, perhaps exceeding the technological life of the proposed equipment.  It may be in the best interest of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as well as the contractor, to substitute equipment of a newer technology for the equipment proposed, or some portion thereof, provided that the conditions below are satisfied.  During the life of the contract, and under its terms and conditions, the Government may request, or the Contractor may propose to provide, technologically advanced equipment, software or any other item(s) contracted hereunder.   Types of Upgrades -  The upgrades covered by this clause will generally be substituted for functional items/systems already in the contract.  The substitution may be in total or in part.  The upgrades discussed in this clause are not replacements for items or systems already ordered and installed, and nothing in this clause shall be construed as authority for such replacement of installed equipment.  The one exception to this exclusion is software.  Installed software will always be eligible for an "upgrade", to allow the Government to maintain currency, consistency, and compatibility in its software.  It is further understood by the parties to this contract that this clause envisages technological refreshment related to the general type of hardware and software covered by the scope of this contract.  Minimum Qualifications for Acceptance of Upgrades -  The Government is under no obligation to substitute any item for an item already listed in the contract.  However, subject to mutual agreement when required above, when items are added to this contract under this clause, the item(s) shall meet the following criteria: (1)  have been sold to the general public in substantial quantities before substitution under this clause;  (2)  meet or exceed all mandatory requirements of the contract; (3)  be fully compatible with the originally proposed equipment; (4)  the price should be equal to or less than the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the item.  The Contractor shall agree to all terms and conditions, including delivery and installation, being equal to or more favorable to the Government than the substituted equipment; (5)  be judged technically acceptable by the COTR; (6)  be approved in writing, by execution of a contract modification, signed by both the FBI Contracting Officer and the Contractor's representative; and (7)  shall undergo acceptance testing in accordance with the terms of the contract.  Pricing of Upgrades - The pricing of upgraded item(s) shall be negotiated on a case by case basis provided that the final price shall not exceed the limitations specified above.  Delivery of Upgrades - Notwithstanding the delivery requirements set forth in section C, initial delivery requirements for upgraded items shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties to this contract at the time the upgrade item is added.  The Contracting Officer shall have the right to set the delivery schedule based on the longer of the standard commercial delivery schedule of the item(s) or the contract's standard delivery schedule for similar item(s), if a mutually agreed schedule cannot be met.  After the first 60 days, the original contract schedule for delivery takes effect if it is less than the initial agreed upon delivery time.  Identification of Technologically Advanced Products - While the Government reserves the right to independently solicit a proposal from the Contractor under the terms of this clause at any time, potential upgrades will normally be brought to the attention of the Government by the Contractor. Solicitation documents are not available.  Contact Gary Hopkins (202)324-3819 for information regarding this solicitation
