<DESC>The distinct population segment of bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, in the St. Mary-Belly River drainage, east of the Continental Divide in Northern Montana, was "listed" as a threatened "species," under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, in 1999. Reclamation's Great Plains Regional Office intends to solicit quotations for a detailed and statistically valid description of baseline characteristic for the bull trout population in the St. Mary River basin. The work under the solicitation will consist of the furnishing of all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, training, and other items and incidental services necessary to satisfactorily compile, analyze, and describe all data collected between 1997 and 2013 as specified in the associated Performance Work Statement.
<p>The Government strongly urges offerors to inspect the Government-furnished materials and to satisfy themselves regarding all conditions that may affect the cost of performance. Failure by prospective offerors to inspect the summaries of each data set will not relieve the offerors from the responsibility of properly estimating the difficulty and cost of successfully performing the work in accordance with the Government's requirements. Detailed information regarding the Government-furnished materials will be included in the solicitation. At a minimum, Reclamation will address the following information:<br />&bull; Purpose/Description of the Data Collection <br />&bull; Number of Years of Data<br />&bull; Brief Description of the Labels for Each Data Field in a Database<br />&bull; Number of lines of Data in each Database</p>
<p>Pursuant to Part 12 and Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Reclamation intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) on or around November 25, 2014. Quotes will be due on or around December 29, 2014 at the Reclamation's Great Plains Regional Office, 2021 4th Avenue North, Billings, Montana. The anticipated period of performance is from January 15, 2015 through March 15, 2016.</p>
<p>The estimated price range of this acquisition is between $25,000 and $100,000.</p>
<p>Reclamation anticipates issuing the RFQ under full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit a quote. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the associated Small Business Size Standard is $15.0 Million.</p>
<p>The RFQ will be available for viewing through electronic commerce. Reclamation will issue RFQ Number R15PS00018 via https://www.fbo.gov, at the link provided in this notice. Interested vendors may also check https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/Default.htm. The RFQ and any subsequent amendments and/or notices will be available to vendors on these websites after November 25, 2014.</p>
<p>SAM: Effective July 29, 2012, any contractor interested in doing business with the federal government must register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award of a contract or agreement. SAM is a federal government owned and operated free website, which consolidated the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).</p>
<p>IPP: Payment requests for the anticipated contract must be submitted electronically through the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Internet Payment Platform System (IPP). If the contractor is unable to comply with the requirement to use IPP for submitting invoices for payment, the contractor must submit a waiver request in writing to the Contracting Officer with its proposal or quotation.</p>
<p>For further information about the requirement, offerors should contact Christine Mundt at cmundt@usbr.gov or at (406) 247-7805.</p>

<DESC>Description in English - On behalf of the Inter-American Foundation (IAF), an independent agency of the United States Government, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (FS) is seeking a contractor in Colombia to provide grant evaluator/data-verification services for Colombia. The IAF approves approximately six to eight grants per year per country. Grants are awarded for a one, two, or three-year period and typically include the following mandatory visits: an Evaluator orientation visit, a verification visit every six months or one year, and a final visit after the project has closed. Most grants are for a three-year period; therefore, over the life of a three-year grant the Contractor shall visit the grantee approximately six times.

<DESC>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of the National Weather Service's National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) for vessel services to provide transporting or towing vessel, crew, fuel, consumables, additional hawser, additional tag lines, and all materials required to retrieve the adrift NOAA 2.6-meter Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoy 2.6D58 and recover the adrift 3-meter weather buoy 3D41 and transport or tow them both to a port in the United States or foreign port if approved by NDBC in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW), dated November 6, 2014.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background Information:</span></strong> <br />NOAA deployed buoy hull 2.6D58 at DART station 42407 (230 nautical miles south of San Juan Puerto Rico) on May 28, 2014.  The buoy broke free of its mooring on September 9, 2014 and drifted westward.  The photos below show a similar buoy anchored on station and one being hoisted.  The buoy is normally lifted from the "teacup handle" ring on the aluminum structure above the deck.  Appendix 1 shows the mooring diagram for 2.6D58.  The cause of the mooring failure is unknown, so the actual adrift buoy may have any of this mooring material (except the anchor) still connected to the bottom of the 4-leg bridle. <br /> <br />Within 5 calendar days of the buoys' arrival at the dock, NOAA will send two technicians to the docking location to check all buoy compartments for hazardous atmosphere (oxygen and explosive gases) and make the compartments safe to open and enter. NOAA personnel will also remove the obstruction lights and position trackers. See attached Statement of Work (SOW), dated November 6, 2014, for additional information. Also, additional background information can be found on our website at: http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/.</p>

<a href="mailto:joy.m.slater@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Norfolk</a>
<DESC>By way of this Notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Norfolk District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announces its intentions to award on a sole source basis, a follow on Firm Fixed Price Architect-Engineering Contract to URS Corporation for the roadway and bridge related work of the AIWW bridge replacement at Deep Creek in Chesapeake, Virginia.  URS Corporation, as Designer of Record (DOR), is currently finalizing 90% design documents on a current contract for the AIWW Bridge Replacement project. <br>  <br> Through the issuance of Contract# W91236-06-D-0069, Task Order 0063, URS Corporation, as Designer of Record (DOR), continues to complete the base contract tasks.  The follow-on contract is necessary for URS Corporation to complete the design documents through 100% as well as to address evolving project requirements, as required.  Use of a different design firm would require reworking the entire 90% design effort, at a significant cost to the Government.  URS Corporation will not perform work for any other project or program under this specific contract action. <br>  <br> The work will consist of completing the development of construction bid documents, previously developed by URS Corporation and the Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk District for the roadway and bridge related work of the AIWW bridge replacement at Deep Creek in Chesapeake Virginia (W91236-06-D-0069-0063). Work will also consist of providing all necessary services and materials required to prepare and complete a biddable construction contract documents for the subject project.  Design documents will be sufficiently detailed to permit construction contractors to submit responsive bids without visiting the project site during bidding.  The design shall be prepared with the units of measurements currently in use. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: <br> The AIWW Deep Creek bridge, constructed in 1934, is a Federally owned and operated facility that passes over the Dismal Swamp Canal where U.S. Route 17 crosses at Deep Creek in the City of Chesapeake. The bridge is functionally obsolete because of its narrow roadway and poor alignment with the connecting roads, compounded by increasing traffic volumes.  The authorized plan identified in the 2001 feasibility report, is to replace the bridge with a five lane, split leaf pit bascule bridge.  The existing design calculations, plans, and supporting documents are at approximately 90% level of completion.  URS developed the full design under contract W91236-06-D-0069, Task Order 0063 issued on September 22, 2011 in the amount of $759,252.58.  Due to unforeseen funding problems and outstanding design elements, there are design elements that are not completed and additional work is required to complete the bid documents.   <br>  <br> The Classification Code for this procurement is North American Industry System (NAICS) 541330, with a small business size standard of $15 million. <br>  <br> This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers, proposals, etc.  However, all potentially responsible sources may submit a response NO LATER THAN the close of business on November 25, 2014.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Statements should be sent to the attention of Joy M. Slater at joy.m.slater@usace.army.mil; ensure that the subject line of your email included the title/description of this announcement. <br>  <br> Award is anticipated of said contract on or about December 24, 2014.  This announcement is posted in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The point of contact for this action is Joy M. Slater, 757-201-7145. <br>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of Bruker Fourier Spectrometer (Vertex 80v) Maintenance for 1 (one) base year plus 4 (four) option years. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 811219: Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance. Business size standard is for NAICS 811219 is $20,500,000.00.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Bruker Optics Inc., 19 Fortune Drive, Billerica, MA 01821. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Monday, 17 Nov 2014, 1000 EST. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires the maintenance and calibration services of the Vertex 80v by Bruker Optics Inc. because they are the only known source with the proprietary information, technical schematics, and certified replacement components which are authorized to perform these services. Additionally, Bruker Optics Inc. is the sole producer/manufacturer of the parts and they do not have distributors inside the USA that handle these parts or services.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to julie.hansen.1@us.af.mil no later than Monday, 17 Nov 2014, 1000 EST . Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "Spectrometer Maintenance". Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of 34 Thermodyne storage containers which will be used in the AFLCMC/EZPAA to store MQ-9 Passive Wingtip Antenna installation kits. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(i).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 332439. Size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />The proposed source is Thermodyne International LTD (INC), 1841 S Business Parkway, Ontario, CA 91761-8537. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received before 10:00AM, Eastern Time, 14 November 2014. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires Thermodyne storage containers will be used in the AFLCMC/EZPAA as a controlled breathing, long life, shipping and storage container for the MQ-9 Passive Wingtip Antenna Installation Kit. Thermodyne is the only manufacturer of the required container that has been proven to satisfy all requirements, passed strenuous qualification testing and can deliver the final product per AFPTEF drawing 201443250. To pass these standards, a container must maintain a water vapor-proof seal after being subjected to low and high temperature (-40 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) stack, shock and handle load tester per MIL-STD-648 and ambient sinusoidal and repetitive vibration test per MIL-STD-648.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 14 November 2014. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to Blaine.greenwalt@us.af.mil not later than 10:00AM, Eastern Time, 14 November 2014. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601-15-T-0044 Storage containers". Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

There is no solicitation available for this requirement.  Interested sources are encouraged to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities and FedConnect websites for future opportunities.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Request for Quote (RFQ) FA8629-15-Q-2300 is issued as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial equipment in support of the Battlefield Airman Management System (BAMS). A list of representative items is attached hereto. Please note that items to be procured may slightly change over the life of the program. This combined synopsis/solicitation is prepared in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and an additional solicitation will not be issued.
<p>1. Notice of Set-Aside:</p>
<p>This RFQ is issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The Government anticipates issuing multiple five-year Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to the contractors found capable of providing the attached list of items. No individual order placed against a BPA shall exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</p>
<p>2. Definition of Blanket Purchase Agreement:</p>
<p>A Blanket Purchase Agreement is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing charge accounts with qualified sources of supply. A Blanket Purchase Agreement establishes Terms and Conditions only. Award of a BPA will not guarantee subsequent placement of an order.</p>
<p>3. Delivery:</p>
<p>Delivery shall be made to the sites detailed on individual orders.</p>
<p>Delivery term shall be FOB Destination. The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the orders, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.</p>
<p>4. Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>The following terms and conditions apply. All provisions and clauses pertaining to this acquisition are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-77, effective 14 October 2014.</p>

A complete model contract containing CLIN structure and all terms and conditions is attached. <br /><br />5. Evaluation Criteria and Basis for Award:</p>
<p>a. Evaluation: <br /><br />Award will be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: <br /><br />(1) Technical Capability: Meeting the Requirement<br />(2) Past Performance, and <br />(3) Price.</p>
<p>b. Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Ability to provide the stated items constitutes acceptable technical capability. Due to the voluminous nature of the list, the Government acknowledges that limited sources might be available capable of providing the list in its entirety. As these BPAs will be issued with the goal of establishing a suitable base for order-level competition, BPAs may be issued to contractors that are only capable of providing some of the list.</p>
<p>c. Past Performance: <br /><br />The Government will evaluate past performance as it pertains to providing similar items. Examples of representative past performance are requested. Lack of representative past performance will not be viewed negatively or be utilized as a discriminating factor.</p>
<p>d. Price: <br /><br />Price evaluation will occur on a comparative item-by-item basis.</p>
<p>6. Line Items: See attached requirements document for a complete list of anticipated BAMS equipment items. Contractors are encouraged to propose alternate items if they believe substitution justified. Alternative items must be clearly denoted as such and marked with the legend "Alternate Item" and reference the replaced item. Please note, the BAMS list is subject to change to reflect real-world developments. As requirements change over the life of the BPA, each individual contractor will be notified.</p>
<p>7. NAICS:</p>
<p>The following NAICS code and small business size standard apply.</p>
<p>NAICS: 315990<br />Size Standard: 500 Employees</p>
<p>8. Capabilities Package:</p>
<p>All interested contractors should provide a capabilities package that documents their ability to provide the required items. The capabilities package should be brief and concise and include pricing and, when available, item lead-time information. All submitted prices are to be in accordance with established GSA Federal Supply Schedules. BPA's will be issued to vendors who offer the overall best value to the Government. Best value will be determined upon a lowest-price, technically acceptable basis.</p>
<p>Include in your capabilities package your DUNS, Cage Code, and System for Award Management expiration date.</p>
<p>9. Miscellaneous:</p>
<p>Please note that this procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). Pricing is required to be in accordance with established GSA Federal Supply Schedules. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant BPA, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract.</p>
<p>This is an Open-Market Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award 5 or more BPAs as a result of this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation that will include the terms and conditions that are set forth herein.</p>
<p>10. Questions:</p>

<p>(a) Each service employee, laborer, or mechanic employed in the United States (the 50 States and the District of Columbia) in the performance of this contract by the prime Contractor or any subcontractor, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the Contractor and service employee, laborer, or mechanic, shall be paid not less than the applicable minimum wage under Executive Order 13658. The minimum wage required to be paid to each service employee, laborer, or mechanic performing work on this contract between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015, shall be $10.10 per hour.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall adjust the minimum wage paid under this contract each time the Secretary of Labor&rsquo;s annual determination of the applicable minimum wage under section 2(a)(ii) of Executive Order 13658 results in a higher minimum wage. Adjustments to the Executive Order minimum wage under section 2(a)(ii) of Executive Order 13658 will be effective for all service employees, laborers, or mechanics subject to the Executive Order beginning January 1 of the following year. The Secretary of Labor will publish annual determinations in the Federal Register no later than 90 days before such new wage is to take effect. The Secretary will also publish the applicable minimum wage on www.wdol.gov (or any successor website). The applicable published minimum wage is incorporated by reference into this contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contracting Officer will adjust the contract price or contract unit price under this clause only for the increase in labor costs resulting from the annual inflation increases in the Executive Order 13658 minimum wage beginning on January 1, 2016. The Contracting Officer shall consider documentation as to the specific costs and workers impacted in determining the amount of the adjustment.</p>
<p>(d) The Contracting Officer will not adjust the contract price under this clause for any costs other than those identified in paragraph (c) of this clause, and will not provide price adjustments under this clause that result in duplicate price adjustments with the respective clause of this contract implementing the Service Contract Labor Standards statute (formerly known as the Service Contract Act) or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute (formerly known as the Davis Bacon Act).</p>
<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e) in all subcontracts.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.
<p>This solicitation is a "Request for Quotation" and being competed under FAR Part 6.1, Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-77, effective October 14, 2014.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325411 with a small business size standard of 750 of employees.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Sub-Part 52.211-6, this is a "BRAND NAME OR EQUAL" requirement.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health, Office of Purchasing and Contracts, is seeking to purchase Brand Name or Equal Human Growth Hormone Releasing Factor (GRF), (1-44) as described in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>All interested and qualified businesses are encouraged to provide a quotation/offer.<br /><br /><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) is a clinical research hospital providing all medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the NIH. The CC provides patient facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related areas and supervises residency and other training programs. The NIH Clinical Center Pharmacy Department provides pharmaceutical care and dispenses medications to inpatient and outpatients enrolled on clinical investigational studies. Clinical Center pharmacists provide research support to health care providers and investigators. Pharmacy staff members conduct and participate in research programs that enhance knowledge regarding optimal dosing and appropriate use of investigational and commercially available agents. The Pharmacy Department's Pharmaceutical Development Section manages investigational drug inventories through a computerized information system, prepares customized investigational drug products, and assists investigators in filing Investigational New Drug (IND) applications with the FDA.</p>
<p>Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)</p>
<p>Section 501 [21 U.S.C. &sect; 351] (a) (2) (B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires the methods, facilities, and controls used for the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and holding of drug products to conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) in order to ensure the safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drugs produced. The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has general rulemaking authority to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement of the act. The FDA regulates pharmaceutical manufacturing through the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), specifically the following sections:</p>
<p>21 CFR Part 210 Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Processing, Packing, Or Holding Of Drugs; General Part <br />21 CFR Part 211 Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals<br />21 CFR Part 600 Biological Products: General Part</p>
<p>The FDA further discusses procedures and practices to meet cGMPs through various venues, including the publication of Guidance for Industry documents, several of which are applicable to the operations that take place in PDS. Two very relevant and important guidance documents include cGMP for Phase I Investigational Drugs and Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing - cGMPs.</p>
<p>The requirement for maintenance and cleaning of pharmaceutical process systems and equipment are clear (21 CFR 211.67 Subpart D and FDA guidance and inspection documents) and linked to the regulations through these documents and venues.</p>
<p>Regulatory Requirements for PDS Operations</p>
<p>PDS engages in the manufacture, packaging, distribution, and holding of drugs and drug products for Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, and contributes to the submission of IND applications to the FDA. <br />The FDA makes clear that an investigational drug for use in a Phase 1 study is subject to the statutory requirements set forth at 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). Drugs for Phase 2 or Phase 3 study must comply with all regulations set forth by 21 CFR 210-211.</p>
<p>As such, PDS is subject to the regulatory authority of the FDA and must operate under cGMP conditions. Additionally, vendors providing equipment or services to PDS must know, understand, and apply cGMP conditions since PDS is reliant upon the manufacturer or service provider to meet many of the required quality aspects of the goods or services provided.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>In many cases the Pharmacy is required to find a suitable source for raw materials needed to produce the drug dosage forms needed to complete the goals of approved clinical trials. The Pharmacy has made many hundreds of purchases over the years and the practices employed are, in most cases reviewed by the FDA. In effect, on hundreds of occasions, the FDA has agreed that Pharmacy has made a proper choice in this regard. The judgement, based on experience, of members of the Pharmacy who make these selections is a primary factor in the decision process. <br />Other factors to be considered in these selections are compendial specifications and designation (inclusion in the United States Pharmacopeia or National Formulary, U.S.P./N.F. or in foreign equivalents), the issue of whether the chemical was made under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) as defined by the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) or, in some cases, the recognized available grade of the material, e.g. - food grade or analytical grade for example.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>&bull; The GRF 1-44 needed must be at least 98% peptide pure.<br />&bull; It must be a white powder.<br />&bull; It must attain a solubility in water of at least 1 mg/mL.<br />&bull; It must have a specific rotation value at C=0.1 in water at 20 degrees C in 1% <br />&bull; Acetic acid of approximately -78.99 degrees.<br />&bull; The molecular weight must be 5040.4<br />&bull; The peptide must be certified as being prepared under cGMP conditions and be labeled as such.<br />&bull; A reference standard must be available from the source so that analytical comparison can be made.<br />&bull; A certificate of analysis showing the specifications for acceptance of the provided material and the actual values found in testing must be provided.</p>
<p>FOR ALL TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND QUOTATION INSTRUCTIONS, PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT:<br /><br />"Growth Hormone Releasing Factor (GRF), (I-44) Synopsis/Solicitation."</p>

Some of the spoil will be used to fill in the 900' drainage ditch to the SW and the 300' shallow waterway to the NW. Approximately 6203 cu. yds. of spoil will be trucked offsite.</p>
<p>Each tile outlet along the river will have the tile line removed 100' to the south from the field edge. Deep spoil piles cover outlet and tile location from the river and within the wooded area making tile removal in that area difficult which is why the tile break will start at the edge of the field. Locations of undetermined tile are shown on plan and shall be defined by tile investigations. Tile investigation and tile abandonment area shall be marked out by NRCS.</p>
<p>There will be an area along the south, south east, and east part of the property that will not be contracted and is off limits to construction equipment. It is marked as "Easement Exclusion Area" on the plan view in the construction plan.</p>
<p>Any permits for hauling spoil from the WRP project site and to any offsite spoil deposit area is the contractor's responsibility.</p>
<p>PROJECT PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 26 calendar days.</p>
<p>SITE SHOWING: A site showing will be conducted Tuesday, 11/18/14, at 10:00 am. See Attachment 5, Site Map, for participant meeting location and driving directions</p>

The consultant will not be serving as a technical advisor to the GOM.<br /><br />An industrial land component of the second Compact is expected to include technical assistance and pilot-testing to help Morocco develop and mainstream improved approaches to mobilizing, developing, and allocating industrial land. This is expected to strengthen the productivity of industrial land and the performance of the industrial share of Morocco's economy.<br />Topics to be targeted in an eventual project include: legal and regulatory texts governing industrial land development; tax incentives and subsidy mechanisms related to industrial land development, ownership, and use; different tenure regimes for industrial land (sales, leasing, etc); roles, responsibilities and performance of State institutions related to allocation, mobilization, or management of industrial land; the enabling environment for private investors and private real estate developers to participate in the mobilization and development of industrial land; and mechanisms for understanding and projecting demand for industrial land by different types of firms; mechanisms for management of industrial land areas and financing and management of shared services; and assessment of viability of existing zones and identification of mechanisms to revitalize or convert to other uses.<br /><br />Services under this consultancy provide MCC with support in i) identifying feasible, detailed activity components to respond - systemically, and over the long term - to root causes of the industrial land problems being targeted by a Compact project or activities; ii) helping MCC provide best-practice guidance to the GOM in designing the specific components of land-related activities proposed; iii) helping MCC work with the GOM to conduct private sector engagement and identify potential PPP solutions; iv) identifying data/information needs which should be pursued by the GOM during the Compact development process to aid in formulation of appropriate ERR models for an MCC project; v) reviewing and advising MCC on program design documents; and potentially, vi), providing support in implementation oversight.<br /><br />The consultant shall support MCC by conducting technical review and analysis of land-related projects/activities in Morocco, and potentially in other MCC eligible countries.

<DESC>This project is a Design/Bid/Build Project.  The project consists of construction of a new Fort Campbell High School.  The MULTI story structure will be comprised of approximately 184,232 square feet.  The project will utilize clear span or similar construction methods to allow large, open, flexible spaces and will incorporate fully integrated acoustical rated operable wall partitions which contribute to the overall acoustical performance of the building.   The project will include 21st Century School concepts such as learning neighborhoods, central hubs surrounded by learning studios, flex labs, information center, gymnasium, food service area, computer lab, supply areas, specialist rooms, art room, music room, a performance theatre, commons area for dining and social networking, learning impaired room, teacher work rooms, counseling areas, storage, administrative offices and other required areas for a fully functioning facility.  The project also includes related infrastructure such as parking areas, mechanical rooms, delivery areas, covered walkways, playgrounds and site improvements.  The facility will require enhanced commissioning upon completion to validate energy performance and must obtain LEED Silver certification.  The contract duration is anticipated at 760 calendar days.  The estimated price range is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.  <br>    <br>  This solicitation is a Request for Proposal (RFP).  THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED PROCUREMENT.

Contracting Activity:<br />Washington Headquarters Services/Acquisition Directorate (WHS/AD)<br />1155 Defense Pentagon<br />Washington, DC 20301-1155<br />Requiring Activity:<br />Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense<br />Installations &amp; Environment/Environment, Safety &amp; Occupational Health<br />(ODUSD(I&amp;E)/ESOH)<br />3400 Defense Pentagon<br />Washington, DC 20301-3400<br />II. Description of Action for Approval<br />The purpose of this action is to exercise a six month extension using FAR 52.217-8 "Option to Extend Services" for Contract Number HQ0034-12-A-0032-0002, Legacy Program Support Services. The contract was awarded on 12 September 2013 with an 11-month base period and one three-month option period as shown below:<br />Base Period: 12 September 2013 - 11 August 2014<br />3-Month Option: 12 August 2014 - 11 November 2014<br />FAR 52.217-8 "Option to Extend Services" was included in the contract at time of award; however explicit evaluation of associated price was not performed. The three-month option period expires on 11 November 2014. The six month option will extend the completion date to 11 May 2015. There is an ongoing need for the services being provided and the contracting office is currently working with the requiring activity to finalize the requirements package so that an appropriate competition can be conducted and the follow-on effort can be procured.<br />III. Description of Services Required<br />The effort will provide the following services:<br />&#61623; The contractor shall provide technical, analytical, and administrative support to manage the DoD Legacy Program, including evaluating natural and cultural resources pre-proposals, proposals, and project deliverables.<br />Page 2 of 4<br />ODUSD(I&amp;E)ESOH, HQ0034-12-A-0032-0002-04<br />&#61623; The contractor shall conduct strategic planning and review, develop recommendations to improve DoD Legacy Program policy and guidance documents, and provide deliberative input to program and budget priorities.<br />Estimated Value of the Extension IAW FAR 52.217-8: $176,094.74<br />Period of Performance: 12 November 2014 until 11 May 2015<br />IV. Statutory Authority and Rationale for Authority Cited:<br />The authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), "Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because of supplies or services are unique or highly specialized."<br />This requirement is a follow-on to contract HQ0034-12-A-0032-0002, which has a performance period of an 11-month base period and one three-month option period and is valued at $404,920.00. The requiring activity attempted to consolidate this follow-on requirement with another ODUSD(I&amp;E) requirement for Natural Resources Program Support in order to implement the most efficient and effective way to support ODUSD(I&amp;E)/ESOH's mission. However, it was determined that the consolidation would not save more than 10% and therefore it required two separate contracts. As a result, there is insufficient time to compete and award the new follow-on contract for Legacy Resource Management Program Support on time.<br />Due to this circumstance, WHS/AD does not have sufficient time to effectively compete the requirement. BAH is the only company that is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required it the short amount of time available. If there is a break in service, ODUSD(I&amp;E) would be unable to complete the following tasks on time:<br />&#61623; Complete the evaluation and prioritization of 90 FY Legacy proposals<br />&#61623; Prepare summary spreadsheets for front office and legal review and approval<br />&#61623; Initiate the timely processing of proposals selected for funding<br />&#61623; Respond to queries from more than 150 current project Principal Investigators, and an additional 35-40 potential principal investigators; review final products and ensure timely close-out.<br />&#61623; In addition, these impacts would cause a delay in the initiation of the FY 16 Legacy cycle.<br />Mission failure in these areas is unacceptable as it would have a detrimental effect on ODUSD(I&amp;E)'s ability support to manage the DoD Legacy Program.<br />Page 3 of 4<br />ODUSD(I&amp;E)ESOH, HQ0034-12-A-0032-0002-04<br />V. Best Value Determination<br />The prices were determined fair and reasonable for the initial period of performance at time of award. The six month extension will be using the same unit price of $28,615.79 per month.<br />VI. Market Research<br />Market research is currently non-applicable for the six (6) month extension. Because BAH is already performing the work, they will be able to continue performing it in the time allowed.<br />VI. Requirements &amp; Pricing Analysis<br />Based on a review of GSA schedule labor category rates (or category equivalency rates) in the original competition, the prices for similar services were estimated to be substantially higher when compared to the BPA sources. If the government were to use a source other than BAH, the combined additional price could increase, regardless of whether or not the requirement is competed. This is because the price to extend services is based on 2013 rates. Consequently, it is unlikely that that further competition or discounts would reduce their prices significantly. Finally, even if discounted, the total cost to the Government would include additional administrative costs and inefficiencies that likely could not be recouped through competition.<br />In light of the above, it is in the best interest of the government to limit our requirement to one source; this is true both for the quality of the service provided and the price associated with the service.<br />VIII. Actions to Increase Competition<br />The six month extension will allow for better market research and expand the search for qualified contractors that are able to perform the work required. It is essential that competition is increased and the six month extension will allow for that time.<br />IX. Contracting Officer Certification<br />I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />________________________________ _______________<br />Julie M.
