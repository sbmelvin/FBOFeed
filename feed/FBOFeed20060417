<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, FL is contemplating a sole source firm fixed price contract to McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Boeing Company, J.S. McDonnell Blvd, Saint Louis, MO 63166.

The requirement is for the Programmable Armament Control Set (PACS) Test Station as an upgrade to the current F-15E Operational Facility (OPFAC) Operator’s Test Console (OTC) at the Eglin AFB, Florida Datalinks Test Facility (DTF) by February 2008. The PACS Test Station will enable a weapons testing capability for the Fighter Data Link (FDL)/Link-16. The current F-15E OPFAC supports only datalink testing on the F-15E aircraft and integration testing of the FDL and Class II family of Link-16 terminals. When this upgrade is completed the added capability would be used for datalink testing on aircraft stores carried on the F-15 aircraft, weapon integration testing, simulated weapons testing, stand-alone subsystem testing, joint interoperability and weapons certification, and investigation and resolution of critical and non-critical operational issues. Specifically, the PACS Test Station will provide the power, cooling and the necessary interconnect wiring for the following PACS station main hardware: host PC (station control); Versa Module Eurocard (VME) chassis (WISE – Weapon Integration and Simulation Environment); real weapon support, including the weapon station disconnect panel and Conformal Fuel Tank (CFT) air-to-ground stores interface; power control and distribution, to include the Power Distribution Unit (PDU), power panels, and power hub; signal hub; PACS cooling fixture and Electronic Sequencing Unit (ESU) holding fixture; test point panels; and integration panels. The PACS Test Station must allow connection of pylons, launchers, and weapons racks. In addition, an optional CFT breakout box for 1760 bus stores testing of six positions will be included. In order to provide an integrated testing platform, the PACS Test Station shall be fully integrated with the existing F-15E OPFAC OTC at Eglin’s DTF.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not the Government’s intention to pay for information solicited at this time. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Boeing is the only company that builds F-15E aircraft, and they are the only company that also builds the PACS Test Station for the F-15E OPFAC.

Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Stacey Hughes, Stacey.hughes@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-0190, FAX (850) 882-4561 or Contracting Specialist, Lt. Brian Hurley, brian.hurley2@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-0179. Technical questions should be directed to the Program Manager, Mr. Daniel Holmes, daniel.holmes@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-0783.     Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a requirement to purchase a minimum of twenty-one (21) mini tower workstation with dual Xeon CPU's, (2) 250GB hard drives, DVD Burner, 19" display+ (See attached for specifications).  Also required is the purchase of a minimum of twenty-one (21) mini tower computers Pentium 4, 250GB SATA-III, DVD burner and (2) 19" display+ (See attached for specifications).  These computers will be used in a network video data storage and collection system.  The dual processor computer will be the main device that collects and records digital network video from a number of different network camera systems.  It requires processing power to support the critical function of processing all the real time video data being sent to the computer.  Once data has been collected, it can be provided to remote users and system devices at the quickest rate that the system's remaining resources allow.  The second computer is used in conjunction with the video collecting computer.  Depending upon system loading, either computer may act as the central video monitoring station, where multiple video signals can be viewed on dual display monitors.  The second computer may be used to provide network support functions and/or support the dual display monitors.  With the secondary computer being used in the dual monitor mode, the dual processor computer will be free of the need to support video displays and will have more computational resources available to process additional video streams.  Thus both computers are equipped to handle dual video displays, but display are being procured to only allow one of the two units to have a second display.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is DEA-06-ST-0206(Q) and this is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  All items will be delivery to Lorton, VA  22079 within 45 days after receipt of order.

The FLH is seeking proposals for the development and delivery of a new software application, the Engineer’s, Estimating, Bidding, Award and Construction System (EEBACS), intended to replace the Engineers’ Estimate System and Construction Progress Payment Systems currently in use.  Proposals shall address the offeror’s ability to apply current software engineering technology and best practices to develop a web-based, multi-tier relational database system that is scalable, standards based, and secure.  Proposals must demonstrate that the EEBACS can be made fully compatible with future operating system and database software modifications for the life of the contract, and shall include a comprehensive maintenance plan for configuration and change management. 

System Architecture Overview: Design EEBACS as a multi-tiered, web-based system,
with the following specific requirements:  Data tier: a relational database; Middle tier: EEBACS business logic; Client tier: user interface providing access for system administrators and end users. 

System Architecture Requirements: Data tier requirements: relational database using Oracle 10g or later. Provide that the data tier reside on a separate server and be capable of using real-time replication, or other Oracle-approved method for replicating data across a wide-area network. The data tier must be platform-independent and must support communications using Oracle Net8/SQLNet or ODBC over TCP/IP.  Application tier requirements: Include any intelligence, management, processing, or other application services in EEBACS business logic or rules in the application tier. The application tier may be composed of multiple services or daemons running on a single server, or may run on individual servers as needed to distribute the application load.

This acquisition is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541512 with a small business size standard of $23.0 million.  The award is anticipated to be a performance-based, fixed price award for the development of the software and will contain labor hour provisions.  Options will be included for system maintenance. Award will be made to the offeror that provides the overall best value to the Government through evaluation of their technical solution (development and maintenance), experience of the firm, past performance, staffing and key personnel assigned, and capacity.  All evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  

The Request for Proposals and any attachments will be available on or about May 1, 2006 at the Central Federal Lands web site at http://www.cflhd.gov/.  Click on the Procurement Tab, Current Solicitations, Solicitations-Other.  CFLHD anticipates a 30 proposal preparation period after the RFP is issued.

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration is looking for a  contractor that shall furnish the necessary personnel, labor, parts, materials, service, tools, rigging and all ancillary equipment required to perform all the tasks necessary for, or incidental to, the performance of Preventive Maintenance/Inspection Services, Remedial Maintenance and Repairs on the newly installed three (3) Solar Turbine 130 Generator units located in the Utility Building at the Social Security Administration, National Computer Center, 620l Security Boulevard, Woodlawn, Maryland 21235.  Service shall be for a twelve (12) month period.  The GSA shall procure these services using FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  Services shall include monthly, semi-annual and annual inspections of various equipment components to ensure their continued sound operation, as well as as-needed repairs or emergency services caused by equipment failures.  Preventive maintenance and inspection services shall be performed at regularly scheduled intervals.  During the twelve month period  there shall be ten (10) operational inspections - it is anticipated that each inspection shall allow for 2 days on-site services by one technician with the use of additional technicians, if necessary,  one (1) semi-annual inspection - it is anticipated that each inspection shall allow for 8 days on-site by at least 2 technicians; and one (1) annual inspection - it is anticipated that each inspection shall allow for 20 days on-site by at least 2 technicians.  As part of these services, the contractor shall also perform "corrective maintenance."  Corrective maintenance is defined as the correction of any discrepancy (ies) that can be accomplished during a regularly scheduled inspection.  These corrections shall include those discrepancies discovered during the inspection or identified by the customer, and reviewed with the contractor, prior to the inspection based on entries made in the government-maintained equipment malfunction/problem log book.  Trouble calls and/or emergency services are defined as unscheduled requests for the services of a technician to correct any equipment malfunction.  Trouble calls and/or emergency services shall be provided at no additional cost to the government.  The contractor shall have a Solar Turbine factory-certified trained service personnel available within a four (4) hour response time to the National Computer Center.  In the event that the response time is longer than four (4) hours, the contractor may be assessed a monetary deduction.  The Turbine Generator units shall be maintained at an acceptable level throughout the contract performance period.  An "acceptable level" of performance is defined as that level of operation and maintenance which will preserve the equipment, and its systems in unimpaired condition and above the point where deterioration will begin, thereby ensuring that the normal life expectancy of the equipment will not be diminished.  The contractor is responsible for performing scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, repairs and testing as required by Solar maintenance standards and SSA requirements, including trouble and/or emergency call-back service.  The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining an inventory of all consumable supplies and necessary spare parts and/or for obtaining such parts in meeting the service requirements of the contract.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Military Sealift Command (MSC) Engineering Directorate requires non-personal services in the areas of marine engineering, naval architecture, electrical and electronics engineering, maintenance engineering, shipboard testing and inspections and failure analysis.  The work is varied and the contractor will be required to provide a wide range of engineering services to support the operation and maintenance of MSC ships.  Some examples of work to be performed may include narrowly defined tasks relating to an individual ship, such as revision of a docking plan, addition of specific galley equipment, a finite element analysis of a specific area, the survey of the entire HVAC system, rerouting a sewage system, revision of an electric one line drawing, or a load analysis on the power distribution system.

The Contracts Department at Naval Air Warfare Center - Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA, has a requirement to procure brand name  Polycom VSX7000 Video Teleconferencing Units,  VSX 7000S IP NTSC - 7 units, VSX 8000 Series QBRI  Mod w/CBL - 3 units, VSX 7000E IP w/PowerCam-Inc PCAM 3 units  and  VSX 7000 Quad BRI Mod-CBL Incl 7 units. FOB Destination pricing only.  Questions resulting from this synopsis/solicitation must be received not later than six (10) days prior to the closing date (email them to josie.babcock@navy.mil).  Offer must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offer Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, and 52.219-1 Small Business Program Representations.  This requirement is brand name because of the following reason. The Polycom VSX7000 Video Teleconferencing Units will be installed at various locations at the Point Mugu and China Lake Ranges.  These units are replacements for the aging and failing Picturetel Venue 2000 and Picturetel 970 systems currently in place.  VTCs are used extensively in the Navair organization for cross-site and multi-site video conferencing and collaboration in an effort to reduce costs associated with travel. VTC units are inherently collaboration tools, all devices participating in the collaborative meeting must be compatible with each other.  When equipment brands and model begin to deviate, the result is always incompatibility problems and thus downtime and lost productivity.  To prevent such issues, the Navair Video Team has chosen and madated the Polycom VSX7000 as the standard VTC model for mid-large size conference rooms across the command.  The following FAR clauses also apply and are incorporated herein by reference:  52.209-6, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.219-22, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.232-33, 52.233-3, 52.233-4, 52.252-2, 52.252-6, 52.253-1, 252.204-7003, 252.204-7004 Alt A, 252.204-7006, 252.211-7003, 252.212-7001, 252.225-7001, 252.225-7002, 252.225-7016, 252.225-7036 Alt I, 252.232-7003, 252.232-7010, 252.243-7001, 252.246-7000, 5252.211-9502, 5252.232-9511, 5252.232-9513, 5252.246-9526.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP), Outcomes Research Branch (ORB) plans to procure on a sole source basis, for “Assessing and Validating National Quality Forum Indicators for Cancer Care Using the National Cancer Data Base” with American College of Surgeons (ACoS), 633 North Saint Clair Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611-3211.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 813920 and the business size standard is $6M.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  

The purpose of this request is to pilot test the reliability and validity of a subset of cancer care quality measures in colorectal cancer and breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, submitted to the National Quality Forum (NFQ) by the American College of Surgeon’s Commission on Cancer. The American College of Surgeons through their subsidiary the Commission on Cancer (CoC) developed the quality of care measures used in this contract and submitted them to the NQF consensus process.  Based on the intellectual property rights agreement with NQF, the American College of Surgeons hold ownership of these measure specifications during the measures testing process of this contract.  Because the project requires the measures testing work be done on a nationally representative sample of hospital-based cancer programs, the ACoS Commission on Cancer’s National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) is the only known source of cancer registry-based information containing such a sample.  To the NCI’s knowledge no other data system exists to collect the ACoS registry-based cancer measures with the same degree of scope (approximately 1,400 CoC-approved cancer programs), comprehensiveness (all the measure data elements are already coded in the system), and quality (these data elements have already been validated in pilot projects sponsored by the College).  The National Cancer Data Base is privately co-owned by the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society and is unavailable for this work to other public or private organizations.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, and has the support of the above listed partners, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM EST on April  26, 2006.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or sent via electronic mail to Karen Gardner at gardnerka@mail.nih.gov.  It is the vendors’ responsibility to call 301-402-4509 to insure all questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  NCI-60058-NE must be referenced on capability statements received in the contracting office.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The contractor shall provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment and labor necessary to maintain natural and cultural resource management data, a key component of the Integrated Natural and Cultural Resources Management Plans (INRMP and CRMP).   The requirement is to maintain the INRMP and CRMP which have been developed for Installation Management Agency, Europe (IMA EURO) installations.  A large amount of monitoring and spatial data, in the form of base maps, databases and various land manageme nt layers, exist for installations throughout IMA EURO. Army Garrison land managers do not have the technical ability to access and manipulate the data, so a need exists to consolidate this information into a single, coherent, usable source for all garriso ns compatible with U.S. Army data management standards.  Information such as grounds classification, land management practices, location of sensitive and protected resources, vegetation, aquifers, environmental hazards, etc. must be maintained as part of I MA EURO environmental management programs.  As another related requirement, IMA EURO needs to update and manage inventories of urban trees located on Army installations. Tree inventories are required integral parts of the Garrisons INRMP.  The IMA EURO Ur ban Tree Management System is also the primary tool used to meet legal requirements in Germany for the inspection and evaluation of all trees in an urban setting.  This tool not only assists in the management of this resource, but it is also critical in li miting and preventing damage caused from trees falling on people and property.  The data is managed with a database and GIS software to provide installation personnel with a quickly accessible tool for a more effective handling of the long-range planning, budget programming and management of that specific portion of their natural resources management program.   Additional Natural and Cultural Resource technical support is required by the IMA EURO Environmental Branch in environmental database management, ma nagement support for threatened and endangered species studies, Natura 2000 management and monitoring, and a regional environmental development constraint data archive. Web site administration and various other office automation tasks are necessary as requ ired.

<CONTACT>Phyllis Townsley, 405-954-7816
<DESC>Time and date specified for receipt of offers is hereby extended indefinitely.  An amendment will be issued at a later date to re-establish the closing date. Only those 8(a) vendors that are certified under the Small Business Administration (SBA) in Area VI (AR, LA, NM, OK, and TX) will be allowed to participate in this acquisition.  Refer to additional information provided in this Announcement/SIR1.   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for janitorial services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The general scope of work for these services will require the contractor to furnish all personnel, supplies, materials, and cleaning equipment in the performance of building janitorial services for approximately 3.0M square feet of office space, classrooms, etc., in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).   Requirements are further defined in the attached SOW.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options. This acquisition is set-aside exclusively for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.  Only those 8(a) firms that are certified under the SBA in Area VI (AR, LA, NM, OK, and TX) will be allowed to participate in this requirement.  To be considered, a vendor must be classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561720, Janitorial Services - $15/million.  Each firm claiming 8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this Announcement/SIR1.  Firms are to submit an FAA Business Declaration form with your response to this Announcement/SIR1.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each vendor's program eligibility. Should an 8(a) vendor intend to incorporate a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" shall apply to the prime contractor. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the Announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies that are certified under the 8(a) program with SBA within Area VI an opportunity to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this Announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this Announcement/SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this Announcement/SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 	1.  8(a) Certification and Business Declaration Form: 	(a) Provide certification letter from SBA documenting vendor's enrollment in the SBA's 8(a) program and classification as a small business under the North American Industry Classification system (NAIC) code 561720, Janitorial Service. 	(b) Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form. 2.  Past Performance and Experience: (Note: Past performance represents "how well" an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has "done it."  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the SOW.) 	(a) In order to be determined acceptable vendors must have a minimum of five (5) years experience in performing janitorial/custodial services as identified in the attached SOW.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.

The vendor's documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information stated below. (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the  	Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government  	contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX  	numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 	(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor's performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 3.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must demonstrate the capability to provide management and staffing commensurate with the demands of this requirement in the following areas: 	(a) Vendors must demonstrate that an on-site Project Manager, Supervisor and Shift Managers will be available at the time of contract award.

The documentation describing the individual's qualifications may include a brief synopsis or resume of work experience.  It should include present position or title, experience in managing contracts for similar services of scope and size (include duration or length of all experience), and educational/training background in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and management competence. 	(b) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 50 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to, a spreadsheet identified month by month for the annual period containing a list of employees and the contracts on which they performed or a signed certified list of employees with date of employment including employees managers and the manager's qualification.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to address questions posed by a prospective offeror:

QUESTION:  Could you tell us the footprint details of the (two?) existing mast interfaces with the HH65 tail cone? We have assumed that one of them is the Collins 437R-2 antenna footprint, but we don't know what the other one is.
ANSWER:  The Collins 437R-2 Monopole antenna (antenna feed) will be removed. The existing long wire antenna is terminated at the stinger (tail skid) with an insulator and a tension adjustor. The stinger is composite material with a metal skid plate on the bottom. This is not the location that we would terminate a towel bar antenna design (too susceptible to damage).

QUESTION:  Are you presently feeding the existing antenna from the front or from the back? 
ANSWER:  Front. Use of existing mount (removed 437R-2) at feed through is a possibility.

QUESTION:  Are the inner and outer metal skins of the tail cone aluminum alloy? If not, what are they?  We note that the SOW, figure 1-90, paragraph 2, indicates that "tail cone panels consist of an inner and outer metal skin with a nomex honeycomb material sandwiched between them. The individual panels are ELECTRICALLY INSULATED FROM ONE ANOTHER for corrosion prevention purposes". 
ANSWER:  The tail cone is nomex composite sheathed in aluminum skin. The fenestron is entirely composite. The statement in fig 1-90, paragraph 2 refers to individual panels such as the tail rotor drive shaft fairings, cowling, heat shield panels, etc.  

QUESTION:  What approach would you prefer to creating a suitable RF conduction loop?
ANSWER:   The Coast Guard is interested in recommendations and any data on previous installations using these techniques. The requirement is long range communication. Near Vertical Incident Skywaves (NVIS) is not the objective. The question is, when using HF frequencies on an ALE network, typically with 10 Channels in the 3-23 Mhz range (most at 9-23 MHz) which configuration would work best? Closed loop or open? 

QUESTION:  Does the geometry of the HH65 indicate it will be necessary to attach anything to the vertical fin? If so, does USCG have any preferred anti-corrosion process, such as ivadizing?
ANSWER:  To achieve the minimum 10 foot requirement the antenna will likely terminated at the fenestron (vertical fin). If a closed loop design is elected, recommendations on how to best achieve the required ground would be expected.  Mediation of corrosion issues fall under the purview of the Coast Guard, however experience and recommendations of attachment hardware are always welcome.

QUESTION:  Would it be possible to visit you to measure and photograph the applicable areas of a USCG HH65 before we complete proposal for your HF Towel Bar antenna?
ANSWER:  Site visits may be coordinated through Mr. Robert Vessey at (252)335-6711.

<DESC>The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) Office of Inspector General (OIG) plans to contract for actuarial support services in connection with its audit of the RRB’s FY 2006 financial statements.

The RRB’s financial statements are audited annually pursuant to the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002.  Effective with FY 2006 financial reporting, the statement of social insurance, previously presented as supplementary information, will become a basic financial statement subject to the auditor’s opinion.  As part of the audit, the OIG must evaluate the statement of social insurance for conformance with applicable guidance and determine whether the estimates contained therein are fairly presented in all material respects.  The statement of social insurance is prepared by the RRB’s Bureau of the Actuary at the agency’s headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.  The successful offeror will assist the OIG by performing tests of the work of the RRB’s actuary that are required to support the OIG’s opinion on the statement.

General Information about the RRB, its mission and statistical information, including the most recent actuarial valuation of program assets and liabilities is available at the RRB’s public website, WWW.RRB.GOV.  The statement of social insurance is prepared pursuant to the requirements of Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) #17, #25, #26 and #28 as issued by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) which are available at WWW.FASAB.GOV.  The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued a Statement of Position, 04-01, “Auditing the Statement of Social Insurance,” dated November 22, 2004, which is available from that organization.

The solicitation document will be available about January 12, 2006, and will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (Fed Biz Ops) website: WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV.

Hardcopies of the solicitation document will not be available.

All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will be distributed solely through the Fed Biz Opps website.

<DESC>The Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC) provided a sources sought announcement on 8 February 2006.  A detailed market research survey was available through 3 March 2006 for interested contractors to complete.  We received 93 responses to the survey.  With that overwhelming interest, it is taking longer to compile the market research information than originally expected; therefore, the program schedule is delayed at this time.

The plan, at this time, is still to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) and then hold an industry day so that interested contractors can provide feedback to the Air Force team.  The timeline for this phase of the program is tentatively set for 19 May through 7 June 2006.

<RESPDATE>050906
<ARCHDATE>07082006
<CONTACT>Phyllis Buerstatte, 509-527-7211
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) are considering a partnership with industry to develop a fish friendly turbine.  The goal of the project is to employ the latest technologies in turbine design and  assessment as a proof of concept to support fish friendly or environmental based designs.  The resulting prototype turbine would be a replacement installed at the Corps' existing Ice Harbor power station replacing Ice Harbor Unit 2.  The Corps is subm itting this inquiry to determine industry interest and to solicit industry comments on the potential design and acquisition process.       The Corps Walla Walla District expects to independently perform a preliminary series of design modifications of an existing Ice Harbor observational model turbine at our Waterways Experiment Station  Engineering Research and Development Center (WES-ERDC) facility prior to issuing a request for proposal to industry.  The purpose of this WES-ERDC preliminary investigation is to identify areas of the turbine and water passage with potential for performance and/or fish passage improvement.  The Corps anticipat es this information will be provided in the request for proposal to industry with boundaries placed on allowable changes or modifications to the structure and turbine.   We currently anticipate a contractor will be selected based on past performance, engineering and management capability, commitment to schedule, commitment to the overall project goals, technical approach and cost.  We expect a two phase process: Phase I, i nteractive and iterative design in association with the Corps through a negotiated cost plus fixed fee and/or incentive fee arrangement; Phase II, a negotiated fixed price or Fixed Price Incentive Fee for supply, field quality assurance and erection engine ering services of the final selected design with options for two additional prototypes. Phase I of the project would be the determination of the civil, hydraulic and mechanical design of the turbine water passages and runner.  The hydraulic design of the turbine water passages and the runner would be developed by a turbine manufacturing/desig n company with direct input from the Corps of Engineers design team.  The design process would be iterative in that conceptual design alternatives would be developed and evaluated utilizing the Corps physical hydraulic (observational) models in combinatio n with industry standard hydraulic performance models and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).  These investigations would be completed in a step-wise manner combining successes and eliminating failures.  Each alternative or feature would be evaluated for i ts environmental benefits, hydraulic performance, cost reasonableness and feasibility before selecting a final design.  Likely alternatives include, but are not limited to a minimum gap runner, a modified draft-tube optimized for high flow rates, modified stay vanes, modified wicket gates, hydraulically aligned stay vanes and wicket gates and a runner meeting requirements for overall pressure drop and maximum rate of pressure change.  The Government will own the final design of the prototype runner and may require the selected vendor to provide complete manufacturing drawings for use by the Government for future solicitations. Phase II of the project would consist of the supply of the collaborative prototype design developed under phase I.  A separate fixed price construction contract for installation of the final design as Government Furnished Equipment is anticipated to comple te the proof of concept design with technical input (erection engineer) provided by the Prototype contractor during installation to ensure correct installation. The Government is submitting this inquiry to (1) determine industry interest and (2) solicit industry comments regarding the proposed design, and acquisition process.  Please indicate your interest and submit any comments to Phyllis  Buerstatte, Contract Specialist, 201 N. Third Ave, Walla Walla, WA 99362 or by email to  Phyllis.L.Buerstatte@usace.army.mil  and Tracy.L.Wickham@usace.army.mil   Your response to this announcement should be received on or before May 09, 2006.

<DESC>USAID/Ethiopia announces its intention to invite comments and suggestions on a draft Statement of Work (SOW) for the implementation of a new Ethiopian Care and Support for Persons Living with HIV/AIDS contract. The goal of the contract is to focus on HIV/AIDS Care and Support at health centers and in communities in Ethiopia. The awarded contractor shall work in collaboration with current PEFFAR Ethiopia partners and in partnership with the Government of Ethiopia (GOE), in particular Regional Health Bureaus and woreda health offices, to provide HIV/AIDS care and support activities throughout Ethiopia. The focus of the three-year Contract (with two 1-year options) shall be at the health center level, in the community -- called kebeles in Ethiopia -- and with families.  Five results are to be achieved under this Contract based on several implementation modalities. New approaches for care and support are included under this Contract, most notably the deployment of case managers and Kebele Oriented Outreach Workers (KOOWs).

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS WILL NOT BE AN 8A SET ASIDE, BUT A FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  STAY TUNED FOR FULL SOLICITATION IN MAY 2006.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is seeking SMALL BUSINESSES capable of proposing on an incrementally-funded cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with a five (5) year period of performance beginning October 1, 2006, under NAICS Code 541720.  The existing contract #200-2001-00110, awarded to the Academy for Education Development in the amount of $3,662,794.00, expires September 30, 2006.  The date specified for receipt of proposals will be approximately 30 days after the issue date of the Request for Proposal (RFP) 2006-Q-08507, which is anticipated to be issued on or about May 12, 2006.  The RFP will be available only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov/  A wage determination has not been requested since the requirement involves meaningful numbers of professional employees as defined in FAR Subpart 22.11.  All responsible small businesses may respond to this notice and provide their experience and information on similar contracts performed by emailing Sam Jamison: esw2@cdc.gov. 

Background:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) seeks to prevent the most serious health risk behaviors among children, adolescents and young adults.  To accomplish this mission DASH implements four strategies: 1) monitors six categories of priority health risk behaviors and school health policies and programs to address them throughout the United States and its territories; 2) synthesizes research findings to identify policies and practices that are most likely to be effective in promoting healthy behaviors among young people. Research-based recommendations for school health programs are featured in a series of publications called the CDC guidelines for school health; 3) funds programs to enable its constituents to implement adolescent and school health programs; and 4) provides evaluation technical assistance (TA) to funded Non-Government Organizations and state and local agencies to help them evaluate the quality and effectiveness of their school health policy development and implementation, curriculum design, professional development activities, and program impact on students.  Most causes of health threats to children and youth are related to six behaviors including: (1) tobacco use; (2) dietary patterns that contribute to disease; (3) insufficient physical activity; (4) sexual behaviors that result in HIV infection, other sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and unintended pregnancy; (5) alcohol and other drug use; and (6) behaviors that result in unintentional injuries and violence.

Description of Work:
The Contractor, in collaboration with DASH and other contractors (including but not limited to those providing programmatic or technical services), shall (1) provide intensive program evaluation TA (ITA) by phone, e-mail, or in-person to selected DASH-funded partners; (2) develop and assess the usefulness of evaluation resources, reports, and tools (electronic, for presentation, and in print) to aid funded partners in conducting program evaluations through clear and consistent ITA messages; (3) promote, market and assess the usefulness of evaluation TA activities to DASH funded partners through development and distribution of marketing materials; (4)  plan, develop, implement, and follow-up on evaluation workshops and trainings as requested; and (5) develop and/or maintain a system by which records of program evaluation ITA will be shared with DASH staff, contractors, and funded partners.

<DESC>This Request for Information is for planning purposes only.  The Government anticipates issuance of a solicitation to provide services necessary to conduct powered flight training at the USAF Academy.  This training will be in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and an Air Education and Training Command (AETC) formal course syllabus.  The government will retain program oversight, but will not exercise direct supervision over the contractor’s employees except in the interest of safety or national emergency.  This oversight will consist of approximately ten military flight instructors (MFIs), including a Squadron Commander and Operations Officer.  The syllabus will consist of approximately 19 sorties and 25 hours, but is subject to modification as the needs of the Air Force change.  

The contractor shall provide all personnel, including certified flight instructors, aircraft, training aids, supervision, materials, maintenance, equipment and services necessary to perform flight training, except as specified in the Government Furnished Equipment list and the PWS.  In general, the government will provide the airfield, including hangar 
space, fuel service, air traffic control, fire and rescue service, training airspace between 12 and 60 NM from the Academy, and an auxiliary field 31 NM from the Academy.  

The contractor’s instructor pilots must hold a current Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) rating, have at least 200 hours of dual given, and must have at least two years experience as a CFI or military Instructor Pilot.  Previous experience as a rated military pilot is highly desirable.  The CFIs, upon completion of a contractor-designed local checkout program, will receive additional instruction from the government to teach the CFIs to provide instruction in a manner consistent with Air Force flight instruction, to include syllabus management and brief/debrief methods.  

The contractor’s choice of aircraft will meet the following specifications.  Note:  Potential aircraft will be flight tested at the USAF Academy airfield at a later date to validate performance due to the excessive density altitudes experienced at the airfield.
	- FAA certified for normal category or higher
	- Tri-cycle gear
	- 20-knot crosswind capability
	- Will maintain CG limits with a crew as light as a solo student weighing between
 	   113 and 277 pounds, or a dual crew up to 450 pounds
	- Ability to fly two 1.5-hour sorties plus required fuel reserves before refueling
	- Minimum climb rate of 600 fpm at 10,000 feet density altitude with 450 pounds 
	   of crew and the fuel specified above
	- Specified climb speed will be at least 10 KIAS above level flight stall speed at
	   maximum takeoff weight
	- Cruise speed of at least 125 KTAS at 10,000 feet density altitude with 450 
	   pounds of crew and the fuel specified above
	- Ability to perform a sustained 45° banked turn at 10,000 feet density altitude
	   with 450 pounds of crew and the fuel specified above
	- Ability to abort a takeoff at 10,000 feet density altitude, zero headwind, dry run-
	   way, 450 pounds of crew and the fuel specified above, after accelerating to 		   takeoff speed, delaying three seconds, and applying maximum braking, and 	  	   come to a stop within 3,500 feet of initiation of takeoff roll
	- Maximum dimensions of 37’5’ length, 39’8” span, and 9’10” height
	- Shall accommodate students 64” to 77” tall with sitting heights of 34” to 40”
	- Equipped with dual Comm, VOR, Mode C, GPS, audio panel, integral intercom,
 	   and traffic alert system
	- Overfly noise level not in excess of 82 dB, per FAR part 36
	- Maintains rudder and aileron effectiveness during stall, power on and off, clean 
	   and landing configuration, coordinated and uncoordinated
	- Meets minimum longitudinal static stability constraints:
		-- For stick controls, minimum of 0.12 pounds per knot from a trim 
		    speed of 100 KIAS through +/- 30 KIAS from trim
		-- For yolk controls, minimum of 0.25 points per knot from a trim speed 
		    of 100 KIAS through +/- 30 KIAS from trim
	- All flight and fuel controls, and circuit breakers must be accessible from both 
	   seats with seat belts / shoulder harnesses fastened
	- Walk-around inspection must be performed in a timely manner with all items
	   easily inspected
	- Operating Limits and critical action procedures easily obtainable from flight
	   manual

Desired aircraft characteristics:
	- 4 seats
	- Fuel burn rate not to exceed 12 gallons per hour
	- Nose wheel steering
	- 270° of horizontal field of view centered on nose of aircraft with minimal 
	   obstructions
	- Climb rate of 700 fpm under the afore-mentioned conditions
	- Aborted takeoff within 3000 feet of groundroll under afore-mentioned 
	   conditions
	- All aircraft instruments visible and accessible from both seats with seat belts 
	   and shoulder harnesses fastened

The contractor will be able to conduct a minimum of 11,750 hours of flight training for 470 students annually.  The contractor will provide the ability to provide an additional 2,000 hours annually after the phase-in period to cover possible syllabus modifications.  Most notably, the contractor will create an infrastructure capable of sustaining variations to student load based on a six-month advance workload estimate.  Once the estimate is provided, the contractor will honor short-term (within 30 days of class start date) variations of up to 10%.  The contractor must realize that graduating a class on time is of utmost concern.  As such, the contractor will have the ability to increase training output to compensate for falling behind the student timeline (for any reason).  The training will consist of 40 training days during the academic year, with students available for 4 hours and 15 minutes, which includes necessary travel time from the cadet area to the airfield and back.  During the summer, there will be 15 available training days, with students available the entire day while still complying with Air Force Instruction 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.  If the contractor requests to fly Saturday’s during the academic year, a request a minimum of 2-weeks prior must be provided.  1-week notice must occur for Saturday operations during the summer.

Interested offerors are invited to provide comments and questions.  Please direct contracting questions to Annabel Rivera, AETC Contracting Squadron, at annabel.riveria@randolph.af.mil.  Technical questions can be directed to Maj Wes Smith at wesley.smith@USAFA.af.mil or Maj JD Dillinger at joseph.dillinger@USAFA.af.mil.  Offerors are welcome to provide comments on the following issues:

1.  The Government anticipates a 90-day mobilization period.  Will a 90-day mobilization period be sufficient?

2.  The government anticipates to award a one-year Basic contract with nine one-year Option.  Will a one-year basic contract with nine one-year options be acceptable?

3.  Due to Congressional constraints, student loads will vary.  Is 6 months sufficient notice to adjust for student load projections?

4.  Offerors must be aware that the government expects operational flexibility sufficient to graduate classes on time regardless of downtime due to any factor such as weather.  On-time class graduations will be a key performance indicator.

5.  Request industry comments address suggestions on the pricing structure of the AFS program (i.e. per student, per semester, per flying hour).

The Healy is currently home ported in Seattle, WA.  Northrop Grumman, Sperry Marine is the original equipment manufacturer/integrator of the IBS.  The maintenance support contractor shall be required to maintain a quality program that complies with ISO-9001.  It is the Government's belief that only Northrup Grumman Corporation – Sperry Marine, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)/Integrator, can provide the support required, as the developer and proprietor of the Voyage Management System (VMS) software that enable integration of the IBS components, Sperry Marine, is the only known source with access to the software code to maintain the system.  Hardware and software interfaces for the subcontractor components were also designed and developed by Sperry Marine.  Sperry Marine considers the VMS software and component interfaces proprietary.  The Government does not own the technical documentation or software code needed to provide the required technical consultation or configuration management to support a competitive solicitation.  However, other potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are encouraged to identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement within 10 days from the date of this announcement. Other potential sources must submit a capability statement that sufficiently demonstrates qualification, capabilities, and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirements.  Capability statements shall include evidence that the company has access or will have access to Sperry Marine's proprietary software (e.g., signed agreement with Northrup Grumman Corp – Sperry Marine, licensing arrangement, etc.).  No cost or pricing data is required.  See Numbered Note 22.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.

<DESC>The Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC) is seeking sources to perform procured medical administrative support services in military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) at geographically-dispersed Air Force bases in the Continental United States and at many overseas bases.  The work may augment medical support services provided by Air Force military personnel, DoD civilian employees or other contract staff or could provide new capability to the MTFs.  However, the Government may opt to contract an entire service or operational activity within an MTF.   In this case, the purpose, scope, objectives and constraints will be provided to the contractor for the service under consideration in the form of a Statement of Objectives.   

Medical Administrative Support Services can be any occupation that engages in activities that support the operations of the medical facility.  Preliminary considerations are focusing the acquisition on a broad spectrum of occupations.  These staff members serve the MTF in administrative or informational processes that do not involve direct medical treatment or intervention.  These may include:  appointing, coding, medical records, transcription, medical education, patient administration (admissions/dispositions) and other medical administration positions supporting MTF missions and program management.  Medical Administrative Support Services does not include nutritional medicine (food service), medical equipment repair, housekeeping, information systems, or facility maintenance.

Background:  Currently, these medical administrative support services are procured when needed by each MTF using a local base contracting office, other contracting offices at other bases, centralized contracts and other non-agency contracts for similar personnel.  The mission of the AFMSCC is to develop a strategic purchasing plan for the Air Force’s future medical administrative support service requirements that is efficient and effective.  The goal is to leverage resources, define common specifications and improve efficiencies with strategically placed contracts or ordering instruments.  Because the AFMSCC just began development of the acquisition strategy, the number, scope and geographic coverage of each contract, the types of contract, and acquisition methodology has not been determined at this time.  The AFMSCC seeks to minimize impacts to existing small business contractors.  We are seeking large and small business sources as part of market research to ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity that small businesses can “bring to the table” for anticipated medical administrative support services requirements worldwide (outlined in the attached Labor Category table).  A review of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes finds NAICS 561110 (Office Administrative Services), and 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services) both have a size standard of $6.5M (3-year average annual receipts); however, they are not necessarily medical in performance.  621999 (All Other Miscellaneous Ambulatory Health Care Service) has a size standard of $9M.  We are seeking comments on our NAICS code selection as well.  

What the AFMSCC needs:  If you are an interested large or small business, please respond to the survey questions at the following link:  http://www.mcix.com/Surveys/TakeSurvey.asp?SurveyID=6ML9m3K08o20I
The survey can take 15-25 minutes depending upon the type of services offered by your company.  However, your willingness to provide the details requested will be invaluable to the Government’s during this planning phase.  Notice:  The AFMSCC has non-Government employees (i.e., contractor employees) assisting with market research.  These non-Government employees, who have all signed non-disclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.  Submitting your answers in the survey link above is the Government’s preferred data collection method.  Please complete the survey by 2 March 2006.

<ARCHDATE>07082006
<CONTACT>Phyllis Buerstatte, 509-527-7211
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) are considering a partnership with industry to develop a fish friendly turbine.  The goal of the project is to employ the latest technologies in turbine design and  assessment as a proof of concept to support fish friendly or environmental based designs.  The resulting prototype turbine would be a replacement installed at the Corps' existing Ice Harbor power station replacing Ice Harbor Unit 2.  The Corps is subm itting this inquiry to determine industry interest and to solicit industry comments on the potential design and acquisition process.       The Corps Walla Walla District expects to independently perform a preliminary series of design modifications of an existing Ice Harbor observational model turbine at our Waterways Experiment Station  Engineering Research and Development Center (WES-ERDC) facility prior to issuing a request for proposal to industry.  The purpose of this WES-ERDC preliminary investigation is to identify areas of the turbine and water passage with potential for performance and/or fish passage improvement.  The Corps anticipat es this information will be provided in the request for proposal to industry with boundaries placed on allowable changes or modifications to the structure and turbine.   We currently anticipate a contractor will be selected based on past performance, engineering and management capability, commitment to schedule, commitment to the overall project goals, technical approach and cost.  We expect a two phase process: Phase I, i nteractive and iterative design in association with the Corps through a negotiated cost plus fixed fee and/or incentive fee arrangement; Phase II, a negotiated fixed price or Fixed Price Incentive Fee for supply, field quality assurance and erection engine ering services of the final selected design with options for two additional prototypes. Phase I of the project would be the determination of the civil, hydraulic and mechanical design of the turbine water passages and runner.  The hydraulic design of the turbine water passages and the runner would be developed by a turbine manufacturing/desig n company with direct input from the Corps of Engineers design team.  The design process would be iterative in that conceptual design alternatives would be developed and evaluated utilizing the Corps physical hydraulic (observational) models in combinatio n with industry standard hydraulic performance models and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).  These investigations would be completed in a step-wise manner combining successes and eliminating failures.  Each alternative or feature would be evaluated for i ts environmental benefits, hydraulic performance, cost reasonableness and feasibility before selecting a final design.  Likely alternatives include, but are not limited to a minimum gap runner, a modified draft-tube optimized for high flow rates, modified stay vanes, modified wicket gates, hydraulically aligned stay vanes and wicket gates and a runner meeting requirements for overall pressure drop and maximum rate of pressure change.  The Government will own the final design of the prototype runner and may require the selected vendor to provide complete manufacturing drawings for use by the Government for future solicitations. Phase II of the project would consist of the supply of the collaborative prototype design developed under phase I.  A separate fixed price construction contract for installation of the final design as Government Furnished Equipment is anticipated to comple te the proof of concept design with technical input (erection engineer) provided by the Prototype contractor during installation to ensure correct installation. The Government is submitting this inquiry to (1) determine industry interest and (2) solicit industry comments regarding the proposed design, and acquisition process.  Please indicate your interest and submit any comments to Phyllis  Buerstatte, Contract Specialist, 201 N. Third Ave, Walla Walla, WA 99362 or by email to  Phyllis.L.Buerstatte@usace.army.mil  and Tracy.L.Wickham@usace.army.mil   Your response to this announcement should be received on or before May 09, 2006.

<SUBJECT>A -- ARRAY READER
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,  for a Bio-Plex 200 Array Reader.  The Bio-Plex Array Readers are instruments currently used by the Bioterrorism Response and Advance Technology Laboratory for the development and improvement of diagnostic assays.  Both nucleic acid-based and immunological assays will be developed using these instruments.  These assays are used by the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) for the rapid detection of biothreat agents.  It is required that we use advance technology for the development of quality assays, thus requiring the latest version of the instrument and accompanying software.  The vendor is the only supplier that can provide the instruments. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Beth West at llw5@cdc.gov

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITY.  NO PROPOSALS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

Announcement of New Consent-Based Social Security Number Verification (CBSV) Service by the Social Security Administration (SSA)

SSA is planning to offer a new service to any interested parties.  As long as the party first obtains the required written consent of the number holder, we will, for a fee, verify a name and Social Security number combination as being correct (or incorrect) for any party registered to use the service.  This fee-based, third party verification service should not be confused with the Social Security Number (SSN) verifications which SSA provides to employers and their agents for wage and tax reporting for hired employees.

There will be a substantial fee to register to use the service because Social Security Trust Fund monies cannot be used to develop this service.  This new service is contingent on OMB approval.  Currently, we anticipate a June 2006 start date for the service.  There will be a limited time for parties to enroll in this service.  Once the enrollment period ends, there could be as much as a 3-year wait before additional companies will be permitted to enroll.

Please see Federal Register Notice Social Security Administration:  Agency Information Collection Activities:  Proposed Request, dated December 30, 2005, for more information about this service and to request documents such as the User Agreement that the party would sign with SSA and the consent form that must be completed by the Social Security number holder prior to you being permitted to send a request for Social Security number verification to SSA for processing.  The direct link to the Federal Register Notice is: http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01jan20051800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/pdf/E5-8095.pdf

<SUBJECT>88 -- Supply 36 Head of Cattle for Plum Island Animal Disease Center
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, ARS, at the  Plum Island Animal Disease Center, Orient Point, New York, intends to negotiate solely with Thomas D. Morris Inc., 4001 Millender Mill Rd, Reisterstown, MD for the purchase of 36 head of cattle to be delivered during late April and May 2006.  In FY 2005 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funded the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) through a reimbursable agreement to accelerate development and testing of vaccines and anti-virals against foot-and-mouth disease in livestock. A significant part of this work involves testing combinations of vaccine, adjuvants and anti-virals in cattle.  In order to minimize variability between tests and variation coming from animals, it is important to obtain homogenous animals from reliable suppliers who are AAALAC approved. It is important that these suppliers are located close to the East coast so that stress associated to long transportation times are avoided. All previous vaccine trails have been carried out with animals from this supplier and have yielded consistent and reportable results. The proximity of the supplier to the Plum Island Animal Disease Center minimizes the shipping costs and logistics of ordering and receiving animals at this laboratory.  Most importantly, the animals from Thomas Morris are of a consistent quality in health and vitality, eliminating the common experience of receiving sick or otherwise compromised animals and having to reschedule trials after replacement animals are received.  This notice is neither a request for quotations nor a solicitation of offers.  Based on the requirements for the above system, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority FAR 6.302.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement on a full and open competitive basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No formal solicitation package is available. The Government anticipates award on April 25.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs in the preparation of responses to this announcement.

<SUBJECT>D -- Web Service Beta Test
<DESC>Description
SPECIAL NOTICE TO: Software Developers: Web Service Beta Test -- THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NO CONTRACT WILL BE ISSUED--- 

I.	Introduction:

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is pleased to announce that, in the fall of 2006, the Electronic Medical Evidence (EME) website will beta test a web service for uploading medical evidence files to SSA/Disability Determination Services (DDSs).  This is part of SSA’s ongoing effort to fully process disability claims electronically.  SSA will test the web services provided on the EME website within a distributed, service-oriented architecture.  As a result, SSA is interested in having copy service who can create an electronic image according to SSA specifications (please see below for SSA’s Image File Format Requirements, II.B) from paper medical evidence electronically, participate in this web service Beta test.  The beta test is structured to use the "consolidator" model, where the participating company serves as a conduit to gather, prepare and scan medical evidence for their customer base, e.g., medical providers, hospitals, etc.,  and create electronic images that can be electronically transmitted to SSA according to our needs.  For example, the first page of the electronic image must contain a copy of the original DDS generated coversheet which includes SSA’s 2-D barcode.  As part of the beta test, the company that participates will not be required to send paper copies of the medical evidence to the appropriate requesting DDS office, i.e., saving can be attributed by eliminating the need to print paper copies of the medical evidence and postage to return the paper copies of the DDS.

II.	TECHNICAL INFORMATION:

A.	Web Service:

The EME web service is a J2EE application which uses SOAP and WSDL specifications.  The secure offering adheres to Version 1.0 of the Web Services-Interoperability Organization (WS-I) Basic Profile.  SOAP message integrity is ensured by following Web Services Security Version 1.0 standards.  Because of this approach to standardization, Consolidator companies can program in their environment of choice (e.g., Java, Visual Studio .NET, Perl) to invoke the service and feel confident that their message payload is not compromised upon delivery to SSA.  The EME submission service will accept files in the Document Management Architecture (DMA) format as input.  Files may be attached to the message using SOAP with Attachments (SwA) or Direct Internet Message Exchange (DIME).  Throughout 2006, SSA will be finalizing this EME web service offering and allowing companies to participate in planned alpha tests in October of this year.  The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) required to invoke the service will be made available to the public in the middle of May with a developer’s guide to follow shortly thereafter. Participating companies will need to register with EME to obtain a Web Service PIN and are prepared to support the beta test period, but we are not ready to do this registration at this time.  Tentative key dates for the web service pilot are: 
•	Alpha Testing start date: 07/03/06 
•	Full Validation start date: 08/01/06 
•	Integration Testing start date: 09/10/06 
•	Beta Testing release date: 10/23/06. 

B.	Image File Format Requirements

Each TIFF file within a ZIP file should follow these specifications:
1.	One TIF file per patient with the request letter on the first page
2.	TIFF version 6
3.	Intel format (little-endian byte order)
4.	CCITT Group 4 Compression 
5.	Black & White color (Bitonal)
6.	200x200 dots per inch (DPI) resolution

TIFF files must first be packaged in specific groups of up to 64 TIFF files, and one XML file constructed to describe the group and from one to 64 TIFF files in the group.  The appropriate TIFF files and the one XML file are packaged into a single ZIP file and made available to SSA as the single ZIP file.

III.	SELECTION CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE BETA TEST OF THE WEB SERVICE: 

1.	Have the capability to scan medical evidence and create an electronic image, according to SSA’s standards, of the scanned medical evidence.
2.	Ensure SSA’s 2-D barcode coversheets is the first page within the electronic image.
3.	Ability to modify your current business process so you can start alpha testing with SSA on July 3, 2006.
4.	Guarantee SSA that 1,000 images, at a minimum, can be transmitted to SSA electronically each month of the pilot.
5.	Provide development services for your client portion of the web services and ensure that all developmental efforts will be completed by the Alpha Testing start date.

This is NOT a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  If your company is interested in discussing participation in this web service beta test, please send an email to EEDirect@ssa.gov by Monday, May 1, 2006 and you will be included in a teleconference that is planned for Wednesday, May 10, 2006 at 2 pm eastern time to discuss any questions that you may have.  In addition prior to the teleconference you will be expected to sign a participation agreement.  Reference SSA EME Web Service Beta Test 2006 in the subject field of your email and include the following information. 

1.	Contact name, mailing address, phone number and email address.
2.	Management name, mailing address, phone number and email address. 
3.	Company Website Address. 
4.	Number of images that can be transmitted to SSA on a monthly basis.
5.	Preferred method of transmission.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

General
The train regulator device shall be designed for close fixed attachment to the parachute, or to the balloon when no parachute is used, to deploy the radiosonde at a controlled descent rate to the full train length.  It shall be designed to minimize transmission of vibration to the radiosonde during deployment of the train and after full deployment.





Physical
This device shall be compact, lightweight and with no sharp edges or other features which could damage a balloon or cause personal injury.  No part or parts shall separate from the device by design or because of improper design or workmanship.

Size and Weight
The regulator in its completed form shall be lightweight and compact.  It shall weigh not more than two ounces (57 grams) and shall occupy not more than 20 cubic inches.

Material
Construction of the regulators may be of natural material, synthetic material, or any combination thereof.

Train
The regulator shall provide a train of adequate length for useful observations, with the tape, twine or string attached to the device so as not to separate during normal use.  It shall be designed to be fixed to the parachute or balloon – where no parachute is used – and shall feed its tape, twine or string from that fixed point in order to minimize interference with the signal from the radiosonde.

Length
The train regulator must carry enough tape, twine or string which at full deployment shall have a minimum length of 100 feet but not exceed 120 feet.

Strength
The tape, twine or string shall have a minimum static breaking strength of 50 pounds over a temperature range or +120 to -100 degrees Fahrenheit.

Service Life
This device shall provide satisfactory service by supporting the radiosonde instrument during the entire duration of a flight, typically ninety (90) minutes, under any combination of climatic conditions encountered throughout a flight.

Operational
The regulator when firmly attached in close proximity to the parachute or balloon shall lower a specified weight at a controlled descent rate, especially when strong surface winds prevail.

Deployment
The device shall be able to lower a weight of 2.0 pounds to the full limit of the tape, twine or string at a nominal rate of 30 feet per minute for the first 30 feet of deployment and shall be not less than 15 feet per minute, nor greater than 45 feet per minute and shall be not less than 30 feet per minute, nor greater than 60 feet per minute.  Descent must be accomplished without stripping, stalling or binding and the tape, twine, or string shall at no time spill from the device at an uncontrolled rate.

Design shall be such that a minimum of vibration is transmitted to the radiosonde during deployment.  An integral or add-on shock absorber device may be included in order to prevent, or at least minimize, transmission of vibration.

Environment
The device shall comply fully with the requirements of this specification at all temperatures in the range (+120 to -100 degrees Fahrenheit).  It shall operate satisfactorily when any condition or combinations of severe surface weather conditions prevail.  These shall include, but not be limited to, rain, freezing rain, snow, sleet, and winds of up to 60 miles per hour at launch.

Quality Assurance and Inspection

Bid Sample Inspection and Tests
All  bidder’s  shall supply a minimum of three (3) each bid samples which shall conform to all the requirements specified herein and shall be representative of the type of quality of regulators which he proposes to furnish as a production item.  Bid samples need not be provided if bidder has successfully produced this product for NWS before.  The bid samples supplied with quote will not be considered as any part of quantity ordered.  Samples will be depleted during the preaward testing process, therefore bid samples will not be returned.  Samples should be sent to:  National Weather Service SRDC, ATTN: James Fitzgibbon, 43741 Weather Service Road, Sterling, VA 20166-9603.   

Production Inspection and Tests
Inspection and tests of production regulators for compliance with the requirements of this specification will be performed by the Government on a sampling basis to determine compliance with the requirements herein.  Because of the limitations of physical sampling tests, the Government will augment this information with field performance data conducted in an operational environment to verify compliance with specification requirements.

Shelf Life
The regulators shall not deteriorate in quality and shall be able to meet the requirements specified herein for a period of 24 months from the date of acceptance, when stored in the original package at temperatures ranging between +120 through -40 degrees Fahrenheit.  Inspection and tests specified in Bid Sample Inspection and Tests, and Production Inspection and Tests will be used to demonstrate compliance.

Preparation and Delivery

Packaging
All packaging shall be in accordance with currently recognized industry standards of good practice.

Individual
Each train regulator shall be individually packaged in any material which will exclude foreign materials, prevent entanglement of the individual units and which will not open accidentally under conditions of storage and normal handling.



Bulk
The individually packaged units shall further be packaged in cartons, each containing fifty (50) individual units.  In addition to being of sufficient size to contain fifty units, the carton size shall be chosen such that multiple cartons, typically eight to twelve, will conveniently fit into a shipping container.

Shipping
The container for shipment shall be chosen which is of such a size to accommodate multiple cartons conveniently and without an excess of dead space.

Alternatives
Other modes of packaging may be proposed by the contractor.  Such an alternative can only be adopted subject to the written approval of the Government Contracting Officer.

Instructions and Marking
Operational instructions for proper use of the regulators and marking of cartons and containers shall be in accordance with the following:

Instructions – Each carton containing 50 individual units shall also contain a sheet with simple and concise instructions for proper use of the regulator.  A diagram may be used and is advised in addition to the written instructions.

                    WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

 1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
 be:

 *  an existing published wage determination
 *  a survey underlying a wage determination
 *  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
    a wage determination matter
 *  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

 On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
 for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
 Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
 because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
 Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
 contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
 and 3.) should be followed.

 With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
 process described here, initial contact should be with the
 Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

        Branch of Construction Wage Determinations

        Wage and Hour Division

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
 interested party (those affected by the action) can request
 review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
 (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

        Wage and Hour Administrator

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
 interested party's position and by any information (wage
 payment data, project description, area practice material,
 etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

 3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
 interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
 Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

        Administrative Review Board

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
Plastic Blasting Media
Malmstrom AFB, MT


The contractor must provide a supply of Plastic Blasting Media (PBM), brand name “Quick Strip "G" or Equal” and glass beads for abrasive blasting operations in the 341 MMXS Corrosion Shop.  Operations will be conducted in a new facility.  A new blasting booth will be installed and initial system operation is scheduled for 15 May 2006.  Once removal operations begin, used media will contain heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and chromates.  It will be considered a hazardous waste unless properly recycled.  Used blasting media must be reclaimed and recycled to prevent the creation of a hazardous waste stream.  The contractor must ensure spent media is recycled in manner that complies with all state and federal laws and requirements.
	a.  Product specifications require media of Medium 20/40 mesh in 300# drums or equivalent.  Also, glass beads will be pruchased under the terms of this agreement.  An initial purchase of 2,000 pounds of Plastic Media will be required to charge the PBM system with an open purchase agreement to purchase additional supplies as required.
	b.  An initial purchase of 200 pounds of glass beads will be required to charge the sand blasting cabinet with an open purchase agreement to purchase additional supplies as required.

SCOPE:  The Statement of Work (SOW) covers the requirements for a contract to purchase blasting media to Malmstrom AFB for use in de-painting and removing corrosion.  The Contractors shall remove the spent blast media (SBM) from Malmstrom AFB and recycle it in a manner that will prevent it from being considered a solid waste or hazardous waste.  This contract shall provide for media delivery, SBM pick up, transportation and recycling by the contractor as specified herein. 
 
The Contractors shall provide the labor, required equipment, transportation, necessary plant facilities for recycling, ensure regulatory permitting, and obtain all regulatory agency approvals as necessary to legally fulfill the requirements of this SOW.  


SPENT BLAST MEDIA HANDLING REQUIREMENTS:

The Contractor shall provide containers for the collection of the SBM at the generation points on Malmstrom AFB.  

The SBM shall be collected in the containers provided by the contractor, labeled by the government, and held by the government for pick up by the contractor.  The government will ensure that the SBM is acceptable for pick up.  All inspection data by government or contractor will remain on file with the government for a minimum of two years.

When the contractor is notified that a load of SBM is ready for pickup it must be removed within 30 calendar days.  The Contractors shall notify the government at least 48 hours ahead of the truck arrival date.

The Contractors shall arrange and pay for transportation from Malmstrom AFB to the contractor facility where recycling occurs.  The contractor is solely responsible for the SBM while in transit.  If an accident or spill of the SBM occurs while in transit, the contractor is solely responsible for cleanup and for any notifications required by federal, state or local regulations.

All transporting, storing, handling, manufacturing processes, and recycling of the SBM shall be performed within the continental United States.

Contractor shall use the SBM in a recycling process that satisfies the USEPA regulations such that the SBM is not a solid waste and therefore is not a hazardous waste.  The federal regulatory requirements, which must be satisfied by the Contractor, follows:

The Contractor shall accept the premise that the SBM is a “spent material” in accordance with 40CFR 261.1(c)(1).  “A spent material is any material that has been used and as a result of contamination can no longer serve the purpose for which it was produced, without processing.”

A “spent material” is not a solid waste when it can be shown to be recycled by one of the following three methods.  (40CFR 261.2(e)(1))

(i)  “Used or reused as ingredients in an industrial process to make a product, provided the materials are not being reclaimed; or

 (ii) Used or reused as effective substitutes for commercial products; or

(iii) Returned to the original process from which they are generated, without first being reclaimed or land disposed...”

The Contractor shall specify which of these three methods is used to recycle the SBM and explain in writing how the process satisfies the method.

The Contractor shall provide detailed documentation for the recycling process including facility location and layout, product formulation, process flow chart with all equipment shown, production rates, and other pertinent details.

If method (ii) is used, the contractor shall provide documentation showing how much SBM is used in the formulation and what ingredients it is a substitute for shall be provided.   Proof that it is an “effective substitute” shall be provided, such that the “toxics along for the ride (TAR)” concern, as addressed by EPA, is satisfied. This documentation must be provided to the government.

The products of the recycling process shall be completely described and documented.  They shall meet the criteria at 40CFR 261.2(e)(2) as follows.

(i) Recycled products shall not be “Applied to the Land”.  Specifically, “applied to the land” to mean without limitation such items as fence posts, blocks or concrete block like products or other items that are used underground and/or that are used in contact with the earth.  The contractor shall accept this interpretation and shall not propose or use recycling processes that produce such items.

(ii) The recycling process shall not involve “Materials burned for energy recovery, used to produce a fuel, or contained in fuels; or

(iii) “Materials accumulated speculatively”, the definition of which is given at 40CFR 261.1(c)(7)).  The SBM, prior to recycle, shall not be accumulated speculatively.  The Contractor shall provide documentation and data that demonstrates compliance with this requirement for each month that the recycle process has been used. 


The Contractor shall provide the documentation described in 40CFR 261.2(f) demonstrating that there is a known market for the recyclable material and demonstrating that the recycling of the material meets the requirements for exclusion or exemption contained in 40CFR 261.  

The Contractor shall recognize and understand that in addition to the USEPA regulations cited herein, the states involved may have regulations that are more stringent or broader in scope.  In that case the contractor shall identify those requirements and comply with the state regulations.  This applies as a minimum for the state of Montana and for the state or states where the recycling is done.

The Contractors shall ensure all containers are properly labeled, sealed, and in good condition for shipping prior to shipping of SBM containers.  The Contractors shall be responsible for the completion of appropriate information on all labels.  The Contractors shall replace any damaged containers before transport.  The contractor shall provide the government with net weights of each container of SBM transported off Malmstrom AFB.

The Contractor shall provide the Government with complete tracking and handling records of each container of SBM. This will include data from the point of pick up through proper recycling of the SBM.    This record shall be submitted in updated form each calendar month to the contract administrator and to the Hazardous Waste Program Manager at Malmstrom AFB.

If SBM that is initially designated as recyclable by the government and is later designated and properly disposed of by the Contractor as hazardous waste, the contractor shall provide copies of manifests to the contract administrator and the Hazardous Waste Program Manager.   The Contractor shall ensure and certify that all actions taken in this regard adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and permits.

<DESC>1.  This is an amendment to answer questions concerning the combined synopsis/solicitation W911QX-06-T-0055. QUESTION:  It is understood that the Government wants the furnace to run in Argon. Is the Argon flowing through the system at temperature, steady state, or partial pressure? ANSWER:  The Government wants the furnace to run under a partial pressure of Argon or under an active vacuum.  The Government is not planning to flow Argon at temperature.  The partial pressure of Ar would be no greater than 10 Torr. QUESTION:  Do the Government need a paper chart recorder, or is the controller data acquisition sufficient? This is a visual version of the chart recorder, which can be stored or printed. ANSWER:  The Government does not need a paper chart recorder.  The Controller data acquisition will be sufficient. QUESTION:  Does the Government want the clean dry ambient chamber to read 10-6 Torr and then when heated to 1200C maintain 10-5 Torr? ANSWER:  Yes, that would be the minimum level of performance required. QUESTION:  How far is the 480V, 3PH, 60Hz, 175KV located from the furnace installation location? How far are the water, air and gas input lines? ANSWER:  The power, water, air and gas input lines are located from 2 to 15 feet from the installation location.
