This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers.

(b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number.

Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to procure, on a sole source basis from L-3 Communications Corporation, 7500 Meahr Road, Waco Texas, the modification of the Radio Frequency Switching and Distribution Unit, (RFSDU), to correct excessive noise on the RF outputs. The RFSDU was developed by Raytheon during the E-6 Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) effort. Raytheon has since transferred the proprietary data for the RFSDU to L-3, who now serves as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and provides depot repair support for this component. The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with L-3 Communications Corporation on an other than full and open competitive basis to accomplish this effort. The authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency Requirements," as L-3 is the only source possessing the proprietary data rights needed for the modification of the RFSDU. A Solicitation Document is not available at this time. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Please go to http://www.l-3com.com/ for possible subcontracting opportunities.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to award a modification to Delivery Order 0001 under the Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N61340-12-G-0001 to L-3 Communications Corporation, Link Simulation &amp; Training Division (L-3) Company for the relocation of Tactical Operational Flight Trainers (TOFTs) 15 and 35 (including the associated Instructor Operator Systems (IOS) and Image Generator (IG) systems) and a Brief Debrief System-2 (BDS-2). TOFT 35 will be moved from NAS Lemooreto MCAS Miramar, installed, upgraded to include Information Assurance (IA) software, and integrated to the existing TOFT system. TOFT 15 and BDS-2 will be moved from NAS Lemoore to L-3 Communications in Grand Prairie, TX. BDS-2 will be upgraded to a BDS/Mission Operation Center (MOC), installed and integrated into the existing network to include IA requirements. At the same time as move, during installation new Image Generator (IG) systems will be installed and integrated on both TOFTs that were purchased via separate contracting efforts.<br /><br />As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the F/A-18C/D TOFT and BDS and as the only company to deliver current US Navy F/A-18C/D TOFTs, L-3 is the only source capable of upgrading the existing systems and delivering TOFTs. Award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling F/A-18C/D mission training requirements. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).

This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a firm fixed price (FFP) contract with the Canadian Commercial Corporation worked to be performed by Honeywell Ottawa (EMS SATCOM), 400 Maple Grove Road, Ottawa, Canada, K2V 1B8316.
  The contract will be a one-time procurement of P-3 Radome for AMT-50, P/N: 0811-F-0111-02. This requirement will be negotiated on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the lack of detailed drawings/specifications in addition to duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the systems.

Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to submit offers to the Point of Contact (POC) at NSWC Crane.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT<br />DATED: OCTOBER 26, 2012</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />In preparation to meet the training requirements for the new USCG Fast Response Cutter (FRC), the United States Coast Guard (USCG) desires to purchase cut-away training aids for the MTU 20V4000M93L engine. The training aids will enable instructors to demonstrate operation, maintenance, and repair procedures. These training aids will be used in the training program that directly supports maintenance and operations of the Main Diesel Engines (MDEs) installed aboard Coast Guard WPC/FRC class of cutters. The cut-away training aids shall be delivered to USCG Training Center (TRACEN) Yorktown, VA.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is a military, multi-mission, maritime service within the Department of Homeland Security and one of the nation's five armed services. Its core roles are to protect the public, the environment, and U.S. economic and security interests in any maritime region in which those interests may be at risk, including international waters and America's coasts, ports, and inland waterways.</p>
<p>The USCG has made a conscious effort within the last few years to determine the most appropriate, cost effective solutions to workforce performance problems, while simultaneously optimizing the current training infrastructure to meet operational and logistical demands. The USCG currently relies heavily on contracted training for the maintenance, operation, and troubleshooting of Tognum America propulsion machinery and electronic controls on the WPC class cutter. The USCG training program management office (FC-Tms) has worked to garner the resources necessary to lessen the reliance on contracted training. The USCG has determined that TRACEN Yorktown's Engineering and Weapons (T-ew) facility will be the future site to train operators and maintainers of this equipment. A significant T-ew facilities renovation is currently underway and will include the construction of a new building intended to house the WPC/FRC training aids, laboratories, and classrooms to create the USCG Training Center Yorktown, Engineering Systems School. The cut-away training aids procured by this task order shall be stored at the USCG Training Center Yorktown, Engineering Systems School.</p>
<p>1.3 SECURITY. <br />Contractor access to classified information is not currently required under this task order.</p>
<p>1.4 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. <br />The period of performance for this Purchase Order will be 6 months ARO.</p>

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice and NOT a Request For Proposal (RFP) Solicitation. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) Long Range Surveillance Product Line, Elizabeth City, NC 27909 intends to solicit Proposals for the Repair of various Liquid Indicators that are used on the USCG HC-130H Aircraft. The Government anticipates award of a single Requirements Contract but may break out CLINs and award more than one contract if determined to be in the best interest of the Government. The Solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) using the policies of FAR 12 in conjunction with FAR 15, and will be issued as a Total Small Business Set-aside. The Small Business Administration (SBA) establishes small business size standards on an -industry-by-industry basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 336413 and the size standard established by the SBA for this industry is 1000 employees. To be eligible for award as a small business, an offeror must represent in good faith that it is a small business at the time of its written representation for the NAICS 336413 industry.

<DESC>W912DS-13-S-0003--<br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY TO CONDUCT MARKET RESEARCH FOR DEVELOPING A PROCUREMENT STRATEGY FOR AN UPCOMING CONTRACT FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL AND HAUL SERVICE. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. A SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE.
<p>Interest in this announcement is to determine the availability and capability of Businesses located in the immediate FEMA determined disaster area. The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potentially qualified Large Businesses, Small Businesses (SB), 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman Owned Business (WO), Economically Disadvantaged Woman Owned Small Business (EDWOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or HUBZone prime contractor business sources and their size classifications relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for Debris Removal and Haul and is procured in accordance with the Stafford Act as implemented in Subpart 26 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK: Perform overall site management work at a Temporary Storage Site (TSS) for eligible Hurricane Sandy generated debris that has been temporarily collected and stockpiled at Jacob Riis Park located in Queens, NY.

All work shall be performed in accordance with federal, state and local requirements. The contractor will be responsible for providing sufficient site management engineering controls. Applicable worker protection requirements and standards shall apply.</p>
<p>USACE New York District is seeking Capability Statements from all qualified and interested Small Business Firms located in, or primarily doing business in the counties of Richmond, Queens, Kings, Bronx and New York, New York. The NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 562119, Other Waste Collection, and the small business size standard is $12.5 million. The Federal Supply Code is P999, Other Salvaging Services. Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 50% of the contract work with their own employees. For the purposes of this procurement, a firm is considered a small business if its annual average gross revenue, taken for the last three (3) fiscal years, does not exceed $12.5 Million. Large business firms will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan specific to the subcontracted work (compliant with FAR 52.219-9). If the selected firm intends to submit a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale in the plan why the above goals cannot be met. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>The Government will use responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis for the purpose of planning to make appropriate acquisition decisions to solicit a procurement 100% set-aside for Small Business firms located, or primarily doing business, in the counties of Richmond, Queens, Kings, Bronx and New York, New York. All interested parties that meet the requirements are invited to submit, in writing, complete information describing their interest and ability to meet all requirements stated above. Proposals will be evaluated using a Best Value source selection process that will result in award of a firm fixed-price to the responsive, responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, offers the Best Value to the Government, technical, past performance, and price considered. The Government anticipates completion of contract performance by April 1, 2013. The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements as indicated in the Statement of Work to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and past performance references. Respondents must include references and a capabilities statement for at least two completed or current projects, for which your firm was the prime contractor (or major contractor) within the last three years of work similar in size, scope, and complexity. Each reference shall include contact names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, contract numbers as well as a description of the services provided, contract type (i.e. fixed priced or cost), and dollar value. <br /><br />Contractors must be registered in Systems for Award Management (SAM) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at the time of contract Award. Please see www.sam.gov for additional registration information.</p>
<p>If contractors need assistance in registering, contractors can contact the local Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTAC) in their area. The Technical Assistance Center can help with Procurement and registration process.<br />http://www.dla.mil/SmallBusiness/Pages/ProcurementTechnicalAssistanceCenters.aspx#top</p>
<p>The capabilities statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing or developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified in the Statement of Work. Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities Statement. Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participations will assist USACE in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities. All qualified businesses are strongly encouraged to submit a capabilities statement. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among local Small Business Firms. Submissions that do not meet all requirements or submitted within the allotted time will not be considered. Electronic submissions via email will be accepted, facsimile submissions will not. Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis shall be emailed to Bjorn Hale at Bjorn.T.Hale@usace.army.mil. Responses must be received no later than January 4, 2013, at 4:00pm.</p>

<a href="mailto:jennifer.chrissis@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Baltimore</a>
<DESC>The United States Corps of Engineers (USACE), Baltimore District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (greater than $25M) within the Baltimore-Washington corridor.  Projects may consist of new construction as well as renovation, repairs and upgrade projects.   <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).   <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy states: Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.  Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law.  Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, Clause: FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs.  Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> (1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts awarded by the Baltimore District Corps of Engineers in the Baltimore-Washington Corridor?   <br>  <br> (2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? <br>  <br> (3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> (4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses? <br>  <br> (5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA? <br>  <br> (6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA? <br>  <br> (7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Baltimore District solicitation and any resultant contract? <br>  <br> Responses shall be submitted via email to Jennifer Chrissis at Jennifer.Chrissis@usace.army.mil no later than 3 p.m. (EST) on 14 January 2013.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey. <br>

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE SOLICITATION FOR TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL STAFFING SERVICES (TAPS): The National Administrative and Office Supplies Acquisition Center, New York, NY, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective 12/31/2012 electronically only. Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-N6-030736-B (include the dashes). 

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to six (6) months before your offer is evaluated. 

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) website. The SAM website can be accessed at https://www.sam.gov.
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by another refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous and will contain contracts with periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusive of any options) from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to any option to extend the term of the contract, or cancelled sooner. This solicitation contains an option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with a $2,500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding Fee provisions. 

This is 100% set aside for Small Businesses. We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.

Any paper offer received will be rejected as non-responsive. Paper copies of rejected offers will not be returned to the offeror. Schedule 736 is a mandatory eOffer schedule.  Submit eOffers at: http://eoffer.gsa.gov.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

The renewal of the maintenance for the existing LAN Desk suites will allow NIST to continue to function without interruption.<br /><br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because this is renewal for items that were already purchased previously.</p>

POC: CPT Voll/MAJ Moon steven.moon1@us.army.mil or 760-380-4472 <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>

Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a low-energy, low-angle argon ion mill.
<p><br />The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a low-energy, low-angle argon ion mill. This instrument will be used for final thinning of transmission electron microscopy specimens and for removal of the amorphous damage layer on FIB-prepared TEM specimens. An ion mill that can focus the ion beam down to a size of 5 &micro;m or less is required to remove this amorphous damage layer without sputtering the support substrate material onto the TEM lamella. The mill must be capable of holding both 3-mm TEM specimen support grids and Omniprobe half grids. To minimized damage to the specimen during milling, a variable ion beam energy of 50 eV to 2 keV and specimen cooling capabilities are required. For cleanliness of the samples in the TEM, the argon ion mill must have an oil-free vacuum system. Since the ion mill will be installed in a multi-user facility, ease of use and quick sample exchange and cooling/warming times are necessary.</p>
<p>The required low-energy, low-angle argon ion mill meets the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Argon gas source, with a purity of 99.999%</p>
<p>2. Capable of holding both 3-mm TEM specimen support grids and Omniprobe half grids</p>
<p>3. Variable beam energy continuously adjustable from 50eV or less, up to a maximum of 2 keV</p>
<p>4. Ion beam size at the specimen of 5 &micro;m or less throughout the entire operating voltage range</p>
<p>4. Variable milling angles of +/- 10 degrees</p>
<p>5. Oil-free vacuum system</p>
<p>6. Capable of liquid nitrogen cooling during milling</p>
<p>7. Specimen exchange times under 3 minutes for room temperature milling and under 20 minutes for liquid nitrogen cooling during milling</p>
<p>8. Redeposition of the milled material on the area of interest must be minimized</p>
<p>9. Secondary electron based imaging for precise placement of the ion beam on the specimen</p>
<p>10. Computer controlled, with the ability to monitor the milling process and to store milling recipes</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the low-energy, low-angle argon ion mill, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that results would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies capable of providing a low-energy, low-angle argon ion mill are requested to email a detailed report describing their capabilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:<br /><br />1. Name of the company that provides the equipment for which specifications are provided.<br /><br />2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to provide the equipment, their address(es), and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).<br /><br />3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such equipment.<br /><br />4. Indication of whether the equipment for which specifications are provided is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).<br /><br />5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

THOSE ENTITIES WHO HAVE ALREADY REGISTERED WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THIS CHANGE BY EMAIL. **<br /><br /><br />The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for U.S. Mission Germany. The U.S. Mission Germany requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement. The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.</p>
<p>Due to the large dollar value and complexity of the U.S. Mission Germany Local Guard Program, the Department of State has determined the need to conduct a pre-solicitation conference before releasing the solicitation for this requirement. This conference will be used to highlight key areas of the solicitation, discuss issues that may affect prospective offerors ability to manage this contract, and show prospective slides of the place of performance (i.e., specific guard posts) of locations covered by this requirement in lieu of an actual "site visit" to each respective location. ATTENDANCE AT THIS PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE IS MANDATORY for any offeror who wants to submit a proposal for this requirement. This conference will be held at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, Germany at <strong>1:00 PM</strong> local on November 15, 2012.</p>
<p>Offerors interested in attending must preregister by contacting Amanda Rogers, rogersan@state.gov no later than 4:00 pm EDT, November 13, 2012. No more than three (3) representatives from each interested offeroring firm (to include potential joint venture partners) may attend the pre-proposal conference. Interested offerors shall provide the name (s) of the representative (s) who will attend the conference, name of the representing firm, address of the firm, telephone number of each person attending and DUNS number of the firm that will be the primary contractor. Each attendee of the conference SHALL PRESENT TWO FORMS OF PICTURE IDENTIFICATION confirming identity. Those representatives unable to present two forms of identification SHALL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. Preregistration is MANDATORY. Interested offerors are solely responsible for ALL expenses resulting from this announcement (i.e. travel, lodging, per diem, proposal costs and other miscellaneous expenses, etc.) and are responsible for confirming all dates specified in this announcement by immediately checking the solicitation when posted on www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov to see if there are any changes.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates posting the U.S. Mission Germany solicitation on this site approximately&nbsp;<strong>sixty (60)&nbsp;</strong>days after the pre-solicitation conference. No paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately&nbsp;<strong>forty-five (45)</strong> days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and any change will be posted on this site.</p>
<p>Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Amanda N. Rogers at rogersan@state.gov PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the best technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<DONBR>HSTS01-13-F-HRM002 
<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Office of Human Capital (OHC), Organizational Assessment Services (OAS), and the Office of Acquisition awarded a hybrid firm fixed price/ time and materials delivery order to Personnel Decisions Research Institutes, Inc. (PDRI) on December 18, 2012. This award is a logical follow-on, to allow time to appropriately transition the Employee Assessment Management System (EAMS) functionalities from PDRI's solution to the DHS Enterprise solution. The current expiration date for the Period of Performance is December 24, 2012. The extension period will consist of one 12-month base period and four 6-month option periods. This action is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(b)(2) Logical Follow-On.
<p>The Department of Homeland Security is currently soliciting vendors to support an agency-wide Enterprise Talent Management System (ETM), which is anticipated to become mandatory for all components to use for learning and performance management functionality. Additionally, this system will provide test management functionality equivalent to what is currently provided to TSA by EAMS. This contract is anticipated to be awarded and ready for TSA to begin work in the fall of 2013. At that time, OHC will be able to begin transitioning functionality to the new system. Thus, the OHC is requesting a 1-year extension with four 6-month options to the current contract to allow for one year to complete the acquisition process, and if needed two additional years to fully transition to the new system. In the event the transition occurs ahead of schedule, the option periods will not be utilized.</p>
