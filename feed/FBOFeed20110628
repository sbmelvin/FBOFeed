<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yakima Field Office, Yakima WA, intends to soliciate a sole source procurement for a brand name relay tester, Omicron CMC 356 with the following characteristics:CMC 356 Test Unit with Advanced Protection SoftwareCMControl front panel control 				Option ELT-1 for new CMC 356 				Generator combination cable 					Heavy-duty transport case 					Enoserv RTS License with OMICRON driver 			This requirement will be issued under RFQ R11PS1C330 on or before June 30, 2011. This acquisition is a total small business set a-side under NAICS code 334515 with a size standard of 500 employees.
 This action is applicable to FAR Part 6.302-1(2)(b)(4) as stated:4) When the agency head has determined in accordance with the agency's standardization program that only specified makes and models of technical equipment and parts will satisfy the agency's needs for additional units or replacement items, and only one source is available. (c) Application for brand name descriptions. An acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited. It shall be justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304. The justification should indicate that the use of such descriptions in the acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. See 5.102(a)(6) for the requirement to post the brand name justification. (Brand-name or equal descriptions, and other purchase descriptions that permit prospective contractors to offer products other than those specifically referenced by brand name, provide for full and open competition and do not require justifications and approvals to support their use.)  All required justificatrions have been completed and includes the following narrative:

Reclamation issued and re-issued a solicitation through open competition to procure a relay test set.  Of the bids received in both solicitations, none of the bids met the original requirements.  In order to procure this equipment with the urgency that is required and to acquire the only suitable relay test set available, the equipment will be sole sourced.  The submittals have provided additional market research that the Omicron test equipment is the only equipment that meets the technical requirements identified by the agency, and that it is a good value for the agency.  Reclamation-wide test routines and technical support for the Omicron equipment are available, and is one of the most essential needs.  This is the only test set which works with Enoserv RTS, has the required interface, has the required input/output capabilities, and meets the voltage-current generation characteristics. Based on market research, the Omicron test equipment is the only test set that meets the technical requirements in order for the Yakima Project to perform testing on its critical equipment.
The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the required test listed above that will satisfy the Agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer. Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses received by close of business July 5, 2011, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Goverment not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Goverment. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attn.Connie Morgan, or by electronic mail at cmorgan@usbr.gov.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury Office of Technical Assistance is recruiting individuals on a competitive basis to serve as resident and/or intermittent (short-term) advisors, under personal services contracts, for its Banking and Financial Services Program.  This recruitment is for global assignments and significant international travel is required.  

The Banking and Financial Services Program is charged with promoting commercial banking sector development that efficiently intermediates between savers and investors.  To achieve this, the program works with central banks, ministries of finance, banking regulatory and supervision agencies, deposit insurance agencies, banking associations, and other banking related entities in countries with emerging or transition economies.  It also provides technical assistance to countries that have developed economies but are experiencing difficulties in their banking sectors.

QUALIFICATIONS: Treasury is seeking candidates who possess expertise in banking and bank regulation with specific experience in the restructuring and privatization of banks; banking sector development, asset management and disposition; payment systems; banking supervision (on-site and off-site); deposit guaranty systems; central bank operations; monetary policy; credit analysis; lending; bank liquidations; and other facets of banking sector activity.  In addition, advisors skilled in the regulation and supervision of insurance sectors are also sought.  A working knowledge of French, Spanish, or Arabic will be a plus in relevant countries.  Ideal candidates would have experience with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve, Resolution Trust Corporation, international financial institutions, and/or commercial banks.  Prior overseas experience working in challenging environments would be a distinct advantage but is not mandatory.  While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of officials in host countries is also very important.
 
Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.

SALARY AND BENEFITS: Salaries will be negotiated in accordance with program regulations based on demonstrated salary history. Expected compensation currently ranges from $123,758 to $165,300. Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations.  Successful applicants must be able to obtain medical and security clearances.  This announcement is open and continuous until December 30, 2011, although selections maybe made in advance of that date.  To apply, please send cover letter, resume or OF-612 by e-mail to: recruitment@ota.treas.gov or by mail to: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Office of Technical Assistance, Attn: Recruitment Coordinator, 740 15th Street, N.W.  4th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20220.

Please reference Solicitation Number A11-091 on your resume or OF-612.  Only applicants to be interviewed will be contacted.  No Phone calls please and no hand carries.  If you wish to be considered for this announcement and all future announcements for the Financial Institutions Policy and Regulation Program, you must state so in the cover letter to your application.

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support Activity, within the Department of Defense, is hereby generating the DRAFT solicitation to the Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) Japan Tailored Logistics Support Program. The purpose of this initiative is to establish the third generation program for the Japan Region for logistics support of military installations, federal agencies, and other authorized customers within the geographic area. It is anticipated to continue the Tailored Logistics Support Program under an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for MRO materials. The contract term of this action is a two year base to include a 60 day "ramp-up" (if necessary) with two eighteen month unilateral option periods. Offer on the option portion is mandatory. A minimum of two and a maximum of four contracts are anticipated to the lowest price technically acceptable utilizing LPTA Source Selection procedures. All resulting orders will be competed with those awardees.
<p>Attachment ONE contains a "Core list" of frequently used items in the region and is as a representative sample of the items to be included in the basic solicitation. There may be minor modifications to the core list prior to issuing the final solicitation. For the final solicitation, initial pricing for the 500 core list items will serve as the ceiling price for the first six months of the base period. Items subject to more pricing volatility will be so identified and have the pricing fixed as a ceiling price for the first three months of the base period. Offerors will also have to submit pricing for the 500 core list items for each option period. Subsequently, pricing for the 500 core list items will serve as the ceiling price for the first six months of each option period, and items identified as subject to more pricing volatility will have the pricing fixed as a ceiling price for the first three months of each option period. At this time, DLA Troop Support MRO welcomes your comments to the draft solicitation. Written comments shall be received (via e-mail) and addressed to: meghan.michalski@dla.mil on or before July 12, 2011 and may be considered for inclusion in the final solicitation. DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL as NO evaluations will be conducted at this time. The government will not issue direct responses to vendor comments or questions. If submitting comments, make reference to the specific page and text of this draft RFP. Due to the anticipated level of interest, DLA Troop Support will not entertain individual requests for contractor visits or marketing calls.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Bioptigen Corporation for the purchase of a Bioptigen Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography System under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />The equipment will be used in NIST laboratory to produce high-quality image data of 3D cell culture grown to mimic biological tissues and standard reference materials developed by the NIST OMI team. This equipment will also be used as a validation tool of other optical coherence tomography imagery outside of NIST through comparative study performed on the same reference material, whose image results are obtained by other OCT imager(s) outside NIST to be compared with the results obtained by the higher-resolution equipment in NIST. <br />Boiptegen specifically can meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. The capability of &lt;1 micrometer depth resolution in order to characterize reference samples (optical phantoms) with included features smaller than the current best resolution (about 3 um) of common OCT systems currently in use. <br />2. Precision design and alignment of optics to enable the wavenumber-linearized spectral detection with &lt;5% inter-pixel linearization error in order to enable precise correlation between image pixels and sample coordinates with &lt;5% error.<br />3. Fast imaging capability of 18,000 cross sectional scans per second with 4096 pixels per line and dipper imaging analysis in order to resolve fast dynamics of cells moving in the tissue.</p>
<p>Bioptigen is the only vendor that offers a spectral domain optical coherent tomography system that is commercially available that meets all of NIST's requirements. No other vendor can provide a system that meets NIST's requirements.</p>
<p><br />Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern) on July 12, 2011. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Christopher.ganey@nist.gov.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Retsch, Inc. in Newton, PA for the purchase of a benchtop cryomill with a recirculating system.***
<p>***Retsch Inc. is the only manufacturer that offers a benchtop cryomill with a recirculating liquid nitrogen system. This unique feature offers additional safety to the user by minimizing the amount of liquid nitrogen which must be handled, since the liquid nitrogen recirculates in a closed system. In addition, the following unique features are also required by NIST:</p>
<p>1) Liquid nitrogen does not contact the samples (reduces contamination); <br />2) Automatic cooling system integrated with the sample timing scheme;<br />3) Stainless steel, autoclavable components in contact with the sample (sterile and clean environment);<br />4) Variable grinding frequency up to 25 Hz;<br />5) Continuous feed of liquid nitrogen;<br />6) Double-locking mechanism so that cells stay closed, reducing accidental loss of samples;<br />7) Programmable settings allow for great flexibility in the pre-cool and grinding cycles.</p>
<p>Retsch Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of these systems.<br /><br />***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Charleston, SC, and is required within 45 days after receipt of order.***</p>
<p>***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.***</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) intends to solicit on a sole source basis with the Hugo W. Moser Research Institute at Kennedy Krieger, Inc., 707 North Broadway, Baltimore, Maryland, for the continuation of the federation of the Interactive Autism Network (IAN) with the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR.) The Interactive Autism Network (IAN) is an on-line forum for individuals and family members affected by autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The site solicits, via questionnaires, input on a variety of factors including diagnosis, development, family history and treatments as well as two standardized assessments of ASD symptomatology. IAN has collected self-reported data on nearly 40,000 consented participants. IAN is building and maintaining a data warehouse and developing means to federate this data with the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR), allowing ASD investigators direct access to these subjects for data analysis, recruitment for studies, and to augment data collection in support of existing NIH projects. Additional support is requested to continue the ongoing efforts to federate IAN data with NDAR and specifically to develop the technical means to use the itrust/incommons eraCommons authentication scheme that is shared by NDAR, dbGaP, and other autism federated databases. Additionally, IAN will develop and promote to NIH researchers the steps needed to have their research participants enroll in IAN. This will provide benefit to NIH researchers allowing the IAN data to be linked with the clinically captured research data within NDAR. The IAN database currently resides and is maintained by the Kennedy Krieger Institute, Inc. The period of performance is 24 months with the option of up to 2 one-year option period(s.)<br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure a membership from Metropolitan Research and Education Network (MREN) on a sole source basis.
<p>Membership in the Chicago, Illinois area Metropolitan Research and Education Network (MREN) consortium is required in order for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to communicate and exchange data with domestic and international biomedical researchers via advanced communication systems. This membership will need to continue as long as necessary into the foreseeable future so that the NLM can continue to communicate with its users and research partners (currently via dedicated high-speed communications circuits established from the NIH Consolidated Collocation Site (NCCS). Many NLM users domestically and internationally access its resources via high-performance connections at their respective institutions which in turn connect with their regional aggregation points which in turn connect to their national research and education networks all of which enables continued collaboration and advances in biomedical research and development. This worldwide network of advanced research and education networks and their peering arrangements is the structure by which this happens. The MREN operates, in the Chicago, Illinois area the regional aggregation point for traffic to/from many domestic and international destinations (see www.mren.org for details).</p>
<p>NLM plans to continue to make use of the Next Generation Internet/Internet2 services available through the Metropolitan Research and Education Network (MREN) organization for continued redundant access to the domestic and international R&amp;D advanced networking community. Membership in this consortium provides access to these services and is necessary for continued advanced Internet traffic exchange. Previously this link was used as a back-up link but is now to be used for increasingly higher volumes of traffic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Metropolitan Research and Education Network (MREN) organization is the only known provider of advanced high-performance connectivity services in the Chicago area to both the domestic and international research and development community and as such is uniquely qualified for this work because of their background, expertise, and peering arrangements with regional, domestic and international research and education institutions, networks and projects. Additionally delays of up to six months would be necessary to move the existing telecommunications link (NCCS?MREN) connecting to the MREN facilities to a new location and this would interrupt the existing heavily used Internet2 communications link used by the NLM operating now between the NCCS and the MREN.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisitions of Non- Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR): http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html. The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site: FAR 52.213-4, Terms and Conditions?Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Items) (December 2007). However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government. Proposals must include pricing information. Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice. EMAIL OR FAXED PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Geological Survey, (USGS) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with the University of Alabama, Department of Geography, Placenames Research Center, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled, Acquisition of Commercial Items. Purchase of services to update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database for the entire state of Hawaii is planned.  For over 26 years the University of Alabama has classified GNIS data on a national basis.  Over time the University has acquired an extensive and unique map reference library of source materials directly related to updating GNIS data.  It is a unique resource for researching various sources to discern what type of feature a Hawaiian geographic name refers to because of the use of native generics.  The University will use research material they already have in house to perform these data collections.
Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish this or compatible GNIS database services may submit a capabilities statement to the Contract Specialist no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  As required by FAR 5.101(a)(1), the forthcoming Request for Quote (G11PS00592) will be made available through the GPE on or about 06/28/2011, whether or not competitive opportunities have been identified.  All responses must be in writing by hard copy to the Contract Specialist by email to vfriesner@usgs.gov. 
For further information please contact Verita Friesner by e-mail at vfriesner@usgs.gov.

Standard designs will be provided for all the K-span buildings required in this IFB.<br>For several of the facilities associated with this project, the contractor will be afforded the opportunity to choose between K-span/rolled steel and CMU construction.  Disclaimer: The term K-Span refers to a proprietary arch span type structural system.  Whenever the term K-Span is used, it refers to a K-Span type system or its equivalent. <br> The Contractor may be required to coordinate the efforts required under this contract with at least one other contractor at the site.  The coordination effort may be significant and may include such tasks as the exchange of information with other contractors such as design data, drawings, calculations, and technical information.  Additionally, it may be necessary for the contractor to conduct meetings, hold teleconferences, and prepare the submittal of additional information to the Contracting Officer (KO) that demonstrates the coordination and integration of new work with existing and future work of other contractors.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will be issuing a solicitation for Loan Guaranty Services (LGY) for Veterans Benefits Administration Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office (VBAVACO).  The VA LGY currently has two (2) contract vehicles to service loans (approximately 20,000 loans) and to manage Real-Estate Owned (REO) property (approximately 15,000 properties).  These contracts cover all 50 States, territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. VA management has decided to merge the contracts into the Real Estate Owned and Portfolio Servicing Contract (RPSC) to reduce costs.  

The RPSC will be designed to improve efficiencies and enhances VA's ability to deliver the highest quality of home loans provided to America's veterans and active duty personnel. The program also provides federal home loan guarantees on residential property purchased by veterans and service members. As a byproduct of the guarantee program, the VA may become the holder of the REO and loans. The VA is seeking a contractor to manage LGY and REO under the RPSC Contract.

The requirement will be competed under full and open completion; therefore all responsible parties are encouraged to respond. Offerors shall meet all requirements as outlined in the solicitation. The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the FedBizOpps posting system at http://www.Fedbizopps.gov on or about July 13, 2011. Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is solely the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Sole Source for an OPMI Lumera 700, for Hines VA
VA-69D-11-RQ-1036

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 12, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 5000 W. National Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53295.

2.    Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  	Justification and approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition for the purchase of one (1) OPMI Lumera 700 ophthalmic OR microscope 	for the Edward Hines VA Hospital in Hines, IL per Purchase Request# 578-11-3-969-0168.  Award of a new firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  This procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with Metro Medical Equipment and Supply, Inc.				
		
3.    Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:   The Edward Hines VA Hospital has a requirement for one (1) OPMI Lumera 700 ophthalmic OR microscope, stock #00000L7041776227, along with add-on equipment.  The total for the system is $186,539.40.  Delivery is expected within 90 days of the Notice of Award.

4.    Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source (41 USC 253 (c)(1)).  

5.    Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The OPMI Lumera 700 ophthalmic OR microscope is the only product that has the following unique features: (1) both Xenon and Halogen Light sources; (2) patented stereo coaxial illumination for preferred red reflex illumination; and (3) ability to have independent focus for teaching/assistant scope.  In addition, the BIOM attachment we have for performing retina surgery is specifically designed to fit on this scope.  Furthermore, this is a backup scope for our current Zeiss Lumera scope.  Obtaining a different scope would be cost ineffective in requiring separate parts and servicing from different vendors.  This request is as a sole source with Zeiss through Metro Medical which is a sole source vendor for this product. The VA needs to be able to do the following:  The purpose of an ophthalmic surgical microscope is to provide the best visualization of the eye for performing cataract and retina intraocular surgery.  The Zeiss Lumera 700 is by far the best scope for this purpose. 

6.    Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:    Other vendor's products were evaluated but did not have all the required features. 

7.    Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The same items were purchased 6 times on FBO at comparable prices. 

8.    Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the   
       Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Dr. Pearlman reviewed the different 
ophthalmic microscopes available.  When we purchased our current Zeiss Lumera scope we had perofmed an extensive demonstration of both the Zeiss and Leica microscopes and the Zeiss scope was viewed to be the have the best optics and features compared to its leading competitor (and by extension to any other competitor on the market).  There is no question that purchase of the Zeiss Lumera is essential to provide the best patient outcomes for intraocular surgery.  A review of scopes on the internet also did not reveal any comparable brand able to perform to the requirements.
	
9.    Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  intends to award a sole source award to Metro Medical Supply for the purchase of an OPMI Lumera 700 Ophthalmology Floorstand Microscope.  Carl Zeiss Meditec is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Humphrey/Zeiss line of ophthalmic and surgical products.  The Zeiss/Humphrey line of ophthalmic diagnostic products is sold through direct sales representatives with geographic territory alignments.  Sales to the US federal government 
are sold through a contractual agreement with metro Medical Supply of St. Louis, Missouri.  

10.  Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None.

11.  A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  None.

12.  Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), proposes to noncompetitively issue a purchase order with Emerson Network Power, Liebert Services Inc., 610 Executive Campus Drive, Westerville, OH for a maintenance contract for two Liebert UPS's (Uninterruptable Power Supply  to service and maintain insuring proper function which will enable the Bureau to keep power to the server and phone exchange system in the event of a power failure. The JOFOC is posted at http://www.blm.gov/or/procurement/index.php. This requirement is for noncompetitive procurement with Emerson Network Power, Liebert Services Inc. The Liebert Company is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of this equipment so therefore they are the only company that can provide manufacturer certified technicians authorized to perform maintenance and upgrades to the equipment.  They are the only ones who can provide the correct OEM repair/replacement parts, programming and training.  Due to the highly technical nature of these systems and the need to stay current with the many updates in the programming and maintenance protocols, manufacturer certified technicians are required. Liebert trained technicians are the only ones that get the current field change notices and training on a timely and regular basis. Their technicians receive the current training as these updates occur. Liebert also guarantee a 4 hour emergency response time.   
A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>While CBP is in the early stages of migrating away from the mainframe, there are many critical applications that will continue to run throughout the migration over the next few years. CBP is currently conducting market research for potential competitive acquisition of annual software maintenance for those applications. In the past, the software has been procured separately for each application. In an effort to reduce processing time and become more cost effective, CBP is looking to consolidate the procurement of these software licenses for FY12. One vendor is needed to provide brand name software and annual maintenance from multiple manufacturers. <br /><br />Attachment Table 1 lists the required items, while Attachment&nbsp;Draft Provision Statement provides a more detailed description of each piece of software as it relates to CBP's needs.</p>

<DESC><strong>This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice.</strong> This is <strong>NOT</strong> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span></strong>The National Toxicology Program (NTP) organizes and conducts a comprehensive testing and research program focused on determining potential human health hazards due to exposure to chemicals, drugs or environmental agents. The Toxicology Branch supports these efforts through testing contracts which: (1) develop and establish methods with predictive value for identifying potentially immunotoxic chemicals and drugs; (2) examine selected agents employing a defined panel; and (3) conduct mechanistic studies to define the cellular and molecular events associated with immunotoxicity.<br /><br />This work is currently being conducted under contract N01-ES-55538 held by Virginia Commonwealth University.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives<br /></span></strong>The purpose of this requirement will be to support and assist the efforts of the NTP to determine the effects of certain chemicals, drugs, or other environmental agents on the immune system. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, any resultant contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials (including animals), equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to examine the immune system in laboratory animals following exposure to xenobiotics. The Government will only provide the chemicals or therapeutics on an "as needed basis".</p>
<p>This requirement shall also involve the development, evaluation, and validation of novel assays to determine the potential of xenobiotics to induce alterations in immune parameters and the investigation of the mechanistic basis for chemical-induced perturbations of immune function. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project requirements <br /></span></strong>The Tasks that will be performed under this requirement involve the utilization of a comprehensive immune testing panel that evaluates the major components of the immune system for potential suppression or enhancement, as well as hypersensitivity and autoimmunity. To screen for the potential of a test article to modulate the systemic immune response, the contractor should be able to assess non-specific, humoral- and cell-mediated immunity using functional measures as described in Luster et al., 1988 (Fundam Appl Toxicol 10:2-19) that quantitate immune system performance.</p>
<p>For selected compounds that are demonstrated to be positive in the screening studies, the contractor should be able to assess the performance of the hematopoietic system in generating specific stem cell populations and to evaluate resistance to disease and neoplasia using established models as part of more definitive studies.</p>
<p>The contractor should be able to evaluate changes in immune cell numbers and hematological parameters. These endpoints will be evaluated in 4-6 treatment groups of approximately 8 mice or rats following a 28-day adult exposure paradigm or following exposure from approximately day 6 of gestation through post natal day 42.</p>
<p>To assess the potential for a test article to induce dermal sensitization, the contractor should be able to evaluate the test compound in 4 treatment groups of 8 mice using a combined irritancy and local lymph node assay, and 4 treatment groups of 8 mice in the mouse ear swelling test.</p>
<p>The contractor should also be able to evaluate the potential for selected test articles to alter the development and progression of autoimmune disease using established models.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the potential for an individual test article to modulate systemic immunity, hypersensitivity, developmental immunotoxicity and autoimmunity will be considered single tasks with the understanding that multiple immune function tests will be conducted as part of a single task. The actual number of tasks will vary based on programmatic needs and availability of funds. The contractor will be expected to use the appropriate positive controls for each type of study.</p>
<p>In addition, any resultant contract will also require delivery of a monthly status report, animal use protocols, an annual report and a study report for each test article.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Studies to be Conducted under the Base Contract</span></strong></p>
<p>Study Type (Anticipated Number of Studies per Year)<br /><br />Immunomodulation/Screening (4)<br />Immunomodulation/Definitive (2)<br />Hypersensitivity (4)<br />Autoimmunity (1)<br />Developmental Immunotoxicity (4)</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated period of performance<br /></span></strong>The Base Contract is anticipated from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2015 with 7 optional 1 year periods of performance. If all options are exercised the period of performance shall extend through June 30, 2022.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other important considerations<br /></span></strong>All testing performed under this contract shall be conducted in accordance with GLP guidelines and where appropriate, NTP specifications (NTP, 2011). The contractor must have a currently functioning laboratory with demonstrated capability in conducting immunotoxicity studies. A currently functioning laboratory means that the facility has in place essential features necessary to conduct immunotoxicology studies of test articles designated by the NTP involving large groups of mice and rats (i.e. environmentally controlled animal rooms and appropriate exposure equipment). The laboratory must have the clinical laboratory equipment, tissue culture, necropsy, and histology facilities necessary to conduct the work described herein, and staff with appropriate expertise to expose, care for, and process large numbers of animals. In addition, all offerors must have AAALAC accredited animal facilities in which to conduct the studies. <br /><br />Electronic documents and reports are anticipated to be included in the deliverables of the resultant contract. When acquiring Electronic and Information Technology (EIT), the government is obligated to meet the accessibility standards at 36 CFR Part 1194 and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 6.302-1 to the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), for the performance of research and development (R&D), clinical studies for the project entitled Impact of Military Suicide on the Family Survivors in support of the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) and the United States Marine Corps (USMC).
This requirement will focus on the following objectives:

1.	The first objective of this task is to conduct telephone interviews with the family survivors of Marines who committed suicide over the last three years to assess the impact of the suicide on: (a) surviving spouse, child, and family health and well-being and (b) family functioning.
 
2.	The second objective is to: (a) catalogue the USMC-sponsored services and supports used by surviving families; (b) assess the degree to which services and supports have been helpful to survivors; and (c) understand gaps in services and supports.
 

3.	The third objective is to obtain surviving spouse post-mortem perceptions of signs/signals/symptoms of decedents suicidality. These objectives build off a literature review completed by Penn State regarding the impact of suicide on families conducted at no charge to the USMC in 2010.

The estimated value of this contract is $63,159.00 and the period of performance is anticipated to be for 12 months.  The Marine Corp Suicide Prevention Program (MCSPP) has an existing relationship with Penn State University (PSU) research department, Clearinghouse for Military Family Readiness.  PSU will design, implement and conduct a full study on family members of known Marines who died by suicide between 2007 and 2010.
 The final study will provide a number of deliverable products which will assist MCSPP in preparing policy and training solutions to specific needs or fill gaps in the postvention services. The PSU research department is experienced in this type of study and identified the study subject as a potential need for Marine Corp family support programs. PSU already has the tools, measurements and scales prepared, so the design phase of the study would be minimal. A sole source contract must be approved for this study as PSU has proprietary ownership of this particular study and focus.     

Based on these unique capabilities and the previous work completed, PSU is the only institution capable of meeting the Governments requirements.
  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data and other information sufficient to determine capability to perform the proposed contract effort.

All capability statements received by 2:00PM Eastern Time on July 19, 2011 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
  Capability statements shall be submitted by email ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil.

<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be Department of Veteran Affaris, National Acquisition Center, Hines, IL.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>None Reported</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than July 13, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<SUBJECT>Sole Source Justification for Streaming Rights to DVD Titles for Educator Professional Development on Differentiated Instruction

<DESC>The Department of Defense Education Activity's (DoDEA) intends to issue on a sole-source basis under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, an award to Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) based on the information below:<br /><br />Description of supplies and/or services: DoDEA requires all DoDEA principals to have electronic access to the ASCD DVDs entitled Leadership for Differentiating Instruction and The Common Sense of Differentiation. Both titles contain a series of workshops designed for use by educators interested in designing classrooms that maximize the potential of a full range of learners. Included are presentations that take the viewers into a variety of classrooms at different grade areas and across different subject areas to observe how teachers uncover learner needs, plan instruction to meet those needs and develop classroom routines that allow attention to a range of learner needs. Each title is accompanied by a facilitator guide that provides opportunities for addition exploration, application and key practices of effective differentiation for diverse learners. The requested purchase is for the rights to stream these DVDs over DoDEA's virtual learning environment and allow DoDEA to make 25 copies of the DVD's accompanying purchased facilitator guide. <br /><br />Reason the proposed contractor is the only source available: In 2009 DoDEA began planning a system wide rollout of a sustained comprehensive professional development initiative on differentiating instruction. The materials by ASCD and other vendors were vetted at the 2010 DoDEA Worldwide Administrator meeting. It was decided that ASCD was the only vendor capable of providing the professional material compatible with the DoDEA approved model of differentiated instruction. A notice for DoDEA's intent to award a sole source contract was posted on Federal Business Opportunities giving interested parties an opportunity to respond. No responses were received and a sole source firm fixed price contract was awarded to ASCD which included facilitator guides/DVDs for the titles. But due to end of fiscal year budget constraints the contract did not include streaming rights for Leadership for Differentiating Instruction and The Common Sense of Differentiation which both reinforce the training based on DoDEA's approved model. Both titles unique content warrant the use of sole source authority and have been adopted for use in DoDEA system wide professional development training on Differentiated Instruction. Consistent implementation and evaluation of the professional development initiative on professional development is crucial to DoDEA realizing its goals system wide. Market research determined that no other vendors can provide the streaming rights to the DVDs which are proprietary information belonging to ASCD. Because the DVDs are proprietary material only available from ASCD there are no alternatives other than a sole source contract with ASCD.
<p>Will these same supplies and/or services be needed again? Yes or No.:<br />A contract with a base year plus two twelve month option years is being requested to allow DoDEA the streaming rights to these two videos for DoDEA's professional development initiative. DoDEA subject matter experts will continually monitor new developments and additional sources that could possibly meet the organizations need. In addition DoDEA will annually examine if the streaming rights to the above listed DVDs meet the standard and level of professional development required for its educators. As requirements change and new alternatives for meeting them enter the marketplace, all interested parties are given the opportunity to compete.</p>
<p>Any responsible party that feels it has the capability to provide streaming rights meeting all of the requirements listed in this announcement may write to the referenced Contract Specialist. This announcement and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-16. Responses in regard to this announcement shall be submitted by July 6, 2011 by 12:00 PM (EST). The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided. All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered. If no affirmative written responses are received by the due date indicating a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with ASCD. Each Electronic and Information Technology supply or service furnished under this acquisition shall comply with the Electronic and Information Accessibility Standards (36 CFR 1194, see http://www.section508.gov/ ), except for supplies or services specifically identified by the contractor to the Contracting Officer prior to award. If the Contracting Officer determines any furnished supply or service does not conform to the Standards, the Contracting Officer will promptly inform the Contractor in writing. The contractor shall, without charge to the Government, repair or replace the non-compliant supply or service within the period of time the Government specifies. The Government requires streaming rights to the two titles for the period of one Base Year plus two Option Years.</p>
<p>The submission due date and time is Wednesday, July, 6 2011 by 12:00 PM (EST). The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) is a federal government agency, an education activity, tax exempt, and qualifies for academic/educational pricing. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Interested parties should ensure that their information in the Central Contractor Registration, http://www.ccr.gov/ is accurate and current. PSC Code: U009, Education. NAICS Code: 511130, Book Publishers. Size Standard: 500</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its Centers. The purpose of this RFI is to help the FDA understand the market availability, technical characteristics, and functionality of solutions, tools, or products capable of satisfying the technical, functional, and/or operational characteristics described in this RFI. FDA will use this market research information to assess the market's capability to provide a comprehensive solution to the requirements described in the RFI.
<p>FDA welcomes responses from all interested parties. FDA does not intend to make a selection decision or award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDA's use of such information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the FDA's evaluation of the information received. Additionally, the FDA does not intend to hold discussions concerning this RFI with any interested parties. However, FDA reserves the right to contact vendors if additional information is required.</p>
<p>1. Introduction.</p>
<p>The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Business Informatics is conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources for providing a web-based software application for automating forms and workflow to support two independent programs that support continuing education and scientific research, the Continuing Education (CE) program and Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) Fellowship Program. The FDA is committed to providing agency-wide, high-quality, innovative continuing medical, pharmacy and nursing education programs to FDA employees and stakeholders by supporting and sustaining their scientific expertise and professional development. The overall goal of the FDA's CE program is to build a lifelong learning infra-structure that supports and strengthens the integrated scientific foundation of its regulatory mission. Through continuous professional development activities, the FDA aims to address the scientific and professional development needs of its employees by improving professional competence, performance, and patient/public health outcomes. The Continuing Education Program provides continuing educational activities for physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and clinical and non-clinical scientists.</p>
<p>The CDER ORISE Fellowship Program is designed to provide practical scientific training for participants derived through the conduct and support of intramural research projects. All studies/projects are relevant or pertinent to the needs and mission of the FDA. This training program is designed to provide opportunities for participants to (1) continue their research training/education, (2) enhance their professional development in specific areas, (3) become familiar with the research areas within CDER or (4) become interested in future careers in fields related to the FDA mission. The Program's goal is to support the FDA's national commitment to science education, strengthen CDER's scientific and technical knowledge base by leveraging the educational programs offered by academic institutions and transfer knowledge and technology to the scientific community.</p>
<p>Both the CE and ORISE Fellowship Programs are aimed at promoting professional development of members of the scientific community. These two programs are run by organizations within the FDA that have limited staff and limited budget. Both organizations are following a set of manual processes to perform the functions that are required to make and keep these programs successful. The manual processes have been documented in detail, and put into the form of a User Requirements Document. It is the goal of this RFI to study options commercially available to automate these manual processes via a customizable COTS product or custom-built application to meet the requirements of each program.</p>
<p>2. Overview and Business Need<br /><br />The draft scope is as follows: On a fixed-price basis with a period of performance not to exceed one-year, the contractor shall provide technical and engineering expertise to automate the CE and ORISE processes. The objective of this RFI is to make a determination if any COTS automated systems are commercially available that will meet the needs of the CE and ORISE organization in order to automate the business processes. Via this automation, it is expected to:</p>
<p>&bull; Increase efficiency by automating manual processes, eliminating double entry and using on-line forms, on-line document management, email integration and automatic notifications of upcoming events.<br />&bull; Increase transparency for end users by providing ORISE Fellows, CE Developers and CE Participants a portal where they can view the status of their individual profiles and/or projects.<br />&bull; Reduce errors and improve accuracy through the use of automation. Currently, with both CE and ORISE, the use of paper based systems results in transcription errors, missing documents and missed deadlines. <br />&bull; Increase staff productivity by automating reports that are currently generated manually and providing additional reporting capabilities currently unavailable.<br />&bull; Generate and track Statements of Credit (CE Only) which are currently manually created and distributed for all participants for all CE activities in FDA<br />&bull; Generate and track funding and budget reports for each participating office. These reports will show amounts budgeted and actual expenses to-date for each project (ORISE only).</p>
<p>3. Functionality.</p>
<p>This Section lists the functionality required to successfully automate the CE and ORISE programs. These features should be included in the recommended technical solution.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Negotiate with One Source.  The Naval Facilities Command Pacific (NAVFAC Pacific) intends to increase the capacity of contract N62742-07-D-0005 competitively awarded to Richard Matsunaga & Associates Architects, Inc. (RMAA) pursuant to architect-engineer competitive process (see FAR 36.601-2 and 6.102(d)(1)) from $5,400,000 to $5,630,000 in order to allow issuance of modification(s) to complete post contract award services under an existing task order.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate the contract modification(s) with RMAA under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency Requirements.
  The proposed modification(s) are to provide post construction award services (e.g., design revisions, meetings, etc.) for the FY09 MCON P-200 Joint Operation and Support Complex, Singapore.   RMAA is the designer of record for the FY09 MCON P-200 Joint Support Facility and hence has the requisite knowledge and experience to continue providing the highly specialized post contract award services for the construction phase of the project.  If another contractor were to assume PCAS duties for P-200, it would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delay to the Government due to the learning curve involved in becoming familiar with the design and stake holders of the project, due to the construction permitting requirements already obtained by RMAA and its subcontractor as the designer of record, and due to the time and administrative cost associated with competing this requirement considering the proposed modification is for post contract award services for a construction contract that is currently on-going and expected to be completed March 2012.
 This is NOT a request for proposals, quotes, or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this notice is to identify other potential sources to perform post construction award services.  Interested parties may submit technical qualifications, which shall be considered, to A. Saki-Eli via electronic mail to ann.sakieli@navy.mil no later than July 13, 2011.  If the Government determines, based on the responses to this notice, that a full and open competition will be conducted, a synopsis will be issued in the Federal Business Opportunities web page announcing the solicitation.  Otherwise, the Government will proceed with negotiations with RMAA with no further notice.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a Request For Proposal later in Calendar Year 2011 for the modification of several of the US Navys Dry Deck Shelters (DDS).  The DDS, when installed on a Host Submarine, provides the capability to support various Special Operating Forces (SOF) missions.   DDS Extension (DDSX) program will primarily include the following efforts:

1.	To design, construct, install on a host submarine, certify for manned operations, and operationally test a fifty inch (50) extension to an existing DDS.  This 50 extension will be welded to the aft end of the existing hangar.  

2.	Develop improvements to the DDS Hangar Outer Door to allow remote operation (unlock, open/close, lock) of the door.

3.	Develop improvements to assist personnel in the deployment and retrieval of the track and cradle system from the extended shelter.
 

In support of the DDSX effort the Government will hold an Industry Day at Naval Special Warfare Group THREE  Detachment Little Creek (NSWG-3 Det LC) on 04 Aug 2011.  In addition to making a DDS available for review by any potential bidders, NSWG-3 Det LC personnel will provide all attendees an overview of DDS operations and NAVSEA will provide an overview of the planned scope of the DDSX Acquisition Program.  Attendees will be afforded the opportunity to ask questions about DDS operations or the DDSX efforts during the Industry Day.

NSWG-3 Det LC is located on Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Norfolk VA.  The physical address for the compound is 1875 Intercove Rd Norfolk VA 23521.
  All interested parties shall submit their intention to participate to Brian Pelletier, NAVSEA PMS399A4, brian.c.pelletier@navy.mil, and Jodie LaFreniere-Dajc, NASVEA 0264, jodie.dajc@navy.mil, the Government POCs for this effort before 22 Jul 2011.  Parties are requested to forward security clearance information for all attendees to NSWG-3 Det LC  via JPAS (SMO Code N088426, Ref: DDS Industry Day).  For parties not having access to JPAS security clearance information shall be forwarded to NSWG-3 Det LC POCs, Mr. William Snow,  William.Snow@nsweast.socom.mil, and PO1 Jermaine White, Jermaine.White@nsweast.socom.mil.

<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:vanessa.labyzon@navy.mil">MANOMETER_NAVAIR</a>
<DESC>The NAVAIR (NAVAL AIR Systems Command) Metrology and Calibration (METCAL) Program has a requirement for qty one (1) Schwien 1025FX Manometer upgrades (upgrade to 1025LX) to support units in the fleet that currently require frequent and extensive repair due to age.  The model 1025FX Schwien Manometer is and has been the Navy's highest accuracy source for pressure and is currently used at the Navy Primary Standards lab as well as all higher level calibration laboratories. The Schwien Manometer provides the prime calibration measurement support for precision pressure calibrators, air data calibrators, and various/numerous shipboard gauges.  It is the Navys intent to upgrade this equipment to avoid additional repairs which are becoming costly and more frequent.
  Existing instrument calibration procedures are currently in place for the model 1025 series Schwien Manometer. The current model 1025FX has been approved by the NAVAIR Metrology and Calibration program for measurement methodology and has passed the accuracies required by the NAVAIR METCAL Program including 3 inches of mercury in Absolute mode and an additional NAVAIR QC test.   This differential pressure test is required for model 3688A air data test set to do air speed at altitude.  Further data gathered to support alternative standards indicated that verification of uncertainty for other types of testers would require (NIST) calibration certification every three years.  This adds additional costs and downtime of approximately 3 months or more which is unacceptable to the Navy based on current workload schedules.
 The Government intends to award a sole-source, firm fixed price contract to Schwien Engineering, Pomona, CA. 91767 who is the original equipment manufacturer of the existing 1025FX manometers. This requirement will be awarded on a sole-source basis I n accordance with the statutory authority 10 u. S. C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1(c).  This procurement is for commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The associated NAICS Classification is 334513 and the size standard is 500 employees.  No solicitation will be issued but responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or requests for information
 to Vanessa Labyzon at vanessa.labyzon@navy.mil or interested parties may inquire by phone at (951) 273-4351.
  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NOTE 22.

<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Shade Integrated Process Team (IPT) was established in 2007 to address issues related to Government shade assessment and acceptance procedures.  Industry members, along with key Service and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) personnel, met to define and discuss shade related problems.  The top issues addressed were the process of establishing standard samples for shade, tolerance determination, understanding the failure review process, waiver assessment, and communication issues.  The results of the meetings were flowcharts and assessment process maps of the current and ideal processes.  Other team accomplishments included:

Inclusion of standard sample roll reference on shade reports
Dissemination of the spectrophotometer readings on standard samples rolls (CIELAB values)
Immediate distribution of the electronic Request for and Results of Test (DD 1222) for failing shade reports 
A dictionary of Shade Terms used by the Government labs
Simplification of the process of development of shade tolerances 
Established and standardized the process for shade processes for all Services
Established liaison with the DLA equipment evaluation study
Obtaining fabric samples without solicitation (drafted for review)
Defined shade roles and responsibilities

During 2010-11, the team identified five key areas that warranted further investigation.
  As a result, five charters were drafted for action by members.  These charters included:

Standard samples in the correct substrate not available for solicitation
Tolerance not provided to Industry
Post cure shade acceptance process
Waivers
Standards Maintenance

The meeting minutes for 2010 - 2011 are attached for reference.  Any questions can be directed to Debbie Peppenelli, Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility, dpeppenelli@nctrf.natick.army.mil or by phone (508) 233-4119 x115.

It provides timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and pilot opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses. Instead, it focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed adoption of emerging technology solutions to DoD user needs.</p>
<p>Companies interested in applying for participation in this workshop should contact DeVenCI via e-mail at devenci@osd.mil for an application. All applications must be received on or before July 18, 2011.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this Special Notice is to&nbsp;announce a sole-source award&nbsp;for Lead IT Architect Services for support of the Trademarks-Next Generation project.<br /><br />ESTIMATED DOLLAR AWARD AMOUNT: $175,000</p>
<p>ESTIMATED CONTRACT AWARD DATE: June 29, 2011</p>

Interview USPTO customers, contractors, System Development Leads (SDLs) and other USPTO staff as necessary to gather system related issues, interdependencies, user requirements, desired software architecture, and envisioned software coding standard;<br />b. Evaluate best industry and government practices and recommend the practices that can be effectively implemented at the USPTO;<br />c. Evaluate interdependent AISs and provide recommendations on how the systems can be decoupled;<br />d. Participate in reviews with steering committees and senior management; and<br />e. Review existing strategy, plans, work in progress, target options and transformation plans to date. <br />The Lead Consulting Architect shall: <br />a. Use advanced technical knowledge and communications skills to facilitate complex situations;<br />b. Serve as an advisor for and provide direction with indirect reporting relationships; and<br />c. Interact day-to-day with technologists, management, project management, contract developers, government developers, and other architects.<br />d. Working with the USPTO technologists and management, define and document the current and future state architecture of the Trademark systems and propose a migration strategy from the current state to the future state.</p>
<p>PROPOSED CONTRACTOR: Tactical Strategy Group, Inc.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR NON-COMPETITION: <br />The Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) specifically exempts USPTO from the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA - 41 USC 253).</p>
<p>The supplies or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.</p>
<p>William Ulrich of the Tactical Strategy Group, Inc. is sought for Subject Matter Expert services pertaining to the Trademarks-Next Generation (TM-NG). Mr. Ulrich possesses a unique set of qualifications and is the only individual that can continue to provide direction and guidance to the TM NG Business and IT Architecture teams in the development of the TM NG current and future state value streams, capability mapping and IT solutions.</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich has the unique ability and expertise to deconstruct business architectures and IT architectures to deliver the cross-functional, cross disciplinary visibility required to enable complex business/IT transformations. Additionally, Mr. Ulrich possesses the unique ability to determine the viability of a given business/IT transformation strategy from a fully independent perspective. Based on this unique ability and experience, the USPTO contracted with TSG for Mr. Ulrich to prepare and deliver an assessment of the proposed TM NG Program.</p>
<p>The resulting report, Trademark Business / IT Transformation Strategy Assessment Report, was submitted on December 16, 2010. There are numerous recommendations in the report that the TM NG Program has accepted and is currently implementing. One of the most significant findings in the report is that TM does not have a Business Architecture (BA). Without a Business Architecture to describe the current and future state of the TM business capability needs, the TM NG Program will not be able to plan and deliver business-driven IT solutions. The report recommendation based on the findings is to create a BA for TM and base the TM NG IT Architecture on the BA. USPTO, OCIO and TM senior leadership accepted this recommendation.</p>
<p>The TM organization did not have the in-house expertise or capability to develop a Business Architecture (BA). The decision was made to develop the internal capability and expertise to produce and maintain the TM BA. Mr. Ulrich is uniquely qualified to guide this BA team through the process of creating the TM BA and has done so since February 2011. With Mr. Ulrich's expertise and guidance, the TM BA team has made substantial progress in defining and mapping the TM business value streams and business capabilities of the current state and are identifying capability needs that will form the basis of the future state BA.</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich's unique expertise and experience with the TM BA effort and team is required in order to complete the current state BA and develop the future state BA. After the TM BA work is completed, the TM NG Program will use the unique qualifications of Mr. Ulrich to help translate the TM BA into the TM NG IT Architecture and solutions that will meet the TM business needs in a manner consistent with other accepted recommendations from the Trademark Business / IT Transformation Strategy Assessment Report.</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD  intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Life Technologies Corporation (Invitrogen), 5791 Van Allen Way, CA 92008-7313 for 100 vials of SYBR Green-1 Nucleic Acid Dye. The dye is required to support the in vitro drug screening of the most deadly form of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum. Invitrogen has provided Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) with SYBR Green-1 Nucleic Acid Dye in the past that has undergone rigorous quality control to ensure that it achieves the requisite amount of RFU (Relative Florescence Units) to support robust statistical assay standards. The dye previously acquired from Invitrogen has been tested and found to support the Malaria SYBR Green-1 based Fluorescence (MSF) assay using all Plasmodium falciparum isolates used in the Experimental Therapeutics (WRAIR) anti-malaria drug screen. It is essential for the drug screens to have consistent RFU readings for the assay systems and using inferior SYBR Green-1 Nucleic Acid Dye would stop all laboratory operations at the WRAIR Drug Program. The SYBR Green-I Nucleic Acid Dye from Invitrogen has been validated with the Malaria SYBR Green-I based Fluorescence (MSF) assay, over several years and on the malaria strains used in Experimental Therapeutics (D6, C235, W2, and C2B).  The re-validation of an assay using another product will cost an estimated $12,000 for new testing taking an estimated 6 to 8 months. Research at four other labs that depend on the results of the MSF Assay will stop with the SYBR Green-1 Nucleic Acid Dye during the requalification of an assay from another product.<br><br>     This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. The reference number listed in this notice is the PR number and not the solicitation number. All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide services outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received, within 15 days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. Response to this award is to be sent to roman.laterza@amedd.army.mil.<br><br><br>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) Fort Detrick, Maryland intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to R&D Scientific, 272 US Highway 206 Flanders, NJ 07836-9081 for installation and calibration of ten -40 to 60 deg C Datatron temperature probes to 8 incubators, 1 refrigerator and 1 freezer. The probes are necessary due to equipment shutting down with valuable items within their storage. The necessity of installing Datatron probes to monitor the fluctuation of the temperatures will assist Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) by inhibiting loss of valuable items, research and data for the mission within Malaria and Leishmania protocols. R&D Scientific has proprietary rights on the Datatron 3001 system that uses company passwords that allow for the calibration of the system. WRAIR previously installed the Datatron monitoring system for the entire institute and new pieces of laboratory equipment must be equipped with Datatron compatible probes in order to monitor temperature.<br><br>This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for a competitive quote. No solicitation document is available for this notice. Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Government's requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.

POSITION TITLE: Security and Personnel Recovery Advisor <br />6. MARKET VALUE: FS-02 (GS-14 Equivalent)<br />7. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year from the date of award <br />8. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Mexico City, Mexico <br />9. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>US Personal Services Contract<br />US Department of State<br />Bureau for International Narcotics &amp; Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)<br />American Embassy Mexico City, Mexico<br />Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS)</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR<br />Currently, Mexico is considered a high risk, volatile environment, and is not in compliance with National Security Presidential Directive 12, Annex 1 (NSPD-12); "Personnel Recovery and the Prevention of Hostage Taking." There has been a violent surge in drug-related killings and more than 3,000 executions have occurred in 2010. It is imperative that the US Embassy establishes head recovery operations in Mexico, especially as the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) expands its field operations. In Mexico, NAS is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of international narcotics (CN) control assistance activities and criminal justice issues for the Department of State (DOS).</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this Personal Service Contract (PSC) is to provide a Security and Personnel Recovery Advisor who will be responsible for advising the NAS on security and developing Mexico's Mission wide-in-country Interagency Personnel Recovery Program (IPRP). The Advisor will act as the Personnel Recovery Officer (PRO) for the IPRP. This program is mission critical due to the significant increase in danger and threats to Americans working and living in Mexico. Currently, there is no dedicated NAS resource to the early recognition of when Americans are in circumstances of danger. Given the growth and complexity of the expanded Merida Initiative, especially in Government of Mexico (GOM) training outside of Mexico City, potential threats have exponentially increased.</p>
<p>The Advisor will advise and coordinate with the Regional Security Officer (RSO) in Country and the appropriate Host Nation parties on all aspects of personnel recovery to include the application of current U.S. Policy. The Advisor will coordinate and integrate Host Nation and U.S. Civil Search and Rescue capabilities into multi-national, multi-agency recovery architecture.</p>
<p>The Advisor will develop and coordinate an IPRP on behalf of the United States government (USG), under GOM authority. The focus of the IPRP will be to gain early recognition of when Americans are in circumstances of danger, or beyond an acceptable level of risk, and intercede to return them to safety prior to greater harm. When such efforts are ineffective and Americans are taken hostage, undertake appropriate actions to secure their freedom, and when returned from captivity, manage the provision of post-recovery support. The Advisor will also be the principal advisor to NAS on security issues, especially as they relate to field operations.</p>
<p>Supervisory Controls <br />The Advisor will serve under the day-to-day direction of the Regional Security Officer (RSO) and will advise the NAS on security issues. All employees under Chief of Mission authority who are assigned Security and Personnel Recovery duties will work with the Advisor, to ensure oversight and non-duplicative efforts in the Mission. The Advisor will coordinate with and integrate Host Nation and U.S. Civil Search and Rescue capabilities into multi-national, multi-agency recovery architecture.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities <br />Serve as the Advisor to the RSO, Country Team, and appropriate Host Nation parties on all aspects of Personnel Recovery (PR) to include the application of current US Policy, compliance with NSPD-12 Annex 1. In addition, advise on all aspects of personnel recovery to include the application of current US doctrine, which includes compliance with NSPD-12 Annex 1 as follows:</p>
<p>a. Serve as the Advisor to the NAS on security issues, especially as they relate to field operations.</p>
<p>b. Familiar with Non-Conventional Assisted Recovery (NCAR) and the application of those principles and capabilities in support of an Interagency PR program for U.S. Mission Mexico.</p>
<p>c. Coordinate, under the direction of the RSO, and in accordance with the Emergency Action Committee, guidance for the development of Annex G of the Emergency Action Plan (Personnel Recovery and Hostage Taking).</p>
<p>d. Manage individual and collective PR training as required by the USG and published policy or directives.</p>
<p>e. Ensure synchronization of IPRP with extant Life Safety and accountability measures, such as travel approval process and travel warnings.</p>
<p>f. Advise on the difference between "missing" and "isolated" persons and integrate a process for analyzing the circumstances of an event and the associated risks toward recovery and invocation of proper authority prior to action.</p>
<p>g. Assist interagency partners with planning, preparation, and execution of their PR requirements.</p>
<p>h. Facilitate periodic PR Work Groups to heighten collective awareness with regard to PR matters and foster support for PR among all constituents at Post.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of OR Equipment Drapes. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor (s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong><em>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.</em></strong>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is September 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil and COM 011-49-6221-172109 or Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil and COM 011-49-6221-172106.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of OR Equipment Drapes. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $482,744.93. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, seventy-two (72) of the total one hundred and thirty-six (136) line items represent the top twenty-one (21) products and accounts for 80.10% ($386,772.06) of the total volume in sales ($482,744.93) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 10 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the RFIAQ to Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil or Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil .</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Europe via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO Europe reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>

This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). Two (2) samples of each type/size listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>1. Drape slush approximately, approximately 44x66 inches - 2 per MTF/CPT member<br />2. Drape X-ray C-arm, approximately 41x72 inches - 2 per MTF/CPT member<br />3. Drape camera, approximately 5x96 inches - 2 per MTF/CPT member<br />4. Drape microscope, approximately 17x23inches - 2 per MTF/CPT member</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation will be conducted using the below listed requirements with responses as either a "YES" (meets/passes requirements) or "NO" (does not/fails to meet requirements) answers. The MMESO JPRB has established that the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization will be eighty percent (80%) of the requirements questions answered as "YES" (meets/passes requirements). Vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative.<br />A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review. Each evaluator will evaluate each OR Equipment Drape product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line.</p>
<p>There will be approximately sixteen (16) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning procedures the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below: <br />1. AORN Standards and Recommended Practices - The equipment drape must allow visibility of equipment. The OR equipment drape must be made of clear plastic (synthetic polymer) allowing the OR personnel to maintain visibility of the device for operational purposes without compromising sterility.<br />2. AORN Recommended Standards &amp; Joint Commission NPSG.07.05.01- The equipment drape accurately and efficiently covers the OR equipment device maintaining the shape of the device and provides sterile barrier between the equipment and the sterile field. The OR equipment drape must provide a sterile barrier for the equipment it is covering before being introduced to or brought over a sterile field. Only sterile items should touch sterile surfaces.<br />3. Joint Commission NPSG.07.05.01 - The equipment drape must be made from heavy gauge material to help reduce the possibility of pinholes or tears. The OR equipment drape must be resistant to punctures and tears to prevent microbial contamination of the sterile field.</p>
<p>Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement.</strong> The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the post-standardization cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of OR Drapes. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor (s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.</strong>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is September 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Mr. Robert Halliday, MMESO Europe Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil and 011-49-6221-172109 or Mr. Tom Winkle, MMESO Europe Team Leader, tom winkel@us.army.mil and 011-49-6221-172106.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of OR Drapes. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,552,522.09. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top fifteen (15) cluster groups of the total sixty-two (62) clustered groups accounts for 81.10% ($1,259,214.52) of the total volume in sales ($1,552,522.09) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 15 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Robert Halliday, MMESO Europe, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil and Mr. Tom Winkle, Team Leader, tom.winkle@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Europe via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission.

Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM EST for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. <strong>Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process.</strong> Vendor must send the MMESO Europe verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. Five (5) samples of each type/size sterile drape listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>1. Drape surgical U-drape (disposable) adhesive strip impervious, sterile, approximately 60 x 70inches<br />2. Drape surgical extremity fenestrated reinforced/impervious tube holder, sterile, approximately 106 x 129inches<br />3. Drape surgical laparotomy fenestrated adhesive strip, sterile, approximately 104x76x120inches fenestrated adhesive<br />4. Drape surgical shoulder fenestrated adhesive strip pouch with drain, sterile, approximately 160 x 105inches,</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)-Completely Unacceptable, two (2)-Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)-Partially Unacceptable, four (4)-Acceptable, and five (5)-Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. Each evaluator will evaluate each OR Drape product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twenty-two (22) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning procedures the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below: <br />1. AST Standard of Practice VI - Drape material and performance - The OR drape's folding, draping, and flexibility allows the product to function properly in the operating room. The OR drape material must be flexible in order to conform to the contour of the patient and OR table during the operating procedure without compromising sterility.<br />2. AST Standard of Practice III - Drapes must be resistant to fluid penetration - The OR drape resists saturation and any penetration of liquids. The OR drape must effectively resist saturation and /or any liquid penetration to maintain sterility during the operating procedure. <br />3. AST Standard of Practice II - A compromise in the integrity of the microbial barrier results in contamination - The OR drape does not tear and/or perforate during the surgical procedure. The OR drape must effectively resist tears and/or perforations to maintain sterility during the operating procedure.<br />4. AST Standard of Practice VI - Drape material and performance - The construction of the OR drape is of good quality. The OR drape's construction must have the correct fenestration size for the surgical procedure, critical areas around the fenestration must be reinforced, and the construction must have the lowest lint particles possible.<br />5. AST Standard of Practice VI - Drape material and performance - Drape placement and unfolding directions must be clearly visible and understandable. The directions for OR drape's must be clearly visible and understandable reducing any error in placement reducing contamination of the surgical site.</p>
<p>Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement.</strong> The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<BR><BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products.<BR><BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or<BR><BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.<BR><BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offerors relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offerors TIN.

A foreign entity that is treated as an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code at 26 U.S.C. 7874 (or would be except that the inversion transactions were completed on or before March 4, 2003), is also an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of 6 U.S.C. 395 and for this solicitation provision (see FAR 9.108). (2) Representation. By submission of its offer, the offeror represents that it is not an inverted domestic corporation and is not a subsidiary of one. (o) Sanctioned activities relating to Iran.

(D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. 

Registered in the CCR database means that 

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and 

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record Active. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. 

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. 

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offerors name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. 

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. 

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number 

(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or 

(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. 

(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: 

(i) Company legal business. 

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. 

(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code. 

(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and ZIP Code (if separate from physical).

(ix) Line of business (industry). 

(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). 

(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. 

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. 

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 

(1) 

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. 

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

<p>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase a Location and Tracking Systems.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing test methodology for evaluating the performance of fire fighter location and tracking systems. NIST is seeking to purchase at least one (1) location and tracking systems (LTS) to help guide the development of the tests. Since LTS are currently a very active area of research and development, and there are several very different approaches being pursued to determine the geospatial position of fire fighters in GPS-denied environments, NIST is seeking sources of LTS that are commercially available. The purchase of more than one (1) system is dependent on availability of funds. NIST's priority is to purchase two or more systems with different technologies. NIST has previously acquired an LTS that uses GPS-corrected inertial technology for fire fighter positioning, therefore, an additional purchase of this combination of technologies will be redundant and will not be considered at this time.</p>
<p>****All interested Contractor's shall provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p><br />Line Item 0001: Quantity Location and Tracking Systems. The systems must meet or exceed all of the minimum specifications identified herein. All equipment must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>To be considered for this project, the LTS must conform to the following technical specifications:</p>
<p>1. The LTS shall be fully functional in a GPS-denied environment.<br />2. The LTS shall be capable of locating at least 4 fire fighters simultaneously.<br />3. The LTS shall be fully functional in an environment in which flames, heat, smoke, dust and water are present.<br />4. The LTS shall not employ GPS-corrected inertial technology for determining position.<br />5. The LTS shall include, at a minimum, a user interface and all necessary software, clips, harnesses, batteries, chargers for full operation.<br />6. The LTS shall provide position location to the user in near-real time.<br />7. The total cumulative weight of all body-worn LTS components shall be less than 4.5 kg per person.<br />8. The LTS shall locate the position of fire fighters in three dimensions.</p>
<p><br />***The Contractor shall provide a minimum one (1) year warranty on all components including on-site repair. The Contractor shall be responsible for the system during transit. All costs including parts, labor, travel, and other expenses necessary to repair any machine equipment will be borne solely by the contractor at no additional cost to the U.S. Government. ***</p>
<p>***Delivery shall be provided not later than 60 days after receipt of an order. Delivery shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. ***</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the Offeror that provides the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote. Technical acceptability means that the quote meets all of the stated minimum specifications. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting the Requirement," and 2) Price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation.

<DESC>Project: Hawaiian Monk Seal Public Service Announcement
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />Background and Statement of Need <br />NOAA Fisheries Service invites your company to submit a written proposal to develop and produce a 30-second video Public Service Announcement to support Hawaiian monk seal recovery efforts.</p>
<p>NOAA Fisheries Service Pacific Islands Regional Office's (PIRO) Protected Resources Division (PRD) is dedicated to protecting and recovering endangered and threatened species of sea turtles, monk seals and cetaceans as mandated by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Through management, conservation and recovery efforts, and public outreach and education, NOAA strives to ensure the recovery and survival of the protected marine species of the Pacific Islands Region for future generations.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian monk seal is a high priority for NOAA management and recovery efforts. The Hawaiian monk seal population is in a crisis situation with the current estimated total number of seals at approximately 1,100 individuals, declining at a rate of 4% per year. Despite the fact that Hawaiian monk seals are one contiguous species, the subpopulations in the NWHI and MHI face different threats. In the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, primary threats include food limitation for juveniles, shark predation on juveniles, entanglement in marine debris, male seal aggression on females and juveniles, and shoreline habitat loss. Threats in the main Hawaiian Islands include disease and various types of human-induced impacts, such as disturbance at haul-out areas, fishery interactions, feeding and other interactions that cause habituation to humans, and most recently, intentional killings.</p>
<p>For most of our ocean-based community members, an encounter with a monk seal is a new and unfamiliar experience. Some people in Hawai&lsquo;i are understandably having difficulties adjusting to the recent population growth of monk seals in the main Hawaiian Islands, and to the resulting recent increase in NOAA Fisheries activities to manage human-seal interactions. With increased recovery efforts, monk seals have received significant media coverage, and various sectors of the public have begun expressing a wide range of positions reflecting widely varying degrees of awareness and understanding. While many people in Hawaii value the endangered animals with which we share our ocean and beaches, there is continued animosity toward Hawaiian monk seals from some people and ocean user groups, often fueled by misconceptions and misinformation. For example, a recent public perception survey suggests that almost 40% of respondents either believe seals are not native or don't know if seals are native. Similarly concerning, almost 40% of respondents believe that the Hawaiian monk seal population is either stable or increasing. NOAA Fisheries Service is enacting a wide-reaching outreach initiative to engage communities and user groups in Hawaiian monk seal conservation and recovery.</p>
<p>Goals and Objectives <br />Goal: Creatively convey an engaging message, disseminated through a 30-second video spot, to create and improve awareness about the Hawaiian monk seal. The theme will address one, or a combination of, the following messages:</p>
<p>&bull; Hawaiian monk seals are an indigenous endangered species, unique to the beach and waters around the Hawaiian Archipelago<br />&bull; The overall monk seal population is declining and in crisis, despite the recent increase in the main Hawaiian Islands sub-population.<br />&bull; Hawaiian monk seals do have representation and importance in Hawaiian culture<br />&bull; Hawaiian monk seals and humans can co-exist and share the beach and waters around Hawaii<br />&bull; NOAA Fisheries is mandated to protect monk seals and needs the community's cooperation and support to help recover the monk seal population</p>
<p>Objectives:<br />&bull; Engage viewers with a creative, memorable message that will become the core of an extended monk seal outreach campaign to support species recovery <br />&bull; Increase awareness about monk seals and promote a culture of responsible human-monk seal co-existence</p>
<p>The target audience is the general public, primarily ocean users of all ages. The 30-second spot will air on local television stations, and will be circulated online through the NOAA monk seal website and social media.</p>
<p>Scope of Work<br />The company will provide:<br />&bull; Message/slogan development<br />&bull; Story boarding<br />&bull; Script writing<br />&bull; Voiceover and talent<br />&bull; Location shoot (contract budget not intended to fund travel from the mainland for an extensive location shoot)<br />&bull; Editing</p>
<p>The scope of this project will entail working collaboratively with PRD staff and partners to develop an effective PSA to engage viewers and promote familiarity with, and knowledge of, Hawaiian monk seals.</p>
<p>Specific Tasks</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for performing the following tasks:<br />1.

Observe and document a focus group session conducted by PRD to evaluate the effectiveness of a draft version of the PSA, and incorporate the results of the focus group in a subsequent version of the PSA.*<br />4. Produce 30-second video spot for use as a broadcast television PSA, as well as online distribution. Spot must be closed-captioned.</p>
<p>* PRD may utilize a focus group(s) to conduct market research and testing to evaluate and revise a draft version of the PSA. The Contractor will not be responsible for creating and running the focus group.</p>

<p>To Be Provided by the Government</p>
<p>PRD staff will meet with the Contractor on a regular basis (at least two times per month) to provide direction regarding the completion of the tasks and PRD staff will be available to participate in meetings related to completion of Task 1. PRD will supply to the Contractor upon request copies of available relevant PRD reports, documentation and digital media relevant to completion of the tasks. PRD will be responsible for the focus group described in Task 3.</p>
<p>To Be Provided by the Contractor</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide personnel, materials, equipment, supplies and all other items necessary to fully perform the requirements specified in this statement of work. The Contractor will observe and document the reactions, input, etc., of the focus group described in Task 3, and incorporate the focus group results into a subsequent version of the PSA.</p>
<p>Quality Assurance</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be required to provide informal verbal progress reports as frequently as deemed necessary by PRD. The Contractor's activities shall be performed in close cooperation and coordination with PRD staff. The Government will assess Contractor performance throughout the performance period and will review all deliverable products for compliance to requirements.

The deliverables will be considered accepted by the Government if no deficiencies have been identified.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance for this project is expected to be nine months (~ 270 days), beginning on the date of contract award.</p>
<p>Information Security in Acquisitions</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br />Evaluation Criteria <br />Evaluation Criteria and Basis for Award for <br />Hawaiian Monk Seal Behavior Public Service Announcement</p>
<p><br />Minimum Qualifications</p>
<p>The offeror must have a minimum of three years experience creating PSA television spots for culturally diverse audiences. <br /><br />Basis for Award</p>
<p>The basis for award of a contract as a result of this Request for Proposal (RFP) will be an integrated assessment by the Government of the results of the evaluation based on the evaluation factors listed below. Technical and past performance considerations are more important than cost. The three categories and criteria are weighted as indicated below.</p>
<p>I. Technical Approach (40%)</p>
<p>The offerors' proposals shall show the offerors' organization and plan for successfully executing the Statement of Work. Proposals must address the organization's approach for each evaluation factor:<br /><br />1) The approach to working with PIRO to meet the requirements stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>2) Method of developing a creative and engaging message.</p>
<p>3) The approach to creating a PSA television spot that meets the project objectives.</p>
<p>II. Capacity and Past Performance (40%)</p>
<p>The offeror must provide evidence that they have the capacity and experience to complete the project. Contact information for previous clients and employers should be provided. Proposals must address the organization's qualifications for each evaluation factor.</p>
<p>1) Experience creating effective PSA television spots for culturally diverse audiences in Hawaii. <br />2) Experience creating PSA television spots that can be both presented on broadcast stations or via the internet. <br />3) Adequate staffing to create and market-test message, develop PSA content, and produce video within a nine-month time frame. <br />4) Language and cultural communication expertise to reach target audiences, including those in culturally diverse communities.</p>
<p>III. Cost (20%)</p>
<p>Each cost proposal in the competitive range will be subjected to a cost evaluation. For the purposes of this procurement, technical factors and past performance are considered more important than cost. However, in the event the proposals of two or more offerors receive comparable technical scores, cost may be used to determine which offer provides the best value to the Government. Cost proposals should include categories for salary, including rates, travel, supplies and expenses, overhead or profit, and others as needed to fully describe the cost of implementing the proposed work plan. Any expenses or tasks which are optional should be so indicated.</p>

<DESC>NOAA (AOML) and the Navy (ONR) have agreed to collaborate on the installation and operation of a Doppler Wind Lidar (2 micron laser with a side mounted bi-axial scanner) on a NOAA P3. It is planned that this system will be deployed by NOAA. This Doppler Wind Lidar (OWL) system is a "one-of-a-kind" and was flown for the first time on a Navy P3 in 2008. It is a research instrument and is still under development. The data collection and processing software is of research grade and thus NOAA requires the presence of the software developer Simpson Weather Associates Inc during all phases of the research program. In order to expedite the utility of the OWL data, it is critical that NOAA have the system developer and PI perform the data processing, QC and distribution functions until such time that NOAA can do so internally. Since NOAA intends to use this, or a similar instrument, in the future, training of NOAA personnel in its operations is also needed. While the Navy (ONR) is providing the instrumentation (value&gt; $3M), NOAA has agreed to accommodate and operate the instrument

<p>Scope of Work<br />Prescribed Burning - Code 338<br />USDA-NRCS Easement Programs <br />Background:<br />The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) is a voluntary program offering private landowners the opportunity to protect, restore, and enhance wetlands through the conveyance of a conservation easement to the United States of America. The United States Department of Agricultural (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) administers WRP. The goal of the program is to restore wetlands functions and values and associated uplands on all acres enrolled. The program provides landowners with the opportunity to establish long-term conservation and wildlife practices for the benefit of restored habitats.<br />An essential conservation practice in restoring enrolled lands is the application of prescribed burning in an ecologically sound manner. A large portion of the ecological communities restored or enhanced under the WRP are fire sub-climax communities that have evolved and are dependent upon periodic burning. Under natural conditions, lightening was the source of fire introduction into Florida's fire dependent ecosystems. In an effort to maintain this ecologically important function, the timely application of the NRCS Conservation Practice Standard Prescribed Burning - Code 338 to predetermined areas is critical. It is anticipated that Prescribed Burning - Code 338 will be required on tracts as small as 20 - 50 acres, to areas as large as several hundred acres per application. <br />Official definitions from Florida Statute 590.125 and FAC 5I-2:<br />"Prescribed burning means the controlled application of fire in accordance with a written prescription for vegetative fuels under specified environmental conditions while following appropriate precautionary measures that ensure that the fire is contained to a predetermined area to accomplish the planned fire or land-management objectives". "Prescription means a written plan establishing the criteria necessary for starting, controlling, and extinguishing a prescribed burn". "Smoke sensitive areas are areas within which, for reasons of visibility, health or human welfare, smoke could have an adverse impact."<br />The purpose of this conservation practice is to:<br />1) Control undesirable vegetation<br />2) Reduce wildfire hazards<br />3) Improve wildlife habitat<br />4) Improve plant production quantity and/or quality<br />5) Remove slash and debris<br />6) Restore and maintain ecological communities</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS:<br />Proposals are requested periodically from interested firms. Proposals must address each criterion listed below.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND PROPOSALS ARE HEREBY BEING REQUESTED. Solicitation NRCS-FL-11-04 is issued as a request for proposals (RFP's). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-52. The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Gainesville Florida State Office intends to award Multiple Award IDIQ contracts to sources capable of providing and installing barbed wire fencing on Wetland Restoration projects (WRP) which vary in acreage from 500-11,000 acres plus/minus.
<p>SCOPE OF WORK: <br />Background: The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) is a voluntary program offering private landowners the opportunity to protect, restore, and enhance wetlands through the conveyance of a conservation easement to the United States of America. The United States Department of Agricultural (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) administers WRP. The goal of the program is to restore wetlands functions and values and associated uplands on all acres enrolled. The program provides landowners with the opportunity to establish long-term conservation and wildlife practices for the benefit of restored habitats.</p>
<p>An important conservation practice often used to ensure restored properties to attain their long-term restoration goals requires the installation of Fence - Code 382 in accordance to NRCS standards and specifications. Fence - Code 382 is used to establish a barrier for animals, most typically livestock, and people in an effort to control access. Controlling access through the establishment of effective boundary fence is often required for NRCS conservation easements to protect structural and managerial type conservation practices to allow practices to perform properly and remain functional through their intended life. Many of NRCS's conservation easements, especially those associated with wetland restoration, utilize the positive effects of controlled livestock grazing, Prescribed Grazing - Code 528, as a management practice to achieve desired ecological community structure and function. The use of interior crossing fencing is essential in controlling the timing, frequency, duration, and intensity of livestock grazing on NRCS restored easement properties. Fence - Code 382 is also used to establish livestock enclosures or Access Control - Code 472 to temporary or permanently exclude animals, people, vehicles and/or other equipment from an area needing protection. It is anticipated Fence - Code 382 will be required at levels ranging from hundreds of feet to 10 miles in length depending on the circumstances of the project area.</p>
<p>THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONSERVATION PRACTICE IS TO:<br />1) Protect newly planted areas from disturbance until plant establishment.<br />2) Protect sensitive environmental areas from animal or human traffic.<br />3) Reduce erosion and water quality degradation by controlling livestock access, to streams, springs, wetlands, and ponds.<br />4) Improve the distribution and timing of livestock grazing.<br />5) Facilitate the handling, movement, watering, and feeding of livestock.<br />6) Protect people, livestock, or wildlife from hazardous areas.</p>

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:


        Lowest price, technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate for this award as the best    
        value. 
        
      a) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY

      Technical capability will be determined solely by submission of a quote. By submission of a 
       quote the offeror certifies compliance with all specifications. 


            b) PAST PERFORMANCE

            An offerors past performance information will be used to make a determination of whether the 
            offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance. Provide performance history and reference 
            for three (3) prior, similar contracts performed within the past three years.
 Past performance 
            information should be provided on the attached Contractor Performance Evaluation Survey. A 
            copy should be sent to your customers meeting the criteria stated above. Please ask them to 
            submit a completed copy directly to Sarah Nickerson at sarah.nickerson@navy.mil. In the event 
            of non-Federal Government contracts then state, local, or commercial contracts should be 
            evaluated in that order. Offerors shall ensure the past performance information requested is 
            submitted in the required timeframe or shall affirmatively state that it does not possess relevant 
            past performance information.
 In such cases, the offerors quote will be eliminated from the 
            competition. The Government reserves the right to contact previous customers and to obtain 
            additional past performance information as necessary to evaluate offerors past performance. The 
            assessment of the Offerors past performance will be used as a measure of performance risk for 
            this contract award. The assessment of the offers past performance will be used as a means of 
            evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the 
            requirements of this RFQ. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the 
            Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

            (c) PRICE - The contract resulting from this RFQ will be awarded to the responsible offeror 
            submitting a technically acceptable offer, having acceptable past performance, and the lowest 
            evaluated price.


             (d)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful     
                  offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without 
                  further action by either party.
 Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an 
                  offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of 
                  withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is SOL-NC-11-00027, and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-29.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990, which has a size standard of $7.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the development of an interactiv e mapping tool that allows a user to identify locations (areas) that are linked via hydrologic networks (Task 1).  The tool shall provide the ability to select/trace upstream and downstream areas for making estimates of the availability of ecosystem goods and services.  For example, user chooses a location of interest (a neighborhood, grid cells, watershed pour-point, etc.) and the tool identifies all upstream areas (wetlands, agriculture, pasturelands, forests, etc.) capable of producing selected ecosystem goods and services.  Conversely, the tool shall be capable of identifying all downstream areas of user-selected areas (wetlands, agriculture, pasturelands, forests, etc.) where ecosystem goods and services are delivered. Mapping tool shall run on a windows based operating system.  The mapping tools are for the region surrounding Tampa Bay but the tool development methods must be applicable for future development of connectivity networks in other areas of the US. Map layer s and networks shall be developed in ArcInfo or similar GIS software and organized in a geodatabase for easy access.  Mapping tools shall be web-based, possibly using a Google Earth interface and be open-source.  Required data layers must be freely available to the public. Meta-data shall be produced for all data layers.  Outputs from developed mapping tools shall be able to be exported into predictive and dynamic simulation models (Simile) so that landscape development and climate change scenarios can be assessed by EPA scientists.  Mapping tools shall have the ability for a user to modify landscapes to assess changes in ecosystem services.  Reports shall include approaches, methods, and select examples of results generated from the tools, as well as comprehensive user manuals.  Deliverables: Hydrologic Network Interactive Mapping Tool (Task One) ? 1) Report, associated network data sets, mapping tool and associated user manuals for current day (~2006) hydrologic connectivi ty of ecosystem services to people within the Tampa Bay drainage basin.  Report shall include:  Present day connectivity maps (30 x 30 m or higher resolution) identifying source and sink (benefit shed) areas for water-mediated ecosystem services flows to people within the Tampa Bay drainage basin.  Water connections shall include urban drainage infrastructure and pathways to aquifers and groundwater; Critical flow path gaps or disconnects between sources and sink areas; and an interactive mapping tool for hydrologic connectivity.  Applicable and Controlling Documents:  The contractor shall provide a written Quality Assurance Management Plan equivalent to the EPA?s requirement document [EPA Requirements for Quality Management Plans (QA/R-2)] and a written Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) equivalent to the EPA?s requirement document [EPA Requirements for QA Project Plans (QA/R-5)] for the Project Officer?s review and approval prior to commencement of work. These reference  documents can be located at http://www.epa.gov/quality/qa_docs.html.  The QAPP shall describe in detail all approaches, software, data storage, system requirements, etc. and all standard operating procedures used in the development of the tool.  There is an option for additional work for Tasks 2, 3, and 4.  Task Two: Once the hydrologic mapping tool has been developed, the contractor shall develop a transportation network mapping tool.  The tool shall provide the ability to map the accessibility of areas where ecosystem goods and services are produced to the proximity to transportation networks.  For example, user chooses a location of interest (a neighborhood, grid cells, watershed pour-point, etc.) and the tool reports the distance-weighted accessibility to areas (recreational spaces, farms, natural areas, etc.) producing selected ecosystem goods and services.  Conversely, the tool also shall be capable of reporting the distance-weighted availability of a selected locatio n to people through the transportation network.  Mapping tool shall run on a windows based operating system.  The mapping tools are for the region surrounding Tampa Bay but the tool development methods must be applicable for future development of connectivity networks in other areas of the US.Map layers and networks shall be developed in ArcInfo or similar GIS software and organized in a geodatabase for easy access.  Mapping tools shall be web-based, possibly using a Google Earth interface and be open-source.  Required data layers must be freely available to the public.  Meta-data shall be produced for all data layers.  Outputs from developed mapping tools shall be able to be exported into predictive and dynamic simulation models (Simile) so that landscape development and climate change scenarios can be assessed by EPA scientists.  Mapping tools shall have the ability for a user to modify landscapes to assess changes in ecosystem services.  Reports shall include approaches,  methods, and select examples of results generated from the tools, as well as comprehensive user manuals.  Deliverables:  Transportation Network Mapping Tool (Task 2) Report, associated network data sets, and mapping tool and associated user manuals for current day (~2006) transportation connectivity of ecosystem services to people within the Tampa Bay region.  Report shall include:  Present day transportation connectivity network connecting ecosystem service production areas with people (benefit shed) in the Tampa Bay region;  Definition of areas where people are relatively disconnected from access to ecosystem services production areas; Network gaps or bottlenecks where transportation connectivity could be improved; and Report on interactive mapping solution for the transportation network which includes all forms of transportation (e.g. foot traffic, bicycles, automobile, etc.) and should be detailed enough to assess people?s access to even the smallest of green spaces such  as a park or playground.  Task Three:   The Contractor shall develop an interactive mapping tool that allows a user to identify line-of-sight views to landscapes (?Viewsheds?) that influence human well-being.  The vista, or visually pleasing view, from any point on the landscape represents value that must be considered among other ecosystem goods and services.  Mapping tool shall run on a windows based operating system.  The mapping tools are for the region surrounding Tampa Bay but the tool development methods must be applicable for future development of connectivity networks in other areas of the US.  Map layers and networks shall be developed in ArcInfo or similar GIS software and organized in a geodatabase for easy access.  Mapping tools shall be web-based, possibly using a Google Earth interface and be open-source.  Required data layers must be freely available to the public.  Meta-data shall be produced for all data layers.   Outputs from developed mapping tools shall  be able to be exported into predictive and dynamic simulation models (Simile) so that landscape development and climate change scenarios can be assessed by EPA scientists.   Mapping tools shall have the ability for a user to modify landscapes to assess changes in ecosystem services.  Reports shall include approaches, methods, and select examples of results generated from the tools, as well as comprehensive user manuals.  Deliverables:  Viewshed Mapping Tool (Task 3)  Report on an approach for establishing the air-sheds, vistas of natural areas, and communication networks responsible for connecting human beneficiaries to ecosystem services production in the Tampa Bay drainage basin.  Task Four:  The Contractor shall develop a geospatially explicit interactive mapping tool that utilizes the aforementioned ecosystem functions, services, and landscape connectivity combined with valuation databases or results of primary valuation studies to derive areal based valuation estimates of the delivery of ecosystem goods and services to and from areas of stakeholder/client interest.  This will allow for visualization of specific services and their values in a user defined or predetermined geographic location and comparisons of those values between different locations and/or through time. The objective of this work is to determine the impacts of alternative policies, landscape changes, or climate effects on individual or bundled ecosystem goods and services over time.  These impacts should be presentable as changes in value associated with changes in the delivery of ecosystem services after accounting for non-linear relationships among ecosystem goods and services sup ply and demand, and cost benefit ratios related to the value hierarchy of beneficiaries which can also change over time.    Identify gaps and provide estimates of valuation data. Identify which ecosystem services are most sensitive to changes in policies, landscapes, and climate effects through time.  Develop a geospatial representation of the value of market and non-market ecosystem services now and into the future.  Deliverables:  Geospatially Explicit Interactive Mapping Tool (Task 4)  Report, associated network data sets, mapping tool, graphical user interface and associated user manuals on the value of ecosystem goods and services for the Tampa Bay region.  Report shall include:  Geospatially explicit, integrated, interactive web-ready mapping tool; Valuation of ecosystem goods and services in user defined locations; Graphical user interface for providing alternative policy driven variable coefficients and the user group?s value hierarchy as input to an ecosystem goods  and services production and valuation dynamic simulation model; and customized client driven reporting ability.

<p>COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />.372.3695</p>
<p>Closing date/time for submission of quotations is 12 Jul 2011 at 12:00PM, Pacific Time. Ensure that in addition to prices, quotes include applicable representations and certifications and all other information required by above incorporated clauses. Submit responses to SFLC CPD C&amp;PD 2 LRE, 1301 Clay Street, Suite 807N, Oakland, CA 94612, Attn: Marilou Ponge. Electronic offers submitted via FAX to (510) 637-5978 or by email to Marilou.M.Ponge@uscg.mil are acceptable and encouraged*****</p>

     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

						CERTIFICATION
     The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--
     (1) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;
     (2) The contract services are furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices. An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. An "established market price" is a current price, established in the usual course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror;
     (3) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
     (4) The offeror uses the same compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract as the offeror uses for these employees and for equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
   (b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Act--
     (1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or
     (2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis.
   (c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision--
     (1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and
     (2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation.
   (d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.

                              (End of Clause)
 
 C.5  VAAR 852.237-70 CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES (APR 1984)

Further, it is agreed that any negligence of the Government, its officers, agents, servants and employees, shall not be the responsibility of the contractor hereunder with the regard to any claims, loss, damage, injury, and liability resulting there from.

 C.7  VAAR 852.273-76 ELECTRONIC INVOICE SUBMISSION (Interim - October 2008)

At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor.

   (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
 
 Technical - compliance with content requirements as demonstrated in sample copy deliverable

   Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.
   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

       (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.  For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.
 
   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
 
     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--

     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
 
     [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

       (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

       (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
 
       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
 
     (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
     (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.
 
     (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
 
       [  ] TIN:  _____________________.
 
       [  ] TIN has been applied for.
 
       [  ] TIN is not required because:

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI's goal for its engagement in Zimbabwe is increased participation of Zimbabwe's citizens in the processes of and/or benefit from the principles set forth in the September 15, 2008 Global Political Agreement (GPA). By linking national political processes to grassroots communities, OTI is working to increase participation and ownership of the transition. Activities focus on increasing innovative methods of information dissemination; advancing key legislative reforms; developing protection strategies for politically vulnerable communities and social messaging targeted at youth regarding peaceful participation in democratic processes and nonviolence.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Stethoscopes. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single award for this standardization initiative.
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is November 2011</strong>. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. Point of Contact: Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Wendy Sprouse, Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse.ctr@us.army.mil. 808-433-3686. <br /></strong>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Stethoscopes. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,877,811.35. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, 138 line items of the total 185 line items represent the top three (3) products and account for 98.68% ($1,853,047.88) of the total volume in sales of $1,877,811.35 in the MMESOs, and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 3 product lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.<br />C. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Wendy Sprouse, Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse.ctr@us.army.mil. 808-433-3686. The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Pacific via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendors who do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. <br /></strong>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The <strong>four (4)</strong> requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date indicated. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br /></strong><em><strong>1. Vendor MUST provide a complete line of: Reusable Stethoscopes, that are latex-free, light-weight, single or double tubing design, contoured chest piece with non-chill rim, and self-sealing ear tips, with either a "diaphragm and bell" design or a "large diaphragm/small diaphragm" design and will include at a minimum, the specific products listed below: <br /></strong></em>a. <br />Required Items<br />STETHOSCOPE ADULT DUAL HEAD DIAPHRAGM / BELL OR LARGE DIAPHRAGM / SMALL DIAPHRAGM<br />STETHOSCOPE ADULT SINGLE HEAD DIAPHRAGM<br />STETHOSCOPE PEDIATRIC/ INFANT DUAL HEAD DIAPHRAGM / BELL<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Stethoscopes.</p>
<p>b. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufacture and/or distribute by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFIAQ with initial submittal. A vendor is required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type. <br />c. Vendor should indicate their ability to supply a Sprague-Rappaport-like stethoscope which includes interchangeable chest pieces. Inability to supply this product will not eliminate vendors from this standardization effort.</p>
<p>2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Stethoscopes. Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal. <br />3. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Stethoscopes or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal<br />4. Vendor MUST submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. <br />Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Selection Process <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Pacific, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given <strong>30 calendar days</strong> from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESOs Pacific and South via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) AND to the rest of the continental United States by appropriate delivery method when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. Vendor must send the MMESO Pacific verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Samples will not be returned). Two (2) samples of each of the stethoscopes listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.<br />Sample Set<br />STETHOSCOPE ADULT DUAL HEAD DIAPHRAGM/BELL<br />STETHOSCOPE PEDIATRIC DUAL HEAD DIAPHRAGM/ BELL</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate each Stethoscope product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line in a clinical/patient care setting. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) - Completely Unacceptable, two (2) - Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) - Partially Unacceptable, four (4) - Acceptable, and five (5) - Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. <strong>Clinical Requirement #5 will be double weighted. </strong></p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this <br />standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on<br />best price. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical <br />/performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one <br />score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be <br />combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability <br />evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Pacific and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for <br />final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately eighteen (18) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below: Of note, the clinical/performance requirements are not equally weighted, with clinical requirement #5 (Sound/Acoustical Performance of Device) being double-weighted.</p>
<p>1. (American Heart Association recommendation) (Ergonomics and Clinician Comfort) (Efficiency of Care) The binaurals (the metal portion of the stethoscope onto which the tubing and ear tips are fitted) should be adjustable. This provides comfort and appropriate fit for the clinician, allowing for a more thorough examination. The adjustability of the binaural is important to the comfort and appropriate fit for the clinician, allowing for a more thorough examination.</p>
<p>2. (Ease of Use and Effectiveness) (Patient Safety/Comfort - NPSG 07.05.01) The stethoscope should have a contoured chest piece so as to provide ease of handling and less slippage. A contoured chest piece allows for greater surface area coverage of the patient's skin, which contributes to better contact, as well as less slippage or sliding of the chest piece against the patient's skin.</p>
<p>3. (Effectiveness &amp; Efficiency of Care) (Device Performance, Medical device Quality Management ISO 13485:2003) The stethoscope should not allow any air leakage from between the diaphragm and the examiner's ears. Any air leakage may interfere with clarity and accuracy of interpretation of sounds.</p>
<p>4. (Device Performance, Medical device Quality Management ISO 13485:2003)<br />The ear tips should be self-sealing and fit securely in the ear/ear canal, reducing ambient noise. Self-sealing ear tips tend to seal against the listener's ear canal to block ambient noise, allowing for more accurate interpretation of sounds.</p>
<p>5. (Double Weighted) (Sound/Acoustical Performance of Device) The stethoscope should provide clarity (the ability to distinguish diagnostic cardiac sounds such as vascular clicks) and loudness (perceived amplitude of the sound), while filtering out noise artifacts (external noise interference). Enhanced clarity and loudness, without external noise interference allows for more accurate interpretation of sounds, which leads to more accurate diagnosis and patient treatment.</p>
<p>6. (Efficiency of Care/Patient Comfort/Safety NPSG.07.05.01) Auscultation of the patient should be able to be accomplished without causing any discomfort or chilling to the patient. The non-chill rim of the stethoscope chest piece prevents patient discomfort during the examination process.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given <strong>30 calendar days</strong> from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Pacific and must be received by 5:00 PM HST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</span></strong></p>

<p>PROGRAM SUMMARY: The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) advises the President, Secretary of State, other bureaus in the Department of State, and other departments and agencies within the U.S. Government on the development of policies and programs to combat international narcotics and crime.</p>
<p>One of INL's major goals is the enhancement of the professionalism of foreign criminal justice officials to enable them to efficiently combat crime in their respective countries and, at the same time, prevent the movement of transnational criminal elements into the United States and throughout the world. An effective and efficient way to accomplish this goal was the creation of an ILEA providing training to a global student body. In furtherance of this effort the Department of State established an International Law Enforcement Academy located in Roswell, New Mexico. The ILEA in Roswell became operational in 2001. The Academy has a dedicated campus facility with two training rooms, a series of small break-out rooms, administrative offices, a computer lab, and office space for instructors.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide facility management and maintenance for the ILEA Roswell facility in Roswell, NM. The contractor shall also provide delegation logistical support for international students attending the ILEA Roswell training program in Roswell, NM. INL plans to host approximately 400 - 500 foreign government officials per year, multiple weeks at a time, as participants in various Department of State foreign policy and technical outreach training programs.</p>
<p>The contractor will coordinate all activities - facility and international delegations logistics - with the ILEA training facilitator to support the overall ILEA training program.</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Government is conducting a single source selection under this solicitation and intends to award one (1) contract by conducting a 100% HUBZone set-aside competition in accordance with FAR Part 15. We anticipate a one year contract with four one-year options which the Government reserves the right to unilaterally exercise any or all one-year options (IAW FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract).</p>

1.	Regarding tungsten projectiles.  Additional information is requested regarding the type and amount of tungsten projectiles or projectile fragments expected, and of the physical form of the residue (solid or a fine powder).   The statement regarding "use of HEPA vacuums to remove excess rubber from tungsten projectiles" requires additional clarification.
Response:  The type of ammunition that is used by the LETC is as follows:
Training Ammunition-LL9MM2, Bullet type is copper jacket, lead core, 124 grain.
Training Ammunition Frangible- FE9MM, Bullet type is brass jacketed-compressed iron core frangible, 101 grain.
Duty Ammunition-GS9MMB-Ammo Centerfire, Bullet Type is brass jacketed hollow point, 125 grain.
The same MSDS covers the regular ball full metal case training and brass jacketed hollow point.  A separate MSDS covers the frangible training ammunition.  The MSDS sheets can be provided upon request.

1440			<1.00			6.94	<6.94
HEPA vacuuming is preferred by the LETC.
2.	Regarding bullet residue recycling, is it the responsibility of the contractor to locate a metals recycling facility that will accept lead bullet material, or does VA have such a recycling contractor in place?  Who will receive the monetary proceeds of sale to the recycling facility - VA-LETC or the cleaning contractor?  Also, is there an estimate available of the expected recoverable mass of lead bullet residue?
Response: The spent brass is put into 55 gallon drums and processed through a coordinator at the VA Medical Center, however for the other waste generated from mining the range; LETC does not have a recycling contractor in place.  In previous years the contractor that mined the range subcontracted with the recycler.  The VA LETC has not received any monetary proceeds of sale to any recycling facilities in the past.  The waste that was recycled from mining the range in 2010 consisted of the following:
One (1) Gaylord box of waste (lead contaminated rags)
Hazardous waste solid N.O.S., 9NA3077, PG111 (Contains Lead) EDG#171-1 container. (Container type - PT), (Total Quantity- 0250) (Unit Weight Involved - p)
3.	Regarding the 15 gum rubber curtains, has laboratory hazardous waste characterization been previously performed to verify that these curtains meet hazardous waste criteria  for metals (TCLP), or is it the responsibility of the cleaning contractor to perform such characterization testing? 
Response: It is the responsibility of the contractor to perform characterization testing.
4.	What is the aggregate mass of the 15 gum rubber curtains? Is the cleaning contractor responsible for including the estimated cost of disposal of these curtains and other materials as hazardous waste? 
Response: Covered under question #2.
5.	Provide more data is required about the range structure itself, such as the building dimensions, numbers and sizes of openings for building access, wall and flooring materials (e.g., brick, concrete block, concrete, etc.), extent of utilities available (electricity and water) and any other features of the range's structure and location that would limit access or impede cleaning operations.
Response: The size of the range is 54'8" wide and 110'3" long.  There are 15 firing lanes.
The range is concrete block construction with wood covered steel plating overhead baffles of firing area, with open interstitial space between them.  There are electrical outlets behind the firing line and access to a bathroom outside the range but no water utilities other than a wash basin in the cleaning room and armory.  There is a single access door to the area behind the impact area and access to the range from the parking area is accessible through 4 sets of double doors allowing large equipment and/or carts.  Lane number 1 and lane number 15 have a wider opening to get forward of the firing line.
6.	Will there be an opportunity provided for prospective contractors to make an on-site visit prior to bid submission?
Response:  On site visit allowable- all site visits shall be completed no later than July 8, 2011.  Vendors may contact the Contracting Officer, Robin Matteson, to request an on-site visit, one per vendor.  Visits will be non-reimbursable, at the sole expense of the vendor.  All site visits must be completed prior to July 8, 2011.

7.	Can pictures of the trap as it exists and/or plans illustrating the configuration of the range with the Gran Trap installed and/or dimensions and locations of access to the trap/range be provided?  
Response:  Pictures of trap will be provided upon request to Contracting Officer, Robin Matteson.  Emails must be submitted prior to July 7, 2011. The bullet trap area is a stepped metal trap area. Viewing from the side, it would look like steps. It's approx ten feet tall and has openings at the top where the rubber chunk impact media can be dumped into. It has the large rubber mats laid over the sloped impact media. 

8.	Are there showers/toilets available within the facility for use by cleaning personnel?
Response:  The closest bathroom will be outside of the range next to the cleaning room and range entrance. It's a single restroom with a toilet and sink. Previous vendors had a little decon changing room they set up after the entrance onto the range where they put on and took off their protective clothing and equipment. Shower facilities have not historically been requested.

9.	Last provider of service?
Response:  Best Technology Systems, Inc.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) will issue a solicitation for SITE CHARACTERIZATION (ASSESSMENT) AND REMEDIATION OF LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS (LUSTs) IN INDIAN COUNTRY, which will support the mission of the Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) within the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER).  This action is set-aside as an 8(a) competitive solicitation in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.8.  Only SBA certified 8(a) firms may apply.  Offers from other than 8(a) certified firms will not be considered.  This procurement aims to ensure that leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs) in the United States do not pose a threat to human health and the environment.  The background, goals, policies and statutes relevant to the Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) program can be accessed via the Internet at the following web address: http://www.epa.gov/OUST.  OUST, in partnership with EPA's regional offices, implements the LUST program in Indian Country, and provides technical support to clean up petroleum releases from USTs.
The general types of support functions the Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) shall require with this procurement include, but are not limited to: evaluating sites for  LUST-eligibility; conducting site assessments (e.g., testing tanks for leaks when a leak is suspected, investigating a site to evaluate the source and extent of petroleum contamination); remediating contaminated sites;  providing technical field assistance to EPA for enforcement responsibilities; and providing outreach materials to assist with cleaning up petroleum releases from underground storage tanks, primarily in Indian Country, throughout the United States.  This is a follow-on effort to expiring Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts, EP-W-07-104, that currently supports OUST; and two expiring CPFF contracts, EP-W-08-072 and EP-W-08-073, which currently support the Region 8 LUST program.   EPA anticipates awarding one hybrid (T&M/FFP) IDIQ contract to support this requirement with a two (2) year base period, three (3) 12-month option periods, and two (2) 12-month award periods, for a maximum performance potential of seven (7) years. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this procurement is 562910 - Environmental Remediation Services with a size standard of 500 employees.  EPA intends to obtain proposals through a competitive procurement process using FAR Part 15 procedures.  Award will be made to the responsible 8(a) contractor whose proposal represents best value to the Government.  The solicitation and all information pertaining to this procurement will be available on or around July 12, 2011, at EPA's "Business Opportunities with EPA" Internet World Wide Website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/index.htm.  
Information related to this procurement including any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted here on the Federal Business Opportunities website at: www.fbo.gov and the EPA website at: http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/lasc/LUSTs/index.htm. 
THE EPA WILL NOT ISSUE A PAPER SOLICITATION. If you have any questions regarding this notice please contact (by email only) the Contract Specialist.  No facsimile or telephonic responses will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to support the U.S. Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey. The project is for exhaust, ventilation, architectural &amp; structural upgrades and repairs to an Armament Technology Facility consisting of replacing and upgrading the ventilation systems for the 100 m range, 300 m range, water trap area and associated preparation and testing areas. The ventilation system has been designed to increase the efficiency of the exhaust system to move the dust created by weapons testing out of the firing area. In addition to this ventilation upgrade, the project consists of architectural, structural, and acoustical improvements such as the installation of new blast rated acoustical doors, new acoustical enclosures, and new sally-ports for air equalization between the range and industrial areas. The ranges and water trap area are reinforced concrete structures with complex heating and ventilation systems, lighting, power, communications (copper and fiber) and membrane roofing attached to the existing laboratory building. The laboratory building, which includes test preparation areas and administrative space is a predominately concrete-reinforced structure single-story, building constructed on a reinforced concrete foundation, EDPM roofing, complete with plumbing, HVAC, Industrial Ventilation Systems, lighting, power and communications (copper and fiber).<br /><br />Acoustical panels and barriers will be added for sound mitigation. The facility incorporates the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers TI 800-01 Design Criteria, the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-600-01, and the latest adopted federal, state, and local code requirements (i.e., NFPA, NSPC, NIOSH, OSHA, etc.), in addition to the USACE and other government standards listed for this project. The contractor is required to obtain a Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Permit for this work. Air Permits are required for the installation of several pieces of combustion equipment (mechanical equipment), that have a heat input rate of 1,000,000 BTU per hour or greater to the burning chamber. The proposed equipment in the Mechanical Section exceeds the 1,000,000 BTU per hour threshold and will require the project to obtain an Air Permit. This project will require selective demolition/removals, including existing HVAC/Industrial Ventilation equipment and ductwork, electrical equipment, doors, etc. Removed materials will need to be properly handled and disposed of or recycled. The lead abatement specification prepared specifically for this project to include work in areas considered lead-contaminated including: range firing areas/tunnels, water trap areas, and all exhaust ductwork (interior contaminated with lead dust). This project will require removal of the existing lead-contaminated HVAC/Industrial Ventilation ductwork and building materials. Contaminated material will need to be properly handled and disposed of. The contractor is required to provide a lead disposal/abatement plan which includes disposal plans prior to commencement of work. This project does not include work on the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) except for removal work. The Army's Security Vendor for Building 7 (currently DRS) is responsible for re-installation of the existing IDS system at new and replaced door locations. The Contracting Officer Representative will coordinate this new IDS work with the Contractor and with the Army's Security Vendor. Existing site is partially paved and may require removal of VOC.

<DESC>The anticipated release date of the request for proposal (RFP) is on, or about, July 15, 2011.<br><br>W911W5-11-R-0010 EWIR<br>Presolicitation Questions and Answers<br>1. Will there be an industry day at NGIC for vendors to meet face-face with the customer?<br>1 A: There will not be an industry day.<br>2. Under this IDIQ effort, is it expected that the bulk of the work is to be performed at NGIC or if it acceptable that the work will be performed off-site (we have SCIFs in our facility)?<br>2 A: The primary place of performance is anticipated to be the contractor's facility, within 50 miles of the NGIC, 2055 Boulders Road, Charlottesville, VA 22911 and the secondary place of performance is anticipated to be on-site at workstations at the NGIC.<br>3. Will the solicitation have a small business requirement?<br>3 A: It is anticipated that the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, will be included in the solicitation, and subsequent contract, for this requirement, since the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.<br>4. Will there be a requirement for bidders to have facilities cleared for processing and handling of SECRET material in the Charlottesville area?<br>4 A: It is anticipated that facilities and safeguarding measures cleared to SECRET will be required, within 50 miles of the NGIC, 2055 Boulders Road, Charlottesville, VA 22911.<br>5. Where is the anticipated Place of Performance for this effort?<br>5 A: The primary place of performance is anticipated to be the contractor's facility, within 50 miles of the NGIC, 2055 Boulders Road, Charlottesville, VA 22911 and the secondary place of performance is anticipated to be on-site at workstations at the NGIC.<br>6. Will there be a requirement for the proposal to be delivered in hardcopy, or will delivery on CDs be acceptable? If hardcopy is required, can supplemental information be provided in softcopy?<br>6 A: It is anticipated that proposals should be submitted in soft copy. Any classified portions of offerors' proposals can also be submitted in soft copy delivered on CDs through the appropriate channels. Further guidance on this subject will be provided in the solicitation.<br>7. Will delivery of the classified response to the sample Task Order be allowed by courier?<br>7 A: Yes.<br>8. Will contractors be allowed to employ additional open source material in generating their response to the sample Task Order, or will it be limited to the information provided?<br>8 A: No. In responding to the sample task order, offerors will be directed to use the classified information NGIC will provide. Use of any other materials, whether classified or from open sources, in preparing a response to the sample task order could introduce errors that would more than likely lower the evaluation rating of the offeror's response.<br>9. Will the sample Task Order require production of a Legacy EWIR or Next Generation EWIR system file as part of the response?<br>9 A: No. Offerors' proposals should address the work and costs involved in producing EWIR products for the sample task order, but offerors should NOT actually create or submit Legacy EWIRDB or Next Generation EWIRDB System products as part of an offeror's response.<br>10. I am hoping that you are confident that funding will be forthcoming?<br>10 A: Funding is available for this requirement.<br>11. Questions were asked about the previous contract for EWIR support.<br>11 A: The previous contract number was W911W4-05-D-0002. The contractor was Syracuse Research Corp and the total value was estimated to be $20,000,000.00.

<DESC>Sole Source Justification

The solicitation is for the HVAC Emergency Replacement Project on the Systems Administration Building located at the Quantico National Cemetery.  This solicitation is being Sole Sourced in accordance with PL 109-461 to Knighto, LLC.  

This is an urgent requirement because the current HVAC systems are both down and needs to be replaced.  They are currently using temporary systems for air conditioning in the building and it's not doing an effective job.  The plan is to replace both roof mounted HVAC systems.  

Given the time year, this project needs to be completed because we are going to be entering the height of the summer season in July and August.  If this project is not completed before the height of the summer season, there is a potential for customer and employee complaints along with an impact on worker productivity.

Sole Sourcing to a SDVOSB is in the best interest of the Government.

	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;


5.	Demonstration that the Contractors Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  Currently thirty (30) veterans from the Salisbury VAMC reside at the Charlotte Town Manor. A site inspection noted extensive safety violations. It was determined that the facility was no longer safe for housing the veterans. A search conducted to locate suitable facilities revealed four (4) facilities however Helton Manor was the only facility that could accommodate all the veterans immediately.  


6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  There are facilities in the local area that are able to provide housing and care for the veterans, however due to the emergent nature of this requirement it is necessary to use a facility that can accommodate  all of the veterans immediately.

In accordance with the criteria outlined in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2) (ii) The Contracting Officer has determined that this price compared to previous contract prices and industry standard to be fair and reasonable. Price reasonableness was based on contract            (VA246-P-0584) by comparing all quotes received and the area standard rate of $105 a day per Veteran.
The cost to the government is expected to be $70 a day per Veteran which is considered fair and reasonable compared to the standard rates.


8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was conducted on April 26, 2011 and the Contracting Officer contends there are other facilities that can accommodate the veterans, however as stated in Paragraph 6 due to the emergent nature of the request, and the need for all thirty (30) Veterans to be at the same facility Helton Manor is the only facility that can accomplish this immediately.


9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  As stated in above paragraph 8 due to the emergent nature of this requirement, and the ability of Helton Manor  to provide immediate housing; it is not in the best interest to the Government to solicit for full and open competition.


10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See paragraph 8


11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Due to the emergent nature of this action there was no time to promote competition.

<DESC>Modification to extend the current Delivery Order (DO) under the STRICOM Omnibus Contract (STOC), W900KK-07-D-0723 DO # 0001, with Raydon Corporation (Raydon).  Pursuant to FAR Section 16.505(b)(2)(iii), this memorandum documents the reason for PEO STRI's exception to the requirement to provide awardees a fair opportunity for consideration of an effort to be performed under an indefinite delivery contract. This DO will utilize FY11 OMA funding for the base period and FY12 OMA funding for the option period.  The Period of Performance (POP) for training is desired to commence on 15 Jul 2011 and will consist of a six month base period with a six month option for the Route Clearance Training Services (RCTS) Phase I supporting United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Combat Engineer units.
