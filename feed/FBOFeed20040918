<DESC>DESC: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested. Solicitation No. 201814Q040 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) and will be awarded as a Purchase Order using simplified acquisition procedures.  The NAICS Code 512110. The size standard is 25,000,000 employees. The solicitation document, incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24(a). BACKGROUND: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 2, Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, Roswell, New Mexico requires the following filming and production of habitats and inhabitants during various times of the year for use as an educational video in our visitor center.

Many find a landscape that is a challenge to appreciate and understand.  The natural wonders that are spread before them in this arid place are difficult to see with human eyes in a short time.  "Oasis in the Desert" will use lenses and motion to take the visitor into mysterious underwater and wetland habitats where they cannot go themselves.  It will use images and editing to guide the visitor through the seasons that they haven't the time to experience in person.  It will present an array of beautiful and fascinating species and behaviors that cannot be seen up close in a single day by even the most determined naturalist.  With the use of macro lenses, periscope lenses, and underwater cameras, filming will provide surprising transitions from the arid landscape.  Custom built tanks and macro lenses will allow intimate looks at unexpected desert organisms.  We will need at least four filming visits to the refuge to capture images and sounds of spring bird migration and fall migration.  These shots will allow the film to explain how the water that shapes this unusual landscape flows and is captured.  Much of the wildlife and natural diversity of the Bitter Lake NWR is difficult or impossible to see clearly with human eyes.  It is elusive, or underwater, or living in places that are unreachable by visitors.  We need filming with macro and telephoto lenses and with high speed or time-lapse cameras.  Montages will gather many of these carefully filmed wildlife images to make the word "diversity" meaningful. The provision at FAR 52.212-01, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, and FAR provision 52.212-02, Evaluation Commercial Items, are applicable to this acquisition, 52.212-03 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, the Clause at FAR 52.212-04, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, and the Clause at FAR 52.212-05, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.   All interested parties must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as prescribed in FAR 52.204-7.   Evaluation of Commercial Items: the Government will award to the responsible offeror who conforms to the solicitation and is considered most advantageous to the Government, based on 1. Price; and 2.  Technical.   FAR clauses can be accessed at the following websites: http://www.arnet.gov/far and http://www.doi.gov/pam/pamare. Vendors wishing to respond to this combined synopsis/RFP should provide this office with the following: price quote,  a completed copy of FAR Clause 52.212-03, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and a information sheet on equipment being quoted. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in the offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for the receipt of offers. Proposals are due no later than 3:30 p.m. (local time), October 29, 2004 and should be electronically submitted via e-mail to mary_drobot@fws.gov or mailed to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (CGS) 500 Gold Ave., SW, Room 5108, P.O.

C.1 The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires access for 15 users to congressional legislative information via a single web interface service on a subscription basis through the Internet. This service shall include the following information and capabilities, with updates daily or more frequent:

The Government intends to issue a purchase order for the services above to the responsible vendor whose quote conforms to the RFQ and is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors, which are in descending order of importance shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1-Technical Capability:  The SEC will evaluate the degree to which the quoter demonstrates an understanding of and meets the technical requirements of the solicitation. Factor 2-Corporate Experience:  The SEC will evaluate the quoter’s corporate experience in performing requirements that are similar in scope and size to the SEC’s requirements.  Factor 3-Past Performance:  The SEC will review the quoter’s past performance information in evaluating quoter’s ability to conform to contract requirements and adhere to contract schedules, commitment to customer satisfaction, and its demonstration of reasonable and cooperative behavior and business like concern for the interest of its customers (quoters shall provide complete client contact information so that reference checks may be conducted).  Factor 4-Price. Award will be made to the responsible quoter whose offer is considered to be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  Quoters shall submit one original and three copies of the Technical Quote and two copies of the Business Quote containing the information set forth above.  Any data previously submitted in response to another RFQ will be assumed unavailable to the Commission; and this data must not be incorporated in the quotation by reference.  The Technical Quote shall fully and adequately address specific requirements.  Statements in the form of “the quoter understands” or “the quoter shall comply” or “yes the quoter can provide” and statements that paraphrase the Statement of Work are inadequate.  If a vendor submits a Technical Quote in this format, the Technical Quote will be considered as non-responsive and no further action will be taken.  The Business Quote containing pricing shall be submitted in a separate volume from the Technical Quote. The Technical and Business Quotes shall be separate and complete so the evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of the other. Quoters shall also provide a copy of the Technical and Business Quotes on disk in Microsoft Office Compatible software.   This evaluation will be based on information provided by the vendor. The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the quotation, but may do so at its discretion.  Only authorized representatives shall submit quotes.  Please carefully review the commercial item clauses for information about the requirements and instructions for submitting a quotation.  The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement:  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offeror-Commercial Items (JAN 2004); FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999). FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (MAY 2004)- all quoters shall include a completed copy of this provision with their quote; FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Condition-Commercial Items (OCT 2003); FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (MAY 2004)- in paragraph (b) the following clauses apply: 52.203-6 Alternate I, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-41, 52.222-43, 52.222-44, 52.232-33, 52.232-36, and 52.239-1.  Clauses incorporated by reference may access in full text at www.arnet.gov.  All quotes from responsible sources will be considered.  All quotes shall be submitted via U.S. mail to Rosetta Wright-Samuel, Procurement and Contracts Branch, 6432 General Green Way, Stop 0-20, Alexandria, VA.  22312 no later than 3:00 PM EST September 21, 2004.  Quotes shall be clearly marked RFQ No. SECHQ1-04-Q-0127.  No other method of submission will be accepted.  All questions concerning this RFQ shall be e-mail to Rosetta P. Wright-Samuel , samuelr@sec.gov no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on  September 17, 2004.  Questions will not be answered orally.
Amendment 0001:  Technical merit is considered to be more important than price; the importance of price will increase, however, as technical merit of the offers becomes more equal.  Among quotes that are substantially equal in technical merit, price may become the determinative factor for award; thus, the quotes offering the Commission the best value, technical and price factors considered, shall be considered for award.  The Contracting Officer may consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror when in the best interest of the Government.
