<DESC>Reference Previous Announcements:  Qualifications Requirements Posted 13 Jun 03, Reference Number 3110-03-3.  Pre-Synopsis, Posted 23 May 03, Reference Number 3110-03-2. Repair and/or refurbishment of engine bearings for use in the J69 engine (T-37 aircraft) and the J85 engine (T-39, A-37, F-5 aircraft).  The approximate response date is 14 Oct 2003.  The contractor shall provide all labor, facilities, equipment and all material to accomplish repair and/or refurbishment, packing, preservation and packaging. No Government Furnished Material, (GFM); only Contract Furnished Material  (CFM).  No Government Tooling provided. A Requirements Type, FFP contract, with a one year basic and four one-year options for all items.  Estimated Total Dollar is approximately $2 Million for the life of the contract.  Qualifications Requirements:  Sources must be qualified prior to being considered for award, in accordance with FAR 52.209-1.  Award will be made only if the offeror or the manufacturer meets qualifications requirements at the time of award.  Qualification Requirements were previously posted on FED BIZ OPS (see reference above). Solicitation will contain instructions for obtaining further information on this requirement. No Telephone Requests.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requester is acceptable.  All responsible sources solicited may submit a bid, proposal, or quote which if timely shall be considered.  
CRITICALITY: Many of these bearings are life-limited main engine bearings, which support the core turbo-machinery, i.e. the compressor and turbine rotors.  Non-conformances in the services provided by this contract are likely to cause extensive secondary damage and can cause loss of the weapon system and loss of life.  
COMPLEXITY:  The refurbishment services provided under this contract involve cleaning, inspection, disassembly, and reassembly of bearings, as well as honing, buffing/polishing of races and the replacement of separators (cages), rings and rolling elements.  The processes required are:  honing, noise detection, magnetic particle inspections, fluorescent penetrate inspection, demagnetization, buffing/polishing, plating and corrosion control cleaning/preservation.  These services require “clean” rooms, special equipment and a calibration facility.   These services are complex and require special quality controls.
RISK:  Because of the criticality and complexity described above, the risk to safety-of-flight and weapon system reliability may require pre-award qualification of all potential refurbishment sources.
NOTE:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<DESC>The Marine Corps intends to acquire Increment one of an Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS).   The EFSS will provide all-weather, ground-based, close supporting, accurate, immediately responsive, and lethal indirect fire support for the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  EFSS will be the principal indirect fire support weapon for Marine Expeditionary Units and vertical assault elements of a Ship-To-Objective Maneuver force. EFSS will be capable of successfully engaging a spectrum of potential point and area targets, including motorized, light armored, and dismounted personnel targets, command and control systems, and indirect fire systems.  The EFSS must be internally transportable by Marine Corps rotary wing and tilt rotor aircraft.  The EFSS must have sufficient cross-country mobility to provide continuous supporting fires in support of dismounted MAGTF operations.  Initial Operating Capability (IOC) is required in Government Fiscal Year 06.  Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) will follow an Evolutionary Acquisition and Spiral Development strategy to reduce cycle time and speed delivery of the initial capability.  


The key performance parameters include: unassisted indirect fire maximum range for a standard high explosive (HE) projectile shall be no less than 7 kilometers (threshold), 14 kilometers (objective);  shall be capable of achieving a Range Error, Probable (PEr) of 0.6% of range and a Deflection Error, probable (PEd) of 0.6% of range at 66% of maximum range (threshold), a PEr of 0.3% and PEd of 0.1% (objective.); shall be internally transportable 110 nautical miles (nm) by both the MV-22 and CH-53E, (threshold = objective); shall be capable of exchanging information with a Fire Direction Center (FDC) by voice (threshold), by voice and data (objective).

MCSC is issuing a draft RFP on 01 December 2003.  The draft RFP will contain several contract line items that will span the gamut of contract types from Cost Plus Award Fee to Firm Fixed Price, depending upon the nature of the goods or services being provided against that line item.
The purpose of the draft RFP is to provide the potential offerors an opportunity to comment on all aspects of the solicitation.  Potential offerors are invited to comment on all sections of the solicitation including the contract types, the line item structure, the statement of work, the general and special provisions and any other sections of the draft solicitation that they believe would achieve a cost effective solution to the Marine Corps need described above.

The draft RFP can be viewed on the MARCORSYSCOM website at www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/ctq/efss.asp.  Questions and comments should be submitted in writing to mailto:EFSSRFP@MCSC.USMC.MIL.

Once the industry comments have been assimilated the USMC will hold an open meeting with industry and release a final RFP shortly thereafter.  The meeting with industry is planned for on or about January 15, 2004.  The anticipated date for release of the final RFP is on or about January 23, 2004.

The objective of this process is to verify that the life support system provides acceptable levels of diver safety throughout the specified operating range when approved operating and maintenance procedures are fo llowed.  The intent of the process is to provide maximum reasonable assurance that an accident will not occur and establishes maximum reasonable assurance that the diver or firefighter may be recovered without injury if there is an accident. DP Enterprises is the only source available that is certified to complete the hose assemblies. FSC Code: 4720 NAICS:	332999 SBA Size Standard: 500 employees

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Urologic Oncology Branch (UOB), plans to procure two, second year urology residence to perform services and support from Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, 2115 Wisconsin Avenue Suite 108, Washington, D.C., 20007.  The services and supplies herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 622110 and the business size standard is $29M.  The urologic surgery program at the National Cancer Institute evaluates patients with known or suspected urologic cancer and manages a large number of patients with hereditary forms of cancers of the kidney and other organs.  These patients are evaluated in the Clinical Center of the NIH and are entered into clinical trials involving medical as well as surgical therapy.  NCI has a need for second year urological surgery residents in approved training programs to see the patients, manage them in the clinic as inpatients and in the operating room under the guidance of an NCI urological surgery attending surgeon.  The NCI urologic surgery program is also responsible for all urologic care at the Clinical Center, NIH.  Second year urological surgical residents have the unique skills, training, and education required to evaluate and manage patients with urologic disorders at the NCI.  It is important that the residents be from a urologic surgery program that is less than one hour from NIH and that the urology program that they are from be approved by the Residency Review Committee (RRC) for this activity.  The residents must be in an RRC-approved residency program and the RRC must have approved this activity.  This is important for the educational mission of the Urologic Oncology Branch and for the Urologic Oncology Fellowship program at the NCI.  Physicians at the Urologic Oncology Branch, CCR, NCI have had a long standing relationship and are conducting joint collaborative studies with physicians from the Division of Urology at the Georgetown University Medical Center. The physicians need to be residents in urologic surgery and have at lease one year of urological surgical training experience.  Residents must be able to manage patients with complex urologic disorders before surgery, in the operating room and after surgery in the post-operative period.  They also must be able to manage critical urological surgical emergencies in pre and post-operative patients.  These physicians shall provide urologic medical care for the Urologic Oncology Branch (UOB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH).  Contractor shall provide liability insurance for the resident physicians.  The urology residents shall not be covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act.  Period of Performance: Upon award through 12 months, with four (4) option year periods.  The contractor shall provide two second year urology residents for the period of six (6) months each, January 1 - June 30 and July 1 - December 31 during each calendar year. Georgetown University Medical Center is the only known source that can provide two second year residents to perform the aforementioned services.  Georgetown is also the only known University Urology Department who can send urological surgical second year residents to NCI for 12 months who are approved for this activity by the Urologic Surgery Residency Review Committee.  It is also important to have highly skilled surgeons from a program such as Georgetown that has high clinical standards who can provide outstanding surgical and medical care to the patient population at NCI.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington DC time) on December 16, 2003.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, e-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Water Management, Irrigation, and Land Reclamation Implementation Plan-- Uzbekistan  :  The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for a Water Management, Irrigation, and Land Reclamation Implementation Plan in Uzbekistan.

Irrigation has been practiced in Uzbekistan since ancient times, mainly adjacent to the major rivers and in desert oases.  Russian occupation in the late-19th century saw the beginnings of modern canal irrigation, which gradually expanded in the first half of the 20th century, during which time the country’s comparative advantage in growing cotton became apparent.  In the 1950s, Soviet planners seized the opportunity to make their country self-sufficient in cotton and carried out a series of major new irrigation projects (together with major storage reservoirs and construction of numerous pumping stations) in Uzbekistan and neighboring Republics.  While these projects were successful in boosting cotton output and providing employment for a fast growing population, they had a number of side effects, which were only partly foreseen.

Central Asia is drained by two major rivers, the Syr Darya in the north and Amu Darya in the south, that arise in the mountains and flow across desert lands to the Aral Sea – once the fourth largest freshwater lake in the world.  Intensive irrigation development since 1960 has drastically reduced the flow of the two rivers and their inflow to the Aral Sea, which has consequently shrunk drastically.  The formerly productive deltas of the two rivers have largely reverted to desert.  Irrigation development has also raised water tables and increased the mobilization of salt from the soil profile, adding increasing amounts of salt to the river system and Aral Sea, to the extent that the future sustainability of irrigation is threatened.

With support from international donors, the International Fund for the Aral Sea is completing a Water and Environmental Management Project, which has as its centerpiece development of a Regional Water and Salt Management Strategy, together with national strategies for each of the five Central Asian states, including Uzbekistan.  These national strategies are expected to be compatible with the regional one, that is, they should recognize that the shared water resources are finite (and already nearly fully developed).  

Once Uzbekistan has adopted its National Water and Salt Management Strategy (Strategy), many potential investment needs will open up but the constraints to future development will also become more apparent.  Thus, the emphasis will need to be on better management of existing resources, pointing to improving the efficiency of water use, decreasing salt mobilization and improving salt disposal, providing incentives to the private sector – notably the farmers themselves – to undertake investments in rehabilitation and modernization, and improving the effectiveness of the irrigation agencies.

MAWR is responsible for the provision of agricultural services, including irrigation, to the nation’s farmers.  MAWR’s water management responsibilities have hardly changed in the past decade while staff numbers have been halved and its budget has been greatly reduced in real terms.  Its response has been to eliminate nearly all capital investment and limit maintenance to the most urgently needed repairs.  While the irrigation systems are, by and large, still operating, water delivery is irregular and the backlog of deferred maintenance means that the day is approaching when large areas will cease to function.  This is particularly true for the 50% of the irrigated land that depends on pumping, where loss of one key piece of equipment could shut down the entire system.  

In order to meet these challenges, MAWR’s Water Department is reorganizing itself along river sub-basin lines rather then by administrative region.  This will result in 10 sub-basin divisions rather than the 12 regional branches and 145 district sub-branches that now exist.  MAWR is also promoting the establishment of Water User Associations (WUAs), which will have the responsibility of operating and managing the tertiary-level irrigation and drainage systems.  This will involve the imposition of some form of water delivery fee to be assessed and collected by the WUAs, eventually covering their full operating costs.  

The adoption of the Implementation Plan would help build capacity within MAWR to address the budgetary, planning, and implementation issues necessary to make commercial development in this sector viable.  The Implementation Plan would help operationalize the Strategy that Uzbekistan has adopted.  

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $545,410 grant to the MAWR from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.

Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.  All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition.  If your concerns are not satisfied by the contracting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman, Kathy Cames, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at (478) 926-2604.  Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.  This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military space application.

US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation.  To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN:  DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number.

MOU country sources must contact the contracting officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued.  Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

Will one be issued after industry input is received or is this an effort to build a performance specification ? A2.  Industry input will be used to assist with the development of a user-defined, operationally-based performance criteria and the test & evaluation methodology for a special lubricant for desert environments.  Candidate lubricants will be evaluated again st this performance criteria.     Q3.  Is the lubricant going to be evaluated as to it's performance in the desert environment only, or should the lubricant also perform in a wet environment. A3.  The user-defined operationally-based performance criteria will contain the specific environments for which it applies.  Currently, the user is focusing on the desert environments only.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop technical assistance for capacity building in the telecommunications sector of Peru.

This Technical Assistance is designed to help Organismo Supervisor de Inversión Privada en Telecomunicaciones (OSIPTEL), the telecommunications regulatory agency of Peru, address weaknesses in the current regulatory regime, as follows: overall fixed-line and wireless teledensity remains low; marginal-urban areas have been neglected; and the market continues to be dominated by the previously state-owned incumbent. In addition, OSIPTEL has expressed concerns regarding barriers to entry, service pricing, and their ability to oversee and manage the industry.

The Technical Assistance will focus on assessing the conditions and level of competition of local, long-distance, wireless, and international telecom service, as well as cable television service; assessing the current role of the regulator (OSIPTEL) and providing OSIPTEL with comparable analyses of other entities and similar telecommunications markets; and assisting OSIPTEL with a strategic plan for improving their current functions, including specific training and capacity building of their staff.

The Terms of Reference for the Technical Assistance include the following tasks: 1) a survey of state of the market and competition; 2) an analysis of the regulatory environment; 3) a review and analysis of pricing/tariffing schemes and mechanisms; 4) an identification of the implications for marginal-urban and rural telecommunications development; 5) the preparation of a draft policy document; 6) a review to strengthen OSIPTEL's supervision and oversight capabilities; 7) the organization of in-country workshops, and; 8) the preparation of draft and final reports and the presentation of findings.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $325,830 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFP's received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service (USPS) is currently providing stamp vending services to customers in a reliable, easily accessed, and cost effective manner via postal lobbies and other high traffic areas such as museum lobbies.  However the USPS would like to provide this same service at a lower cost while maintaining or improving current levels of service.  As such the USPS is requesting information for the servicing, cleaning, replenishing and maintaining of stamp vending equipment in selected postal and non-postal facilities.  The supplier will also be required to collect cash, make bank deposits, be responsible for refund payments, and maintain and relocate equipment per USPS instructions.  

As part of this information seeking process the USPS has issued an RFI (Request for Information), which will be followed by an evaluation of that information by the USPS.  Suppliers that satisfy this evaluation process may be expected to engage in discussions with representatives from the USPS.  Final evaluation will occur based upon all information collected.  The USPS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to pay for the information requested. 

A Pre-RFI Response Conference will be held on December 18, 2003 at USPS offices in Aurora CO.  The purpose of this conference is to allow potential suppliers to meet with USPS representatives and to ask questions.  Final proposals are due by 4:00 p.m. MT on January 14, 2004.  Interested suppliers may request a RFI package via e-mail to katherine.m.deford@usps.gov or kathleen.hamilton@usps.gov.  No telephone inquiries will be entertained.

<SUBJECT>S -- - -S- - Utilities and Equipment usage for overtime HVAC
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award, on a sole source basis, for commercial items prepared in accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures and within the format identified in Subpart 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; the Department of Justice has a need for specific building utility related air conditioning services for  office space, on an overtime basis [beyond the lease established normal hours of building operations], from Reit Management and Research, LLC [lessor] of the building located at 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C.   Because the Government only leases office space, logistically, we are not in a position to seek temporary outside support, i.e. portable chillers and fan coil units to condition the space; we are seeking inherently building related utility support through the building’s mechanical plant and making use of utilities provided under the terms of the lease.  The terms of the requested service are detailed in the General Services Administration’s lease agreement section 6.3, OVERTIME USAGE (Variation), of the Solicitation for Offers for this leased space.  Quotes are not being request and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This notice incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 16 [effective as of   10/31/03].  The proposed award shall consist of a base period and two (2) option years as follows: base period, December 8, 2003 - September 30, 2004, Option Period I - October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005, and Option Period II - October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006.  The provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors/Commercial Items Applies to this acquisition; as does provision 52.212-2, Evaluation/Commercial Items.  OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THIS AWARD will be in keeping with FAR 52.216-2, Economic Price Adjustment should either option be exercised.  (a) The Government may extend the term of this award by written notice to the contractor within 30 days; provided that the Government shall give the contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the award expires.

<SUBJECT>R -- 911th Airlift Wing, Pittsburgh ARS - Wings Over Pittsburgh Air Show 2004
<DESC>R- In the summer of 2004, the 911th Airlift Wing, Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station will host the Wings Over Pittsburgh Air Show.  This event is free to the public and is expected to attract 250,000 attendees.  The show features military and civilian aircraft displays, tactical and aerial demonstrations, fly-bys, equipment displays, food and drink concessionaire stands, souvenir booths, and more.  Wings Over Pittsburgh also offers a Children’s Area, which boasts ride simulators, youth aircraft education, remote control cars, inflatable games, a rock-climbing wall, and more.

The show has seen tremendous growth, attracting 80,000 attendees in 2000, 120,000 in 2001, and 200,000 in 2002.  The 2003 show was cancelled due to security issues.  Because the Air Show is a free event, we rely on corporate sponsorship to provide a world-class show for our community.  By participating as a sponsor, you are eligible for a plethora of benefits, including prominent display of corporate banners, corporate logo on printed marketing materials, exhibition space on the Air Show site, link on Wings Over Pittsburgh website and Chamber of Commerce site to sponsor’s site, public address recognition, and more.  The show has received and continues to receive heavy media attention from local radio and television stations and from the city’s most circulated newspapers.

The mission of the Wings Over Pittsburgh Air Show is to build strong ties with the community by allowing the general public to observe the daily operations of the United States military.  The only groups that profit from our show are the nonprofit organizations that staff our concessionaire booths.  This allows them to raise funds for their organization.

Becoming a corporate sponsor for the Wings Over Pittsburgh Air Show is extremely beneficial for your organization.  You will be able to display and promote your goods and services in front of 250,000 in one weekend, along with the many other sponsorship benefits.  Your company will work hand-in-hand with a very professional staff, which will work to accommodate your organization’s every request.  For more information, please contact Coleen Czachowski at 412-474-8241 or via email at Coleen.Czachowski@pittsburgh.af.mil.  Once we hear from you, we will provide you with a Wings Over Pittsburgh Air Show 2004 Sponsorship Opportunities Packet.  We look forward to working with you!
