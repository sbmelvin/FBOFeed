<DESC>The FAA has a requirement for continued Contractor Depot Logistics Support (CDLS), e.g., program management, development and delivery of documentation, and planning effort for the CDLS service to support the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).  The contractor shall furnish all required labor, facilities, equipment (except Government-furnished), tools, test equipment, packing, preservation and packaging, parts, software, documentation and any other technical or administrative support necessary to provide the required depot level logistics support.  WAAS CDLS support includes contractor management, integrated logistics support, configuration management, line replaceable unit (LRU) testing of all LRUs returned from WAAS sites, exchange and repair (E&R) and/or return and repair (R&R) of LRUs, fabrication and/or procurement of LRUs, repair procedures, supply support to all WAAS sites, response to web-based Logistics Inventory System (LIS) requests for parts, bar coding of WAAS assets returned to the depot, engineering change proposals, technical assistance/engineering services, and the generation of depot related Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) items as required by the FAA.  The WAAS uses a network of precisely located ground reference stations that monitor Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite signals.  These stations collect and process GPS information and send the information to WAAS master stations that develop a WAAS correction message sent to user receivers via navigation transponders on geo-stationary (GEO) satellites.  The WAAS message improves the accuracy, availability, and integrity of GPS-derived position information.  The contract is required for the sustainment of the WAAS in support of the National Airspace System (NAS).
The requirement is for a base year and includes option provisions to renew for four additional 1-year periods, to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA.  The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Raytheon Company, 1801 Hughes Dr., Fullerton, CA, 92833-2200, in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.
A market survey was conducted in August 2, 2007, through August 17, 2007, and the results of this survey supported the determination to solicit and negotiate with only one firm.  This announcement is for information purposes only.

<DESC>Requisition Number: FDA1041798

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order on a non-competitive sole source basis to Biomerieux, Inc., 100 Rodolphe St., Durham, NC 27712-9402.  FDA will purchase the following: 
24 boxes of ICS Assay kits #30435
24 boxes of ICS Broth #42610
24 boxes of SLM #30702
29 boxes of API 20E Kit #20100
24 boxes of VP-1 and Vp-2 #70422
48 boxes of VIDAS Staph Enterotoxin SET2 #30705
The purpose of the various kits or reagents is to develop methods used for training and the detection of foodborne contaminates which maybe a result of acts of terrorism or natural occurring events that effect our nation’s food source.  The knowledge and information obtained regarding this method for detecting foodborne disease and associated phenomena will enhance FDA’s ability to protect and enhance the safety of the food supply.  Biomerieux Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the Vidas test kits and supplies and accessories.   Center for Disease Control (CDC) has approved no other method for the detection program submitted by FDA under the select agent registered program and there are no potential substitutes.  No other vendors that can provide the capability required for FDA’s research program.  There are no approved substitutes and there are no similar instruments.  In addition, the methods used in the detection program make reproducibility and ease of use the “gold standard”, and this can only be conducted using known and proven methods that have been approved by CDC for all labs in the USA to measure and detect microbial phenotypes.  As the only known standard kits capable of providing the capability necessary, the Biomerieux test kit provides uniformity with the de facto international standard for research and rapid response.  To select any other kits and reagents would place FDA research in this area out of step with the research community and would reduce both the capability and credibility of research in this critical scientific arena.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.  However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the Agency.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All inquiries must be received by 10:00 AM (1000) EST on 23 April 2008 to the attention of David Kordel, david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov.  The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice. The award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>Introduction
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement to support genomic sequencing activities, which include high throughput sequencing, comparative genomic sequencing and genotyping.

Description 

This contract provides for the continuation of the Microbial Genome Sequencing Centers program. The current contracts are due to expire on February 28, 2009. Through this contract, up to two large-scale Genomic Sequencing Centers for Infectious Diseases (hereinafter also referred to as ''Centers'') will be established that support a diverse set of genome sequencing activities. For purposes of this contract, genomic sequencing activities include high throughput sequencing, comparative genomic sequencing and genotyping. High throughput sequencing capacity is defined as the capability to produce high quality sequencing data in a highly efficient manner with continuous increase in efficiency and decrease in costs; generate a diverse variety of genome sequence products; develop and implement new technologies; and maintain an automated production pipeline with a throughput of 20 million successful sequence reads per year. Comparative genomics and genotyping are defined as using high throughput platforms to examine the whole genome for genetic variation. 

Genomes that will be sequenced through these Centers include microorganisms considered agents of bioterrorism (NIAID Category A-C priority pathogens http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/default.htm), clinical isolates, closely related species and strains, invertebrate vectors of diseases, and microorganisms responsible for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging/list.htm).  

Emphasis will be placed on sequencing multiple strains and isolates of specific microbial species and communities than on sequencing individual microorganisms.

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following technical evaluation criteria: 

1) adequacy, appropriateness, and feasibility of the scientific and technical approaches to providing proposed sequencing and genotyping activities; 2) adequacy, appropriateness, and feasibility of plans to provide genomic sequencing and genotyping services and resources to the scientific community; 3) appropriateness and relevance of the documented training, education, experience, expertise and availability of proposed scientific and technical personnel in relation to their specific duties and responsibilities; 4) adequacy, appropriateness and availability of facilities and other resources including equipment, computation facilities, and software tools; 5) adequacy and appropriateness of plans for compliance with all safety guidelines and regulations; and 6) adequacy, appropriateness, and feasibility of proposed organizational and staffing plans, communications, project management and database management. 

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about February 6, 2009. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately 29.9.

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about March 5, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/). This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>Solicitation 8008-05 seeks on call (OC) flight services consisting of small (not more than 7,000 pounds approved gross weight), turbine engine, three-passenger seat helicopters to support Department of the Interior, (DOI) bureaus and offices in their transport needs within the Conterminous 48 States.  Contractor services include provisions of small helicopters, pilot(s), fuel, aircraft maintenance support, and all other associated equipment, as prescribed in the government's solicitation.  Mission activities are for interagency fire management program and other related resource support and may include, but are not limited to, fire suppression, fire monitoring, initial attack, prescribed fire, aerial ignition, rehabilitation seeding, and other administrative activities.  Contractor(s) must possess a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificate issued under 14 CFR Part 135, 133 and 137.   Aircraft offered must also be carried on the Contractor's list required by 14 CFR Part 135.63 or Operations Specifications Part D, "Aircraft Listing," as appropriate.  The contract period will be from the date of award through April 30, 2009 for the first year and if renewed, May 1, 2009 through April 30, 2010.  The Government reserves the right to negotiate project pricing should individual projects of 30 days or less be required.  Such projects that would arise would be for seeding and prescribed burning requirements.  Multiple awards are expected to be made.  SPECIAL NOTICE.  The DOI is in the process of making changes on how they acquire some aircraft services.  A DOI Call-When-Needed (CWN) program is being developed that encompasses several different types of on call (OC) contracts to support DOI aviation program needs and missions.  This solicitation is one of those on call contracts. Interagency approved small helicopters will no longer be approved or utilized under a DOI, Aircraft Rental Agreement (ARA).  Small helicopters supporting interagency fire management activities must be under an exclusive use or on call (OC) contract if the operator wishes to do business with DOI for this activity.  This is the only planned OC small helicopter solicitation that is planned for issuance for the next two years requirements.   If you operate these types of aircraft and are interested in continuing your for fire support to the DOI under DOI procurement systems, you will need to submit a proposal as provided herein and be awarded a contract from the solicitation.  If an individual aviation vendor holds a DOI ARA and the same services can be provided via the on-call helicopter contract, the ARA may be cancelled.  We plan on eliminating duplicate procurements when possible.  It is a requirement that any successful awardee must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award being made.  It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure registration is accurate and valid.  Solicitation information will be available through the fedbizopps site (found under Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary, NBC, Aviation Management Headquarters, Boise, ID) and at http://amd.nbc.gov.  This solicitation is set aside for small business concerns. The anticipated issue date of the solicitation is April 15, 2008 with a closing date of May 6, 2008. AFTER READING THE SOLICITATION, questions may be directed to either Toni Musgrove, 208-433-5022, Toni_Musgrove@nbc.gov or Matt DeLong, 208-433-5029, Matt_DeLong@nbc.gov.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The TRICARE Management Activity invites potential sources to provide an industry perspective to the TRICARE Overseas Program in order that the structure of the second generation of TRICARE Overseas Managed Care Support (MCS) contract may be developed to reflect best practices and innovative solutions to the many military health care challenges. Input and information may be provided in writing or through one-on-one meetings with the TRICARE Management Activity. One-on-one meetings are intended to allow full disclosure in an environment that protects any information shared. The one-on-one meetings will be held face-to-face at TRICARE Management Activity Offices in Aurora, Colorado; and will occur between September 18, and September 29, 2006. If you are interested in providing input into the future of the military health care system through the services provided under contracts for Managed Care Support, please contact Mr. Martin A. Martinez, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at martin.martinez@tma.osd.mil no later than 8 September, 2006, to make arrangements for a one-on-one meeting. If a face-to-face meeting is not possible, conference calls, or submission of written information will be considered.

Overview:	The Defense Health Program (DPH) consists of direct care provided by DoD personnel through Military Treatment Facilities (MTF), Dental Treatment Facilities (DTFs)  and clinics located  both in the continental United States and purchased care provided through Managed Care Support Contractors. In the overseas arena, direct care is provided to active duty service members and their family members at the MTFs, DTFs, and through contract support for remote and designated locations, to include Puerto Rico.  This overview is to describe the overseas purchased care portion of the DHP. Additional information is available on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil. In order to fulfill the purchased care needs of the DHP, sources/contractors must provide all services necessary to fully support DoD’s primary wartime readiness mission while supplementing the services provided through DoD owned and/or operated health care facilities. Information from sources/contractors should address providing clinical and administrative services that are comparable to the best offered in the host nation civilian community, Puerto Rico, and/or U.S. standards and fulfilling the objectives complying with the scope and structure of TRICARE Program; i.e., benefits and beneficiary liabilities, including technical requirements specified under the TRICARE uniform health care benefit. Information must address the expertise of managed care organizations and health benefit administrators in incorporating and operating the best business model and practices of the private sector in support of DoD healthcare delivery. Any contractor selected for contract award will have to provide the DoD with clinical and administrative services that are comparable to the best offered in the host nation civilian community, Puerto Rico, and/or U.S. practices. Information is sought to assure that the services will be delivered in a manner that achieves a fully integrated health care delivery and financing system for the Active Duty (AD) and Active Duty Family Members (ADFMs) permanently stationed in remote overseas locations.

Current Status of the Defense Health Program (DHP):	The medical mission of the Department of Defense is to maintain readiness through health and medical services provided to the armed forces during military operations, and to provide health and medical services/support to the members of the armed forces, their family members and other entitled to DoD health care. The MHS must be prepared not only to provide a high quality, cost-effective health care benefit to its eligible members during peacetime, but also must be prepared to support the armed forces during exercises, contingencies, operations other than war, and in wartime.

In support of its readiness mission, the MHS maintains a system of MTFs and clinics worldwide, that provide direct care to active duty personnel and to others who are eligible for military health benefits if space is available. Although the number and size of direct care facilities has declined in recent years and will continue to do so under the transformation of the military, it remains important that MTFs are optimized where possible in order to maintain the clinical skills of military clinical staff to support medical readiness. Currently, the direct care system cannot fully support the total demand for health care services; therefore, TRICARE uses the direct care system as the main delivery system, and through the awarding of MCS contracts overseas, augments the direct care system through a host nation civilian network of providers and facilities serving its eligible active duty service members and their families.

MCS services apply to approximately 378,000 AD and ADFMs of the Uniformed Services overseas: the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marines Corps, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, their spouses and children.
 
Currently, TRICARE provides two health care options for beneficiaries overseas: Prime and Standard. TRICARE Prime is similar to an Health Maintenance Organization with a Point of Service option and requires beneficiary enrollment. All AD personnel are TRICARE Prime enrollees, although they are required to receive all of their care either in the MTF or under special rules that apply to Active Duty healthcare. ADFMs who are command sponsored may elect to enroll into TRICARE Prime and are not required to pay an annual enrollment fee or co-pays for care delivered in the Host Nation network or the direct care system. TRICARE Standard is a fee-for-service option in which the beneficiary is free to use any authorized provider. TRICARE Standard is utilized by ADFMs who choose not to enroll in TRICARE Prime or are not command sponsored and by retirees who choose to live overseas and utilize their TRICARE benefit for health care.   TRICARE Extra is not offered overseas.  The two options of TRICARE are described fully in 32 CFR Part 199.17 and 199.18 which may be accessed on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil. 

Currently, TRICARE Prime enrollees receive all primary care from a Primary Care Manager (PCM), who may be located at the MTF or may be a civilian provider in the MCS provider network. The MCS contractor is responsible for providing eligible beneficiaries with other services such as network referrals, assistance in locating host nation providers for care, medical management, and beneficiary education. 

The MHS is organized into three TRICARE Regions overseas: TRICARE Area Office - Pacific (TAO-P); TRICARE Area Office - Latin America and Canada (TAO-LAC), and TRICARE Area Office - Europe (TAO-E). Currently, at a minimum, a MCS contractor is required to establish a TRICARE Prime network in designated remote overseas locations. 

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires delivery of a uniform health care benefit in the form of uniform healthcare quality, structure and patient cost-sharing. However, DoD is also interested in taking advantage of the expertise of the civilian sector and incorporate the best practices for the overseas environment.

Proposed Contract Performance Objectives:	A world-class health system that supports the military mission by fostering, protecting, sustaining and restoring health is our vision for fulfilling the MHS mission. To enhance DoD and our Nation’s security by providing health support for the full range of military operations and sustaining the health of all those entrusted to our care. As noted above, this is accomplished through an integrated health care delivery system consisting of our military hospitals and clinics, as well as services purchased in the civilian sector. The TRICARE Program is accomplishing this mission today through Managed Care Support Contracts (MCSC) that contains the following Contract Objectives. These Objectives are not listed by order of importance.

Objective 1:	In partnership with the Military Health System (MHS), optimize the delivery of health care services in the direct care system for all MHS beneficiaries.

Objective 2:	Beneficiary satisfaction at the highest level possible throughout the period of performance, through the delivery of world-class health care as well as customer friendly program services. Beneficiary must be highly satisfied with each and every service provided by the contractor during each and every contact.

Objective 3:	Attain best value health care services in support of the MHS mission utilizing commercial practices when practical.

Objective 4:	Fully operational services and systems at the start of health care delivery. Minimal disruption to beneficiaries.

Objective 5:	Ready access to contractor maintained data to support the Department of Defenses (DoD) financial planning, health systems planning, medical resource management, clinical management, clinical research, and contract administration activities.

These Objectives are not unchangeable. Potential sources may have more contemporary information on the proper objectives for achieving our vision and mission while clearly focusing on measurable, high quality clinical and administrative services achieved in the most cost efficient manner for the American taxpayer. We are also very interested in the industry’s thoughts concerning performance requirements. Requirements in this setting represent performance that must occur at or exceed specified performance standards and that achieves outcome based objectives identified in a contract. Examples of the performance standards may be found in the TRICARE Operations Manual at www.tricare.mil. TMA is very interested in the industry’s assessment of the existing performance standards and suggestions for new, revised, and or completely changed performance standards. Performance standards information is desired for the following areas of interest that are being included in the contract.

1.	Networks: Access to Host Nation medical and dental network providers, and location of networks. Offerors are allowed to propose networks where cost-effective. What does industry suggest in relation to networks?  Should the contract include a requirement for the contractor to develop a pharmacy network or just provide pharmaceutical services to include facilitation of processing and paying pharmacy claims only? 

2.	Referral Management: Beneficiaries enrolled to the TRICARE Global Remote Overseas Contract and the Puerto Rico Contract Overseas currently can self refer for primary care as they reside in locations distant from an MTF and are not assigned a Host Nation provider as a PCM at present.  How would the the contractor  review and schedule routine specialty care appointments?  

3.	MTF Coordination: Currently, a pilot program is in Europe to establish and maintain inpatient healthcare networks around selected MTFs and provide inpatient case management to MTF enrollees admitted to host nation facilities, and to implement a process to review and standardize the outpatient network host nation provider credentials. Close coordination between those selected MTFs in Europe and the MCS is critical to provide seamless continuity of health care services as networks and referral management must continuously adjust to support the changes in MTF capability and capacity that occur daily as the result of war, contingency operations, national disasters, deployments, training, transfers, etc. TMA is interested in discussing the impact MTF operations have on contracts and the extent to which this impact affects costs, and network management.

4.	Medical Management: We define medical management as contemporary practices in areas such as network management, utilization management, case management, care coordination, disease management, assessment of clinical quality and various additional terms and models for managing the clinical and social needs of the beneficiary to achieve the short and long term cost-effectiveness of the MHS while achieving the highest level of satisfaction among MHS beneficiaries. What is the value of each of the named approaches and are there other opportunities to enhance the quality of care while ensuring the appropriate expenditure of tax dollars.

5.	Claims Processing: TRICARE currently processes 680,000 overseas claims a year.  How can TRICARE achieve efficiencies while complying with federal laws regarding the expenditure of Government dollars?  What practices are recommended to screen and put processes in place to prevent fraudulent billing?

6.	Customer Service: TRICARE provides customer services via telephone, e-mail, web based materials, on-site service centers at MTFs. Currently, enrollment of beneficiaries into the current contract is performed by contractor staff at each TRICARE Area Office vs. the contractor. Should the contractor perform a full range of customer services to include enrollment functions and on-site service centers? How would a commercial concern approach customer service?  Discuss telephone service availability to assist overseas members when back in the continental United States.

7.	Automated Data Processing: TRICARE has a number of unique data processing requirements including Department of Defense mandated security procedures and certifications, interfaces with DEERS to determine eligibility on-line, processing enrollments through Government systems, and submitting payment records in support of claims processing activities. Many of these requirements are not negotiable: however, we are interested in the impact of these requirements on cost and the level of interest in proposing on future contracts.

8.	Management Services: This is a broad category that includes staffing, quality management/quality improvement, reporting, responsiveness to change, provider education, and managing contractor operations to fulfill the Governments performance standards while achieving the Governments outcomes. What should the Government require in terms of management services, how should they be measured, and how should the Government monitor performance?

9.	Incentives:	What positive and negative incentives are used in the industry, if any, and how do they impact your operations and proposals? What incentives should be created that would help achieve the goals of TRICARE?

10.	IT Services:	Anything to consider with regards to HIPAA, DITSCAP network security and electronic communication overseas?

The Government is interested in any information potential sources would like to address in support of achieving high quality, cost effective delivery of health care services. Please remember there are legislative limitations and recommendations conflicting with statutes may not be able to be implemented. However, any of the administrative requirement changes which support a more efficient TRICARE Program may be acceptable for information presentation. The Regulations, TRICARE Operations Manual, TRICARE Policy Manual, TRICARE Systems Manual, and TRICARE Reimbursement Manual are all requirements of the TRICARE Program and uniform benefit. These are available for review at www.tricare.mil and may provide insight to potential sources.

Any questions shall be directed to either Martin A. Martinez, Contracting Officer, Phone 303-676-3903, Fax 303-676-3987, Email Martin.Martinez@tma.osd.mil; or Howard D. Redden, Contract Administrator, Phone 303-676-3919, Fax 303-676-3987, Email Howard.Redden.ctr@tma.osd.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>BACKGROUND

The U.S. Census Bureau’s mission is to collect and disseminate timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States.  Over 200 years ago, the United States Constitution laid the foundation for what is today one of the world’s largest and most comprehensive data gathering organizations.  Every month, quarter, and year, the Census Bureau plans and conducts over 100 sample surveys that update and add to information from the economic census (taken every five years) and the population census (taken every ten years). These data collections would be impossible without continuous research and development.

The Census Bureau’s core business is conducting large-scale surveys and censuses.  This includes a full range of activities required to produce data, including list development, sample selection and estimation, questionnaire design, enumeration, and data capture, processing, tabulation, analysis and dissemination.  To remain preeminent in this field, we must conduct scientific research and technological development to support our capabilities to carry out the tasks for surveys and censuses.  We must research methodological and statistical advances that may reduce cost and resources and improve quality.  We must stay abreast of the latest technological advances through assessment and conduct research on the use of such technology to take advantage of its capabilities.  We must be aware of our customers' and respondents' concerns and willingness to participate.  We must evaluate programs and practices to determine if they are achieving desired results at a reasonable cost, especially in light of the current environment of cost effective government programs.


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) 2013 MARKET RESEARCH    
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION


The U.S. Census Bureau intends to conduct market research with companies/organizations performing research and development to learn more about the industry and best practices currently performed that may be similar in magnitude to a forthcoming Bureau project.  The latter will assist the Bureau in understanding how to ensure small businesses are provided opportunities to the maximum extent possible for the purpose of this project.

The  Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for Market Research purposes in planning for the R&D 2013 requirement.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) by the Bureau.  The Bureau is not accepting offers at this time nor will the information provided be evaluated or considered as an offer.  This Market Research information does not commit the Bureau to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Census Bureau is not responsible for any administrative cost incurred by a contractor in response to this request.  

Although answers to these questions are optional, the Bureau will appreciate and encourages companies to submit responses based on their knowledge and experience in the field of research and development.  Based on the information provided, and as part of its ongoing market research, the Bureau may contact individual respondents for additional information.

All information provided will be kept confidential and will be utilized for market research purposes directly related to the Research and Development (R&D) 2013 requirement.

INSTRUCTIONS

The official website for the R&D 2013 contract has been created and can be accessed at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/rd2013.  Industry representatives are encouraged to visit the website to view the draft statement of work and complete the above-mentioned market reserach suvey.   Please submit your market research responses by 3:00 P.M. Eastern Time on April 16, 2008.

FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.  The soldiers room s hall include, but not be limited to: private sleeping areas, walk-in closets, a shared bathroom and kitchenette.  Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  The varying components for t his facility will be: building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary a s required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task order s at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.   CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonst rating their cap ability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no  more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.   In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criter ia described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Gover nment, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Govern ment will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought
---------------
A.	 General Information

NOTE:   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS A COMPLETE REPLACEMENT FOR SOLICITATION NUMBER TMAR2-SS55.  ALL INTERESTED VENDORS MUST SUBMIT FOR THE FIRST TIME OR RE-SUBMIT THEIR RESPONSES REFERENCING THE NEW SOLICITATION REFERENCE NUMBER ASSIGNED TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of  Pulse Oximeter Sensors, to include, but not limited to, sensors for the adult, pediatric, and neonatal patient population.. The major facilities in the area includes: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

    The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  
   
Point of Contact Robert Meinertzhagen, 757-953-2134, Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Mid-Atlantic Region is seeking a complete product line of Pulse Oximeter Sensors, to include, but not limited to, sensors for the adult, pediatric, and neonatal patient population which includes at a minimum but is not limited to the high volume items indicated below. 

CDMIA Sales	Product Description
$412,289.78	Sensor Pulse Oximetry Disposable Adult/Neonatal Adhesive Strap 18in Cable f/Oxisensor II
$112,923.92	Sensor Pulse Oximetry Disposable Adult/Neonatal Adhesive Strap 18in Cable f/Oxisensor II
$57,557.26	Sensor Pulse Oximetry Disposable Infant Adhesive Strap 18in Cable f/Oxisensor II
$22,932.17	Sensor Pulse Oximetry Disposable Pediatric Adhesive Strap 18in Cable f/Oxisensor II
$18,654.56	Sensor Pulse Oximetry Disposable Adult Adhesive Strap 18in Cable f/Oxisensor II


The approximate total annual purchase volume of all types of Pulse Oximeter Sensors is $650,593 for the Mid-Atlantic region and is based upon the historical usage of standardized Pulse Oximeter Sensors over a one year period.  This is included as a reporting metric.
The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final award recommendation will be determined by utilizing the best value and trade off criteria.  

At the request of the Mid-Atlantic Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of these products, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your response to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) (3) your company’s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) number and (4) your companies responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  Your email will include your agreement to provide for your products necessary technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers that represent a discount from your companies base uncommitted DAPA pricing. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.   If required, any postal mailings should be sent to the following address: 


Robert Meinertzhagen
Tri-Service Regional Business Office
Financial Operations Department, Bldg. 250
Naval Medical Center Portsmouth
620 John Paul Jones Circle
Portsmouth, VA  23708

Email responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on the specified closing date/time of this Sources Sought FBO Notice.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from participation in this standardization effort.

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  

Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the TRBO via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

1.	Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M., fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting.  However, the Government reserves the right to invoke evaluations in an inpatient setting.

2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement using a zero to seven rating scale. Zero is equal to not acceptable and seven is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all products.  Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 3.75 is a target acceptability threshold.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.75 depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the 3.75.  Below this threshold, products will be unacceptable clinically and not eligible for consideration for standardization and will not be considered further

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for the purpose of evaluation of the technical criteria means the responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: (1) the vendor  offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the  vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the product line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community in which such products and/or services are applicable; (3) the vendor has a DAPA for the product line, products and/or services; (4) the vendor has a commercial agreement covering the product line, products and/or services with Owens and Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region ; (5) the vendor intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the  vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Vendors must provide a response to each criteria listed below:

1. Vendors are required to provide a full line of a full line of Pulse Oximeter Sensors for adult, pediatric, and neonate patient populations. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  
2. Vendor’s Pulse Oximeter Sensors must be available through the regional Prime Vendor, Owens & Minor. Companies that do not have a distribution contract/agreement with the Prime Vendor will be eliminated from further consideration.
3. Vendors are required to provide their DAPA Number. Vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified from further consideration. 
4. Vendors must offer discounts from the DAPA pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, FSS prices do not represent discounts off the DAPA.  
5. Vendors must identify if products are latex free/safe and labeled appropriately
6. Vendors are required to provide the brands their company manufactures and/or distributes.
7. Vendors are required to provide a list of styles and sizes for the products their company offers.
8. Vendors must provide the following information for each Pulse Oximeter Sensor product line their company offers:

<DESC>A.	General Information
This announcement is being reposted.  Vendors that have responded to the previous posting dated February 12, 2008 are not required to resubmit a response unless there is a change to their original submission.  If there is a resubmission, the original submission will be voided in its entirety.

The Southwest Region is standardizing for a possible multi-vendor award for Central Venous Catheters & Supplies.  The region recognizes this is a specialized category in which vendors may manufacture and/or distribute subsets of the category.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs’ needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes central venous catheters for use in cardiology, vascular and interventional medicine placed centrally or peripherally for short, intermediate, or long term care and their supplies. 
The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit’s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN 
Tri-Service Regional Business Office 
MSMMO - Southwest Region 
34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria
1.	Vendors must provide central venous catheters and supplies like Catheter Dual Lumen PICC 5 Fr., Kit Triple Lumen Catheters 7X8 20CM, X-Port Arm Insertion Port, Stopcock Walrus, Set Radial Artery, Catheter Single Lumen 4 Fr., and Stopcock Large Bore 4-way among others.  Vendors must provide a list of the products they supply in this product line and the brand name to include the type, size and configuration.
2.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor supporting our Region, Cardinal Health or will be disqualified.
3.	Vendors must have a DAPA number or is in the process of obtaining a DAPA or will be disqualified.
4.	Your product line must be latex free and this must be indicated on the packaging of the product.
5.	Vendors must provide product literature for this product line.
6.	Vendors must provide 24/7 customer support and identify company resources for such support with their initial submittals.
7.	Vendors must submit prices lower than their DAPA or will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, national FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA
8.	Your products must meet the FDA requirements for medical devices.
9.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic excel format upon request.
10.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls/alerts that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for central venous catheters and supplies including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  This represents your sole opportunity to present this information. Provide any mitigating factors that you may have in order to provide a proper context for the cited back orders, recalls, etc.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the “break”, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria Evaluation
1.	The catheter can be inserted easily and smoothly.
2.	The maximum barrier feature protects the user against blood borne pathogen exposure.
3.	The catheter is made of high quality sturdy material that resists kinks, bends and breakage.
4.	The catheter has a feature that prevents needlestick injury.
5.	The catheter can be connected securely to tubing and other monitoring equipment to prevent leakage.

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

9.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic excel format upon request.
10.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls/alerts that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for monitoring catheters and supplies including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  This represents your sole opportunity to present this information. Provide any mitigating factors that you may have in order to provide a proper context for the cited back orders, recalls, etc.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the “break”, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria

1.	The catheter can be inserted easily and smoothly to prevent trauma to the tissue and vessel.
2.	The maximum barrier feature protects the user against blood borne pathogen exposure.
3.	The catheter is made of high quality sturdy material that resists kinks, bends and breakage to prevent injury to the patient.
4.	The catheter has a feature that prevents needlestick injury to prevent the transmission of blood borne pathogens.
5.	The catheter can be connected securely to tubing and other monitoring equipment to prevent leakage.

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to award a sole source purchase order to ArkData AB, Inc., for the purchase of the company’s standard software maintenance service for the Software Quality Assurance (SQuA) source code control utility. These services have been determined to meet the definition of commercial items in accordance with Part 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  

The IRS requires the brand name “SQuA”, because the SQuA software application is substantially customized, unique and extremely complex Tier I Unisys system. This highly customized configuration control tool is used to manage version control and transmittal functions for the tax administration application source code throughout its entire development life cycle. The IRS tax administration source code on the Unisys mainframes is controlled and managed using SQuA. As a result of the agency’s integral dependence on SQuA for the above described functions, considering utilizing another source code control tool for the agency at this critical period would result in an unacceptable level of disruption and risk to all aspects of tax administration from applications development through production implementation.
 
Vendors who can provide the required services at prices, terms and conditions equal to or better than those which can be provided by ArkData AB, Inc., should submit clear and convincing data in writing substantiating an ability to furnish the entire requirement.  Telephonic or email inquiries will not be accepted.  Responses to this notice must be received by this office by 05:00 pm ED/ST on April 14, 2008.  Responses should be sent to:  Internal Revenue Service, Office of Procurement, 6009 Oxon Hill Road, Oxon Hill, MD 20745, Attn: Eddie Ortiz, OS:A:P:I:F:A.  Responses will be accepted by facsimile at (202)283-4427.  These responses may not exceed 10 pages. A formal solicitation may be issued if a response is received that meets IRS's requirements, and the analysis of both technical and pricing documentation indicate a competitive acquisition would be more advantageous to the Government.  Currently, no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  Requests for same will be considered non-responsive.  The reference number for this announcement is Q8QEC1TAA00-000.  If no compelling responses are received, the award will be made to ArkData AB, Inc.

<DESC>	The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) plans to negotiate on a competitive basis to award an Echocardiography Reading Center (Echo RC) contract as part of the renewal of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. The CARDIA renewal involves a Year 25 clinical examination (Year 25 Exam) of the cohort that includes repeat and new measures to be performed June 2010 through May 2011; and continued follow-up contact and clinical events surveillance of the cohort through September 30, 2013. The Echo RC’s effort is expected to begin on March 1, 2009 and to end September 30, 2013. The CARDIA Echo RC contractor will be responsible for the various aspects related to the echocardiographic measurements to be collected and assessed in the Year 25 Exam.
	
	The CARDIA Study started as a study of the distribution and evolution of risk factors for cardiovascular disease during young adulthood in black and white men and women.  The Study began recruitment in 1985 and has completed 7 examinations over 20 years in a cohort of 5,115 men and women aged 18-30 years in four communities.  The original cohort had approximately equal representation by blacks and whites, men and women, those aged 18-24 and 25-30 years, and those with no more than and more than a high school education.  The baseline examination (Year 0) was conducted over a 14-month period during 1985-86.  The examination consisted of questionnaires on sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and psychological factors; an exercise treadmill test; resting electrocardiography; a diet history assessment; anthropometry; pulmonary function testing; resting blood pressure; and fasting blood measurements.  Six additional examinations have been completed every 2-5 years, including most recently a Year 20 examination completed in 2006.  Retention of the surviving cohort was 90, 86, 81, 79, 74, and 72 percent at each of the respective follow-up examinations. Repeat measurements on several traditional risk factors have used the same methods at each examination to assess age and secular trends in these factors during young adulthood.  In selected years, additional measurements have been made, including echocardiography at Year 5 (in nearly the full cohort) and Year 10 (in a subset of the cohort).  
	
	At the Year 25 Exam (to be conducted from June 2010 through May 2011), participants will be 43-55 years old, when risk factors and subclinical abnormalities become more prevalent and clinical events begin to emerge.  CARDIA offers the opportunity to address aspects of the development and progression of subclinical vascular, ventricular, and pulmonary function abnormalities that cannot be addressed in older cohorts.  The renewal of the CARDIA study will address five objectives: 1) Assess the impact of timing and varying levels of risk factors throughout young adulthood on the development of subclinical ventricular, vascular, and pulmonary function abnormalities in mid-life; 2) Examine young adult antecedents and consequences of obesity and the longitudinal relationships and interactions among adiposity, insulin resistance, and inflammation; 3) Identify determinants and trajectories of subclinical disease development in women during menopause transition compared to men of similar age; 4)	Further assess the basis for racial differences in subclinical disease development; 5) Provide a platform for in-depth ancillary studies in cardiovascular and other areas.
	
The technical requirements associated with this acquisition for the CARDIA Echo RC include the following:

1.	Develop the protocol for the acquisition, reading, and information abstraction of the echocardiograms to be performed as part of the CARDIA Year 25 Exam.  As much as feasible, the protocol shall aim to be comparable to the echocardiographic examination performed during the Year 5 Exam.

2.	Determine comparability of the proposed echocardiographic protocol for the Year 25 Exam to that for the Year 5 Exam by performing repeat measures of a subset of videotaped echocardiograms and 10% blind duplicated measures of studies from the Year 5 Exam.

3.	Convert the videotaped echocardiograms from the CARDIA Year 5 and Year 10 Exams into digital electronic files and copied onto disks for secure archival storage.

4.	Train and certify technicians for each Field Center according to protocol.

5.	Train and certify echocardiography readers at the Echo RC according to protocol, as well as orient professional staff from the CARDIA Coordinating Center and NHLBI Project Office who have quality assurance responsibilities. 

6.	Conduct a pretest of the Year 25 echocardiography protocol, including quality assurance activities, during the pilot testing phase of the Year 25 Exam, in collaboration with the CARDIA Coordinating and Field Centers.

7.	Perform readings and information abstractions of echocardiograms in a timely manner during the pilot phase and throughout the Year 25 Exam period (the approximate numbers of participants anticipated to have echocardiograms measured in the pilot phase and the Year 25 Exam are ~ 9 and ~ 3,500, respectively). 

8.	Track the receipt, reading, and storage of echocardiograms.

9.	Develop and implement long-term archiving and storage of echocardiograms and timely creation of backup copies.

10.	Visit CARDIA Field Centers during the early phase of the Year 25 Exam and as needed, in support of quality assurance efforts of the study.

11.	Participate in the Steering Committee, as well as the Imaging Committee and Quality Control Committee, as appropriate.

12.	Participate actively in data analysis, presentation, and publication using the echocardiographic data.

All responsible sources are welcome to submit a written capability statement by April  22, 2008, as revised from the original date of February 29, 2008, demonstrating their ability to perform the aforementioned technical requirements. This notice will close fifteen calendar days after posting. 

The capability statement shall include 1) the professional qualifications of scientific and technical personnel in accordance with the above requirements; 2) demonstrated capacity of individuals and the institutional support to perform the functions of an echocardiography reading center for a multi-center collaborative epidemiology study, including protocol development, information processing, and coding; 3) facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software to read echocardiograms and capability of transferring data between Field Centers and the Echo RC, and between the Echo RC and the Coordinating Center ; 4) evidence of ability to integrate potential advances in echocardiographic imaging technology into study protocol; 5) evidence of the ability to assess and monitor quality control for obtaining and reading echocardiograms; 6) evidence of ability for data management, including tracking of all Echo RC activities; and 7) the small business status of the firm. Evaluation of the capability statements shall be based on the first six of the technical points (criteria) above.  Each technical point (criteria) shall be weighted equally.

<DESC>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  No solicitation is available at this time.  The purpose of this synopsis is to identify organizations with requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein. Based on capability statements received in response to this Sources Sought Announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside.  All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice.  This requirement is assigned a code of 541711 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the small business size standard for such requirements is 500 employees. 

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is planning to award a contract for a BPCA Data Coordinating Center (DCC) responsible for providing the requisite personnel, facilities and services to support aspects of data collection, analysis and reporting in support of regulatory reporting for the pediatric clinical trials, and select preclinical data conducted under the authority of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA). BPCA was initially authorized by Congress in 2002 and recently reauthorized in September 2007, to improve labeling information for drugs used to treat children. This is a follow-on procurement to the initial DCC that was awarded in 2003, to Premier Research Incorporated, of Philadelphia, PA.  The purpose of this synopsis is to identify small business capable of transitioning from the existing contractor, in the case that they are not the successful offeror in a competitive competition,  a series of on-going clinical activities, in addition to initiating and managing new studies under BPCA. 

BPCA Structure – 

NICHD is establishing the newest phase of BPCA, by establishing a consortium of contractors to provide overall support for BPCA activities. This structure will require a high level of interaction among the various contractors and with NICHD.  This structure, henceforth termed the BPCA Consortium, will work together to construct, implement, and monitor the clinical and preclinical activities within the BPCA to improve the knowledge and labeling of drugs, biologics and devices used in children.  NICHD anticipates that communications and collaborations amongst all Consortium contractors will occur through regular scheduled teleconference, on-line activities, and face to face meetings.  This will be accomplished with the establishment of a “Consortium Steering Committee”, which will consist of the principal investigators (or senior staff representative) off all BPCA Contractors and the NICHD Project Officers of each contractor.  In the coming year, NICHD anticipates awards of the following contracts in support of BPCA:

•  BPCA Clinical Trials Network (CTN) to serve as the master contractor for the conduct of preclinical and clinical trial studies under BPCA.  
•  BPCA Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to manage and house all of the data generated from the Clinical Trials Network, including leadership, tracking and submission of all FDA regulatory documents generated under BPCA.
•  BPCA Repository to track and store all of the biological specimens generated from BPCA clinical trial activities.
•  BPCA Scientific Support (SS) to provide literature reviews, scientific analyses, market surveys and conduct workshops, symposia and conferences for the development of diverse pediatric therapeutic approaches to be utilized in the prioritization and selection of pediatric therapeutics for further study by BPCA.  

A major responsibility of the new BPCA-DCC will be to provide state of the art data capture and sharing in order to integrate the data from the clinical trials across dissimilar clinical specialties, and clinical sites.  This also includes the integration of data from preclinical studies as well.  The DCC’s responsibility will be to insure integrity of the data collected and the regulatory compliance with the FDA and NICHD policies on the conduct of clinical and preclinical studies.  The activities conducted by the BPCA-DCC will support data collection, data tracking, and data analysis and data storage for the generation and submission of all necessary reports to the FDA.  It is expected that the Contractor will understand and be able to perform and coordinate all of the regulatory responsibilities for NIH for the submission of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications and New Drug Applications (NDA), as applicable, under the reauthorized BPCA of 2007.   The regulatory requirements of BPCA 2007 also include assisting NICHD in tracking Proposed Pediatric Study Requests submitted to the FDA by NICHD Project Officers. The contractual period for this award is seven years.  The responsibilities of the BPCA-DCC will fall within the following categories: 

• Developing a Transition Plan and continuance of  regulatory support for approximately 15 ongoing BPCA clinical trials and activities  that are being managed by the current BPCA coordinating center, Premier Research, Inc.
•  Establish and manage a data collection, data analysis, and data storage system {in the form of datasets} that will support all pediatric clinical and preclinical activities under BPCA.  The data from these activities will be placed into datasets, developed and maintained by the contractor that will be submitted to the FDA in the form of a Final study report and a public use dataset. 
•  Provide leadership and support for all regulatory requirements associated with BPCA-related Investigational New Drug (IND) Applications and New Drug Applications (NDA or supplemental NDA), including coordination and management of all communications with FDA for clinical and preclinical trials and data. 
•  Develop, coordinate, and maintain a BPCA Data Safety Monitoring Plan, to include the establishing and maintaining a Data Safety Monitoring Board.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<BR>SOURCES SOUGHT FOR<BR>INTEGRATED TERMINAL ELEMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (EMS)<BR>1.	Purpose<BR>Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS), Fort Monmouth, NJ, is seeking information for a solution that would enable the integration of all subsystems at Enterprise Terminal Facilities (ETF) under a single management platform leveraging commercial Element Management System  (EMS) technologies.<BR>PM DCATS provides worldwide support for theJoint Warfighters by providing dedicated strategic satellite ground components and long haul terrestrial microwave communication systems, technical control facilities, command center upgrades, and deployed forces infrastructure.<BR>Large and small businesses that are experienced in providing turn-key satellite systems and associated support services for the satellite terminals specified below are encouraged to respond to this RFI.<BR>As illustrated in Figure 1, fixed site, DoD ETFs  are composed of many subsystems collocated in a single site. Major components include the antenna, antenna control and tracking, transmit and receive subsystems, modems, switching, multiplexing and cryptographic baseband equipment, timing reference, and power.  The current approach to terminal management is fragmented between RF and baseband management, and is designed around circuit based requirements.  ETFs currently employ an Integrated Control Console (ICC) to manage baseband subsystems along with a Control, Monitor and Alarm (CMA) system to manage terminal RF components.  As many legacy subsystems are replaced with new systems via technology refresh cycles, PM DCATS is interested in commercial EMS solutions that can be leveraged to create an integrated management capabilitythat can replace the ICC and interface with the CMA.  <BR>As DoD networks migrate to an Everything-over-IP architecture, the focus of network management shifts from circuits to networks.  Along with this shift, comes the ability to monitor traffic and correlate network behavior with the performance of supporting physical layer media.  For satellite communications, this provides tremendous insight into the utilization of limited satellite resources and the ability to troubleshoot and optimize performance onan end-end basis for the IP over satellite network. The integrated solution described in this RFI is intended to support the management of all subsystems at the ETF to meet network-wide policies, Service Level Agreements (SLA) and associated performance requirements for user traffic transiting the terminal facility<BR>It is necessary that the Terminal EMS implementation be cost effective, leveraging COTS products, and scalable so that the cost and capability scale with the size of terminal it is supportingand number of elements it is managing per instantiation.  For DoD installations, the number of elements to be managed can vary from hundreds to thousands of elements.  Terminal EMS should also be scalable to support multiple RF terminals at a single physical location.  <BR>2.	High Level Requirements for the Terminal EMS capability:<BR>Functional Requirements<BR><BR>The terminal EMS is needed to consolidate the management of many diverse components and subsystems into a single platform fulfilling the role of Element Management within the Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) model.  According to the TMN model, the Element Management Layer (EML) includes functions for the handling of individual network elements. At each layer in the TMN, the management system provides Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security (FCAPS) functions.  For the Terminal EMS, appropriate FCAPS capabilities would be provided as they relate to Enterprise Terminal subsystems. This includes alarm management, handling of information, backup, logging, and maintenance of hardware.  The Terminal EMS must manage multiple pieces of equipment from different vendors, and across different physical interfaces including Ethernet and serial.<BR><BR>Northbound interfaces will support higher level and centralized management functions including Network Management (e.g. at the TNC as illustrated in Fig 1) and centralized Satellite resourcemanagement (e.g. at the WSOMS as illustrated in Fig 1).  Through the northbound interface, the Terminal EMS will interact with the Network Management Layer (NML) systems to include performance management, provisioning, policy based management, inventory, configuration and logistics, to name a few..  The information flows both ways on the northbound interface, over which the terminal EMS sends performance and status data, and receives policies and configuration data, as an example.  It is anticipated that this bi-directional northbound interface could potentially support remote operation of lights-out facilities.<BR><BR>The Terminal EMS will function as part of a larger telecommunications network architecture.  Within the telecommunications industry, standards are being developed to create an open architecture for integration of multiple EMS and NMS systems.  The New Generation Operations Systems & Software (NGOSS) project within the TM Forum is a central part of this standardization effort.  In consideringsolutions for the terminal EMS, NGOSS and related standards should be used to the greatest extent possible.  This is expected to include the use of service oriented architectures.<BR><BR>Key features and capabilities:<BR>a.	Integrated User Interface.  TheTerminal EMS solution must integrate all subsystem components to provide configuration and monitoring functionality from a single user terminal accessible locally as well as remotely.  Secure out of band connectivity must be provided for remote operations.  The system will be operated by Government or contractor personnel and will include application software to provide a graphical user interface with conventional pull-down menus to enable system configuration, operation, troubleshooting, and real time system status. Appropriate protocols should be supported for local loading or retrieval of software for equipment being managed.<BR>b.	Views: The user interface must provide a graphical representation of the satellite terminal. The equipment view must displaya physical representation of components and subsystems. The functional view must display a schematic representation.  The views must be customizable to user requirements to provide a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP).<BR>c.	Key Features.  Utilize an open standards approach to interface (e.g. XML) with all legacy and future terminal subsystems is a critical requirement.  Providing a web-services interface is critical to ensure network centric operation.  Support FCAPS functionality and TMN hierarchy.  The solution must support policy based network management as a policy enforcement point for subsystem elements within the enterprise terminal.<BR>d.	Compliance.  The solution should support Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts and be scalable to meet future user demand.  The solution should be NGOSS compliant.  The solution must meet GIG initiatives for network centric transformation and management elements and networks.<BR>e.	Security. The System will need to meet all applicable network certifications, security policies, and accreditations, for example: DoD IA Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP), DODI 8510.01/ DODI 8500.2  and AR 25-2 Information Assurance (IA).  User authentication must be provided. Multiple users with different privilege levels must be supported.  Authentication options can include: multi-factor authentication (ie biometrics, tokens, passwords),  repeated authentication for critical tasks, several authentications in a serial manner, Role based access control authentication and user authentication as separate steps, or varying degrees of confidence in the authentication depending on the criticality of actions performed.  The initial vision of Terminal EMS is for it to be a black system utilizing a CDS to interface with northbound systems with the possibility of migrating to support a full red/black separation capability. PM DCATS is particularly interested in information regarding an implementation that provides a cross domain solution to support information flow between classified and unclassified information systems.  It is recognized that the use of a CDS may increase the security requirements for systems connected on either end.<BR>f.	Alarm collection, reporting and management: Alarms must be collected from each component of the satellite terminal and must be logged, and reported with the appropriate priority.  Alarm filtering and correlation must also be provided to support fault isolation and root cause analysis.<BR>g.	Provisioning and pre-provisioning: The Terminal EMS must configure and provision equipment as required. Configuration information must be locally stored so operation is restored if a piece of equipment is replaced without connection to north bound management systems. Pre-provisioning should allow equipment to be logically added and configured before the equipment is physically installed. Once the equipment is installed and connected to the EMS, it is configured and provisioned automatically through the network element manager.<BR>h.	Performance Monitoring and Reporting: At a minimum, performance monitoring and reporting will be provided for weather, RF noise margins, power levels, data rates, capacity, and dropped packets..  A key performance metric will be transport of packets in accordance with Quality of Service (QoS) markings.  DOD uses DiffServ Code Points to mark traffic to ensure that high priority and/or delay sensitive packets are treated appropriately.  The solution should be capable of supporting enforcement of user SLAs.  A full performance monitoring and reporting capability must be provided for all components.  The Terminal EMS solution must be able to ping various systems to determine active component configurations, including plug in modules, to manage configuration and inventory.<BR>i.	Diagnostics and testing: Diagnostics and testing of individual components and systems must be managed. Loop back and automated measurements must be preformed to support system turn up or fault isolation.<BR>j.	Database Backup and restore: The Terminal EMS solution data base shall contain a complete configuration and state of the satellite terminal. The data base must be robust, secure and able to be backed up and restored locally and remotely.  Depending on security requirements, it may be necessary to separate system software from audit logs in data backups.<BR>k.	Software download and management: The solution must be able to store, and download software to configure and upgrade system components. Multiple versions of software must be managed.<BR>l.	Northbound interface: Provide a standards based interface for northbound management systems (e.g. SOA, XML, SNMP). Pass through connection is required between selected subsystems directly to a northbound system. The Northbound interface must be secure and protected in both directions via firewall and protected from viruses.  The Northbound interface should be capable of providing all data relevant to ETF operations, in accordance with information sharing policies for DoD network-centric operations.  <BR>m.	Event logging: Logs and traces must be stored for retrieval to resolve faults and errors.<BR>n.	MIB support: Equipment MIBs shall be supported and MIB proxy service provided for equipment without a native MIB.<BR>o.	Extensibility and Scalability: Modularity and architecture must support the addition of new equipment and subsystems in the future with minimum cost and development effort.  The solution must cost effectively support small sites and scale to support larger facilities. Support for NGOSS compliant interfaces is desired to ensure the interoperability in a multi-vendor OSS environment.<BR><BR>3.	Future Desired Upgrades:<BR>a.	Unattended Operation.  The web services enabled single user interface shall support unattended operation with the intent to support full operations for a lights-out facility.  In this scenario, there is no local staff to operate the terminal.<BR>b.	Facility and Environmental Management: The facility may be unattended and require environmental monitoring and control of temperature and antenna deicing.<BR><BR>4.	Services<BR>The applicable services to be provided in conjunction with the Integrated Management of Enterprise Terminal Subsystems solution include: system integration and administrative support; operation; maintenance; verification and acceptance testing; Integrated Logistics Support; telecommunications security; engineering; Configuration Management; site surveys; system and facility installation; facilities, terminals, and support equipment.<BR>5.	Information Requested<BR>Interested companies should furnish the following information: <BR>a.	Name, address, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code of your company.<BR>b.	Point of Contact (Name address, phone number, and e-mail).<BR>c.	Identify current products your company offers which most closely match the capabilities specified above.<BR>d.	Available product brochures, specification sheets, photographs, illustration and technical descriptions that describe your companys current products that most closely match these capabilities.<BR>e.	An optional White Paper (no more than 20 pages in length) describing how your companys products and technical expertise could produce and deliver such a capability.<BR>f.

1  DESCRIPTION

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) strives to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.  Under Section 1013 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, AHRQ is authorized to conduct research, demonstrations, and evaluations designed to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).  The essential goals of the Section 1013 mandate are to develop valid scientific evidence about the clinical and comparative effectiveness of different treatments and appropriate clinical approaches to difficult health problems and to make this evidence easily accessible to decision-makers.  Achieving these key goals includes conducting research on topics for which existing scientific evidence is insufficient to guide important decisions about health care.  

To implement Section 1013, AHRQ established the “Effective Health Care” (EHC) program which supports a variety of scientific activities aimed at improving the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of public health insurance programs, especially those related to pharmaceuticals, devices, and other therapeutic interventions.  More information about the program is available at  http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.org/.  As part of this research program, AHRQ is seeking to identify commercial health care databases that provide population-based information about the utilization of health services, particularly national information about the safety and effectiveness of prescription medications, biologics, medical devices, surgical procedures, and vaccines. While some of these might be collected by government agencies, others might be collected by providers, vendors, foundations, and others for research relevant to AHRQ's Effective Health Care program.

2  PURPOSE OF THIS RFI

Through this RFI, AHRQ is seeking responses to a set of questions (below) to determine the feasibility of obtaining data for conducting outcomes and clinical effective research .


3 QUESTIONS

3.1   What data are commercially available to evaluate prevalent and longitudinal patterns of inpatient and outpatient prescription drug utilization, particularly populations and subpopulations relevant to the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP programs? 

3.2   What data are commercially available to evaluate nonprescription drug utilization, particularly populations and subpopulations relevant to the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP programs? 

3.3   What data are commercially available to assess relationships between the utilization of prescription medications, the use of other health services, and clinical outcomes, particularly populations and subpopulations relevant to the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP programs?

3.4   Among commercially available health care databases, what period of time is represented by the data, particularly populations and subpopulations relevant to the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP?

3.5   How do scientists acquire or access data for research purposes, particularly data from which patient identifiers have been removed?

3.6.   What types and levels of services are offered by the data owner or data distributor to process and analyze data?

3.7    What literature can be cited as examples to demonstrate that researchers have used commercially available databases to support scientific studies? 

3.8	What specialty databases are available, including population-based information about use of biologics, medical devices, surgical procedures, and vaccines?
 

4 SUBMISSION DIRECTIONS

Written responses should be directed to Jessica Alderton, Contracting Officer by e-mail at Jessica.Alderton@ahrq.hhs.gov no later 12:00pm (noon) EST on April 17, 2008.

Clark St. Ste 1102, Arlington, VA 22202. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541511.
<p>This contract is for the continued development of the F108 3D engine training program and software maintenance contract, to provide a program for Engine Run, Borescope and Integrated Drive Gearbox maintenance, to include trouble-shooting, upgrades, and site visits, if required, for the engine training program used by the Maintenance Training Flight at Offutt AFB.</p>
<p>The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
PURSUANT TO FAR 15.201 (C)

RFI for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.



Introduction

The Library of Congress seeks information from potential offerors as to the interest and/or capability to provide a commercial off-the-shelf system that will serve as a Customer Relationship Management system that meets the specifications outlined below in the technical and performance requirements section, and provides adequate technical assistance, training support and documentation to allow the system to be deployed, tested and put into production.  

Background

The Federal Research Division (FRD) is a small (fewer than 50 employees) division of Library Services, within the Library of Congress (LOC).  FRD currently houses its marketing database of contacts and activities on a UNIX-based bibliographic Database Management System (DBMS).  This command-line interface features a series of unlimited character data fields tailored specifically to FRD needs.  It is used primarily to store the agency and contact information for current and prospective clients. This database also maintains a historical record of client interactions in the “Notes” field.  The longevity of the database and the detail of the records have caused many “Notes” fields to become unwieldy, with an enormous amount of stored information.  These and other factors have prompted FRD to search for a suitable replacement Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.

To ensure the long-term viability and extensibility of the replacement system, only commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products are being considered.  Our research to date has targeted well-established companies – largely identified through Hoover’s – with a broad user base and a history of CRM experience.  To supplement the sales-focused nature of the corporate Web sites, research and news portals such as Gartner and CRM Daily were consulted for product reviews, technology trends, and an overall larger scope of business management software.  These resources formed the foundation of our research and shaped our initial selection and review of potentially viable applications.

We were satisfied that our initial research was thorough and far-reaching.  However, delays in obtaining sufficient funding for all aspects of the project have resulted in a two- year time lapse since the original research was performed.  FRD requires a Request for Information (RFI) to update its research to determine whether there are other potential vendors who can meet the requirements specified below.
 
Technical Requirements
Performance Requirements

FRD requires the contractor to meet the following performance requirements:
•	Provide a fully operational, fully licensed version of the software that can support up to 50 government employees/contractors and that contains all the functionality represented on the contractor’s demonstration version.
•	Provide quarterly technical support and maintenance as well as periodic software updates.
•	Provide consulting support as necessary to assist in the implementation of the software in both the testing and production environments and to assist in the transfer of data to the application from the existing database.
•	Provide training for FRD staff.
•	Provide a complete set of user, administrator, maintenance, and technical documentation for the system.

In addition, the contractor must meet the following general requirements and specific functional requirements.

General requirements:
•	The software will be hosted by the government in the LOC Automation Hosting Environment.
•	The maximum funding available for this project is $19,000.00.
•	The total number of users for the system will be less than 50.
•	The system will be used as a marketing management system with additional capabilities to perform project management and personnel skills tracking tasks.
•	The system must be easily customizable without requiring extensive additional development.

Functional Requirements:
	Must have the following capabilities and features:
•	Storage of detailed contact information for multiple individuals.
•	Ability to associate individuals with offices, agencies, departments and other groups.
•	Maintain cumulative records of activities and points of contact with clients.
•	Provide historical summary for proposed projects, associated costs, and funding status.
•	Searchable data fields.
•	Mail merge capabilities for letters, envelopes, and other correspondence.
•	Reporting capabilities for filtering records and providing statistical snapshot of marketing activities.
•	Reminder fields for upcoming and future scheduled events and activities.
•	Intuitive, graphical – not UNIX-based – interface.
•	Commercial – rather than proprietary – solution offering periodic product upgrades and maintenance.
•	User customization of data fields tailored to FRD needs and functions.
•	Mail merges automatically logged in activity record.
•	Full-text search capabilities.
•	Email integration with GroupWise.
•	Calendar integration with GroupWise (highly desirable).
•	Word processing integration with MS Word or Corel Word Perfect.
•	Drop-down menus to standardize data entry.
•	Separation of “Notes” field into discrete entries for various activities, rather than concatenation in a single data field.

Objectives

The principal objectives of this RFI are to provide LOC with:

1)	Establishment and implementation of a Customer Relationship Management System;
2)	Technical assistance in establishing the Testing and Production environments;
3)	Technical assistance in transferring data from the existing system to the vendor provided system;
4)	Complete documentary support for the system including operators manual, support manuals and training materials;
5)	Operator level and admin level training to selected FRD staff (approximately 4).

Applicants are asked to provide the following information:

a.	A cursory plan on how they would carry out Objectives One (1) through Five (5);
b.	A brief description of their technical capacity to carry out Objectives One (1) through Five (5)
c.	A brief description of the consultative process they would use to develop and achieve consensus on recommendations;
d.	An estimate of the amount of time needed to carry out these activities. 

Disclaimer 
This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.

Submissions
Responses for the information requested should be approximately 7 pages or more in length.  Responses shall be submitted electronically by no later than 5PM EST on April 28, 2008, to LaTalya Palmer-Lewis, Contracting Specialist at lpal@loc.gov.

<DESC>The George C. Marshall Center in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, intends to award a fixed price Sole Source purchase order to Total Walther GmbH under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Sources that believe they have the capability under this requirement may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified Government point of contact no later than 1 p.m. local time (CET), on 16 Apr 2008. Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.
The following is a description of the requirement:  A life-cycle replacement purchase of a Philips/Bosch (or equal) Digital Congress Network interpretation system used in the main plenary hall/conference facility in Building 105 at the George C. Marshall Center in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. Requirements include acquisition, installation, and integration of approximately 250 microphone panels, Central Control Units, and control software. Integration requirements are with the Plenary Hall’s Creston Control system and proprietary Audio Visual Switchers. Installation includes all cabling and programming to conform to the existing design.  Installation and integration of this equipment and components must be completed within a 21 calendar day timeframe commencing after 19 December 2008. 
Classes, lectures and special events are conducted with simultaneous interpretation in up to four languages using the Philips/Bosch Digital Congress Network (DCN).  The DCN was custom designed by Total Walther GmbH to meet the unique Marshall Center needs.  Routings and control of both conference halls are conducted using the Crestron Control System, and all audio routings and distribution are handled by the Sound Web Control System.  The Creston Control System and the Sound Web Control System were programmed by Total Walther GmbH to meet the specific needs of the Marshall Center.  Lectures and events are recorded via PAL DVCAM, VCRs and Avid Video Editing software for use in a variety of means, both analog and digital.  Both facilities can be joined via fiber optic connection and a Multi-CCU configuration of the DCN.  In addition, video and audio in multiple languages can be sent to the base closed-circuit cable system via fiber optic connection.  Classes and presentations are conducted using computers, Power Point presentations, DVDs, digital media, Video-teleconferencing via Tandberg 6000, and the linking of the two conference facilities.  Redundancy and backup are provided using a variety of switchers, patch panels and infra-red transmitters for the Philips Interpretation System.  Classes and lectures are mixed live to tape and the Avid Editing system using professional mixers, scan converters for PC signals, and cameras controlled by the DCN.  
Installing the new DCN system will involve the de-installation of 250 microphone/channel selection stations in the Plenary hall and interpreter’s booths, the re-installation of 250 new microphone/channel selection stations, reconnecting the units via fiber optic connectors, installation of Central Control Units (CCUs) in the Plenary’s Control Room, integration of the DCN system with the Marshall Center’s Crestron control system, Sound Web audio distribution system, Tandberg video teleconferencing systems, and 12 video cameras, and the programming of the DCN CCUs to correctly interface with the existing systems.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a contract to Drug Information Association (DIA) of Horsham, PA.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The contract will be made on a sole-source basis in accordance with FAR Part 13.  NAICS 611430.  This contract will provide support to FDA/CDER in accordance with the following description of work:  


DESCRIPTION OF WORK

1. Background

 In March of 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a white paper entitled “Innovation or Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products.” 1  This report called for research to develop and validate new tools and methods for testing new medicines on the “critical path” from the laboratory to the patients. 

In FDA's view, the applied sciences needed for medical product development have not kept pace with the tremendous advances in the basic sciences.  The new science is not being used to guide the technology development process in the same way that it is accelerating the technology discovery process.  For medical technology, performance is measured in terms of product safety and effectiveness.  Not enough applied scientific work has been done to create new tools to get fundamentally better answers about how the safety and effectiveness of new products can be demonstrated, in faster time frames, with more certainty, and at lower costs.  In many cases, developers have no choice but to use the tools and concepts of the last century to assess this century's candidates.  As a result, the vast majority of investigational products that enter clinical trials fail.  Often, product development programs must be abandoned after extensive investment of time and resources.  This high failure rate drives up costs, and developers are forced to use the profits from a decreasing number of successful products to subsidize a growing number of expensive failures.  Finally, the path to market even for successful candidates is long, costly, and inefficient, due in large part to the current reliance on cumbersome assessment methods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 “Innovation or Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New      Medical Products,” www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/criticalpath/whitepaper.html 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This report1 also identified the need to build a new product development toolkit -- containing powerful new scientific and technical methods such as better evaluation tools, biomarkers for safety and effectiveness, and new clinical evaluation techniques. The agency sees these tools as urgently needed to improve predictability and efficiency along the critical path from laboratory concept to commercial product to ensure that basic discoveries turn into new and better medical treatments.  

2. Context of Work/Public Health Benefit
Recognizing the importance of having better evaluation tools, FDA cited development of these tools in its critical path document.

We are gaining an increasing understanding of the critical role that membrane transporters can play in drug response, drug-drug interactions and toxicity. In particular, transporters in the intestine, liver and kidney work in concert with drug metabolizing enzymes to control systemic drug levels.    Through influx and efflux mechanisms, transporters can determine tissue specific drug levels and thus are important determinants of organ specific drug toxicities such as nephrotoxicity, CNS toxicity and hepatotoxicity. In addition, inhibition of transporters by one drug could result in drug interactions with co-administered drugs.  

An example of transporter mediated drug toxicity is the drug cidofovir. This antiviral drug causes nephrotoxicity; however, when administered with probenecid an inhibitor of organic anion transport in the kidney, nephrotoxicity is prevented.  FDA included co-administration of probenecid on its label for cidofovir as a means of preventing nephrotoxicity.  A second example is bosentan, used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. This drug can cause hepatotoxicity by inhibiting the bile salt export pump, BSEP, an important transporter in the liver.  

Thus transporters play a critical role in drug safety. It is important for the FDA to think about how to evaluate drug-transporter interactions in vivo and in vitro.   

The International Transporter Consortium (Working Group) consists of pharmaceutical scientists in academia, industry and in the FDA who have expertise in drug transporters.  The Consortium plans to sponsor a two-day workshop, which will include topics that will form the basis of the whitepaper, including:


Proposed Workshop Topics
•	Overview: Current Knowledge of Transporters With a Focus on what are considered to be the key transporters: the efflux transporters, MDR1 and BCRP, and influx transporters in the families of OATs, OCTs, and OATPs.
•	Technical Challenges:  Kinetic analysis; species differences; expression systems; in vivo models; 
•	Role of Transporters in Drug Safety and Pharmacokinetics
o	Drug disposition
o	Drug-drug interactions; transporters in disease
o	Polymorphisms and genetics
o	In vitro - In vivo relationships
o	Basic biology of transporters
o	Correlation between inhibition of transporters and toxicity
•	Tools for Studying Transporters
o	Imaging Methods
o	Cell lines, membrane vesicles
o	Quantitative PCR for Transporter Expression Levels
o	Mouse Models (humanized and knockout mice)
o	QSAR Models
o	PB-PK Modeling
o	Discovery of Transporter Specific Inhibitors; RNAi, etc…
•	FDA Guidances
o	Overview and issues relevant to transporters

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
The TRICARE Management Activity invites potential sources to provide an industry perspective to the TRICARE Program in order that the structure of the third generation of TRICARE Managed Care Support (MCS) contracts may be developed to reflect best practices and innovative solutions to the many military health care challenges.  Input and information may be provided in writing or through one-on-one meetings with the TRICARE Management Activity.  One-on-one meetings are intended to allow full disclosure in an environment that protects any information shared.  The one-on-one meetings will be held face-to-face at TRICARE Management Activity Office in Aurora, Colorado; and will occur between June 5, and June 16, 2006.  If you are interested in providing input into the future of the military health care system through the services provided under contracts for Managed Care Support, please contact Mr. Scott Lamond, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at scott.lamond@tma.osd.mil no later then May 19, 2006, to make arrangements for a one-on-one meeting.  If a face-to-face meeting is not possible, conference calls, or submission of written information will be considered.

Overview:  The Defense Health Program (DHP) consists of direct care provided by DoD personnel through Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) and clinics and purchased care provided through Managed Care Support Contractors. This overview is to describe the purchased care portion of the DHP.  Additional information is available on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil. In order to fulfill the purchased care needs of the DHP, sources/contractors must provide all services necessary to fully support DoD's primary wartime readiness mission while supplementing the services provided through DoD owned and/or operated health care facilities.  Information from sources/contractors should address providing clinical and administrative services that are comparable to the best offered in the civilian community and fulfilling the objectives complying with the scope and structure of TRICARE; i.e., benefits and beneficiary liabilities, including technical requirements specified under the TRICARE uniform health care benefit. Information must address the expertise of managed care organizations and health benefit administrators in incorporating and operating the best business model and practices of the private sector in support of DoD healthcare delivery. Any contractor selected for contract award will have to provide the DoD with clinical and administrative services that are comparable to the best offered in the civilian community. Information is sought to assure that the services will be delivered in a manner that achieves a fully integrated health care delivery and financing system for all Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries.

Current Status of the Defense Health Program (DHP): The medical mission of the Department of Defense is to maintain readiness through health and medical services provided to the armed forces during military operations, and to provide health and medical services/support to the members of the armed forces, their family members and others entitled to DoD health care. The MHS must be prepared not only to provide a high quality, cost-effective health care benefit to its eligible members during peacetime, but also must be prepared to support the armed forces during exercises, contingencies, operations other than war, and in wartime.

In support of its readiness mission, the MHS maintains a system of MTFs and clinics, located in DoD “catchment areas,” that provide direct care to active duty personnel and to others who are eligible for military health benefits if space is available. Although the number and size of direct care facilities has declined in recent years, it remains important that MTFs are optimized in order to maintain the clinical skills of military clinical staff to support medical readiness. Currently, the direct care system cannot fully support the total demand for health care services; therefore, TRICARE uses the direct care system as the main delivery system, and through the awarding of MCS contracts, augments the direct care system through a civilian network of providers and facilities serving its eligible members.

MCS services apply to approximately 9.2 million active and retired members of the Uniformed Services: the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marine Corps, the U. S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, their spouses and children and their surviving family members subject to the provisions of Chapter 55 of Title 10, U.S.C. Also eligible are Medal of Honor recipients (Chapter 55 of Title 10, U.S.C., Section 1074h.).

Currently, TRICARE provides three health care options for beneficiaries—Prime, Extra, and Standard.   TRICARE Prime is similar to an HMO with a Point of Service option and requires beneficiary enrollment. All Active Duty personnel are TRICARE Prime enrollees, although they are required to receive all of their care either in the MTF or under special rules that apply to Active Duty healthcare. Active Duty family members may elect to enroll and are not required to pay an annual enrollment fee or co-pays for care delivered in the network or the direct care system; however, other eligible beneficiaries pay an annual enrollment fee to enroll in TRICARE Prime. TRICARE Extra, which requires no enrollment, is an option in which the beneficiary may choose to use a provider in the contractor-developed network, with reduced cost-sharing for a particular episode of care, but is not restricted to use the network. TRICARE Standard is a fee-for-service option in which the beneficiary is free to use any authorized provider. The three options of TRICARE are described fully in 32 CFR Part 199.17 and 199.18 which may be accessed on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil.

Currently, TRICARE Prime enrollees receive all primary care from a Primary Care Manager (PCM), who may be located at the MTF or may be a civilian provider in the MCS provider network. The MCS contractor is responsible for providing MTF enrollees and Medicare dual-eligible beneficiaries with other services such as network referrals, population health, medical management, and beneficiary education. Therefore, a MCS contractor interface with MTF enrollees will largely occur in catchment areas, with workload driven by the MTF’s capability and capacity.  The MCS contractor is currently gains or loses profit based on the cost of (a cost plus incentive fee arrangement) all care and services provided to Prime enrollees (other than Active Duty members) having either MTF or civilian PCMs, and for all TRICARE Extra and TRICARE Standard care.  The Government encourages potential sources to comment on this arrangement understanding that provisions of law dictate that health care costs be underwritten by the Managed Care Contractor.  The MHS is organized into TRICARE Regions within the United States and around the world.  Currently, at a minimum, a MCS contractor is required to establish a TRICARE Prime network in each catchment area surrounding a MTF and in the area of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) sites.

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires delivery of a uniform health care benefit in the form of uniform healthcare quality, structure and patient cost-sharing. However, DoD is also interested in taking advantage of the expertise of the civilian sector and incorporating best practices.

Proposed Contract Performance Objectives:  “A world-class health system that supports the military mission by fostering, protecting, sustaining and restoring health” is our vision for fulfilling the MHS’ mission “To enhance DoD and our Nation’s security by providing health support for the full range of military operations and sustaining the health of all those entrusted to our care.”  As noted above, this is accomplished through an integrated health care delivery system consisting of our military hospitals and clinics, as well as, services purchased in the civilian sector.  The TRICARE Program is accomplishing this mission today through Managed Care Support Contracts (MCSC) that contains the following “Contract Objectives.”  These Objectives are not listed by order of importance.

Objective 1 – In partnership with the Military Health System (MHS), optimize the delivery of health care services in the direct care system (see the definition of Military Treatment Facility Optimization in the TRICARE Operations Manual, Appendix A) for all MHS beneficiaries (active duty personnel, Military Treatment Facility (MTF) enrollees, civilian network enrollees, and non-enrollees).

Objective 2 - Beneficiary satisfaction at the highest level possible throughout the period of performance, through the delivery of world-class health care as well as customer friendly program services. Beneficiary must be highly satisfied with each and every service provided by the contractor during each and every contact.

Objective 3 - Attain “best value health care” (See TRICARE Operations Manual, Appendix A) services in support of the MHS mission utilizing commercial practices when practical.

Objective 4 - Fully operational services and systems at the start of health care delivery. Minimal disruption to beneficiaries and MTFs.

Objective 5 - Ready access to contractor maintained data to support the Department of Defense’s (DoD) financial planning, health systems planning, medical resource management, clinical management, clinical research, and contract administration activities.

These “Objectives” are not unchangeable.  Potential sources may have more contemporary information on the proper objectives for achieving our vision and mission while clearly focusing on measurable, high quality clinical and administrative services achieved in the most cost efficient manner for the American taxpayer.  We are also very interested in the industry’s thoughts concerning performance requirements. Requirements in this setting represent performance that must occur at or exceed specified performance standards and that achieves outcome based objectives identified in a contract.  Examples of the performance standards may be found in the TRICARE Operations Manual at www.tricare.mil.  TMA is very interested in the industry’s assessment of the existing performance standards and suggestions for new, revised, and or completely changed performance standards.  Performance standards information is desired for the following areas of interest that are being included in the contracts. 

  1.  Networks – Access to network providers, location of networks (networks are required around military hospitals and clinics and Base Realignment and Closure Sites (BRAC).  Offerors are allowed to propose networks where “cost-effective.”  What does industry suggest in relation to networks?
  2.  Referral Management – TRICARE Prime enrollees currently require a referral from their primary care manager prior to seeing another provider (there are some exceptions for preventive and mental health care).  In lieu of obtaining a referral, Prime enrollees may use the point-of-service option and pay a $300 individual deductible and 50% cost share.  Referral management is also currently used to direct patients to MTFs who have the “right of first refusal” for any care referred by a civilian provider.  What are current practices in an HMO environment and how have these practices impacted cost?

  3.  MTF Coordination – Close coordination between our MTFs and MCSCs is currently critical as networks and referral management must continuously adjust to support the changes in MTF capability and capacity that occur daily as the result of war, contingency operations, national disasters, deployments, training, transfers, etc.  TMA is interested in discussing the impact MTF operations have on contracts and the extent to which this impact affects costs, network management, and industry’s interest in submitting proposals on TRICARE contracts.

  4.  Medical Management.  We define medical management as contemporary practices in areas such as network management, utilization management, case management, care coordination, disease management, and the various additional terms and models for managing the clinical and social needs of the beneficiary to achieve the short and long term cost-effectiveness of the MHS while achieving the highest level of satisfaction among MHS beneficiaries.  What is the value of each of the named approaches and are there other opportunities to enhance the quality of care while ensuring the appropriate expenditure of tax dollars.

  5.  Claims Processing.  TRICARE anticipates processing 170 million claims across all contracts (managed care, pharmacy, TRICARE for Life, dental, etc.) next year.  How can TRICARE achieve efficiencies while complying with federal laws regarding the expenditure of Government dollars?

  6.  Customer Service.  TRICARE provides customer services via telephone, e-mail, web based materials, on-site service centers at all MTFs, and thousands of briefings annually.  How would a commercial concern approach customer service?  How is that level of service received by your commercial clients?  What percent of a premium is dedicated to customer service other than marketing?

  7.  Automated Data Processing.  TRICARE has a number of unique data processing requirements including Department of Defense mandated security procedures and certifications, interfaces with DEERS to determine eligibility on-line, processing enrollments through Government systems, and submitting payment records in support of claims processing activities.  Many of these requirements are not negotiable; however, we are interested in the impact of these requirements on costs and the level of interest in proposing on future contracts.

  8.  Management Services.  This is a broad category that includes staffing, quality management/quality improvement, reporting, responsiveness to change, and managing contractor operations to fulfill the Government’s performance standards while achieving the Government’s outcomes.  What should the Government require in terms of management services, how should they be measured, and how should the Government monitor performance?

  9.  Incentives.  What positive and negative incentives are used in the industry, if any, and how do they impact your operations and proposals. What incentives should be created that would help achieve the goals of TRICARE?

The Government is interested in any information potential sources would like to address in support of achieving high quality, cost effective delivery of health care services.  Please remember there are legislative limitations and recommendations conflicting with statutes may not be able to be implemented.  However, any of the administrative requirement changes which support a more efficient TRICARE Program may be acceptable for information presentation.  The Regulations, TRICARE Operations Manual, TRICARE Policy Manual, TRICARE Systems Manual, and TRICARE Reimbursement Manual are all requirements of the TRICARE Program and uniform benefit. These are available for review at www.tricare.mil and may provide insight to potential sources.

<DESC>In May 2006, a Special Notice was posted announcing that one-on-one meetings would be held in June 2006 to discuss the development of the third round of TRICARE managed care support contracts.
The purpose of the current special notice is to advise interested parties of Department of Defense (DoD), TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) plans for the follow-on procurement of its current Managed Care Support (MCS) contracts which conclude in March 2009.  TMA has developed requirements and is now preparing a draft solicitation for the follow-on contracts.  After publication of a separate special notice, TMA expects to release a draft solicitation for industry comment in May 2007.  After review and revision, a sources sought notice will be published announcing a formal solicitation.

In the meantime, TMA is currently making a variety of Military Health System (MHS) data available to interested parties for informational purposes.  MHS data will be available in two different levels of detail and will be made available using two separate media. First, summary level data is now available on the TMA industry forum website linked to this notice.  TMA expects to add or to periodically update the data posted on the webpage; therefore, all interested parties should check back frequently for updates. Second, detail level data files will also be available to potential sources. Ordering instructions for this level of data are posted at the TMA Industry Forum webpage.  Due to the size and content, detail level data sets can only be provided on external hard drives and will require payment of a processing fee of $1,500.00.  To obtain detailed level data the person(s) or party requesting it must complete the Non-Disclosure Agreement provided by TMA; and return it, along with a signed check made out to Treasurer of the United States, to TRICARE Management Activity, ATTN: Laura Morris, 16401 East Centretech Parkway, Aurora, CO 80011-9066.  Upon receipt, the detail level MHS data package will be sent to the requester.  It is anticipated that detail level data will be updated; so upon receipt of an external drive, recipients should download the data on-board and mail the drives back.  

Potential sources may pose questions regarding data under the Questions & Answer (Q&A) tab on the TMA Industry Forum webpage. TMA will post both the data questions and the TMA responses on the website.  Only questions regarding data will be considered at this time.

S. Amy Corps of Engineers, 4820 University Square, Huntsville, AL 35816<BR><BR>Description<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC),  intends to award modifications to its Medical Repair and Renewal (MRR) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contracts which will increase the programmatic capacity.  The MRR Program requirements are currently executed via Firm-Fixed Price and/or Time and Materials Task Orders which are placed against four (4) ID/IQ Contracts in order to provide quick response for Medical Repair, Renovation, Conversion, Alteration, Additions, Construction, Equipment Procurement, Installation and Maintenance services on installed equipment/services at Government Medical installations and facilities.  All current contracts were made under full and open competition procedures.  The contracts were awarded in Fiscal Year 2003.  The ordering period for these contracts will expire in July 2008.  As a result, CEHNC has developed its acquisition strategy and is in the process of conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on MRR acquisitions under NAICS Code 236220.  The solicitation(s) for the follow-on acquisitions were released in July 2007, and the awards are scheduled to be made in Summer 2008.  <BR><BR>The programmatic capacity for the current MRR contracts was awarded at $500,000,000.00 for a possible five (5) year ordering period (one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods).  This capacity wasestablished prior to the award of the contracts based on an analysis of the type of work required, anticipated workload, effects on competition, the capability of small businesses to compete for the required work and upon historical MRR contract/program data.  The MRR customers have critical medical facility requirements that must be performed.  The patient care at many of these facilities is inadequate for their service members due to the failing and failed facilities, systems and equipment.  Many of these facilities support wounded and disabled service members returning from the Global War on Terrorism.  Patient care requirements at these facilities have increased due to the effects of the Global War on Terrorism.  Due to these unanticipated conditions, the original capacity was inadequate to complete the increase in requirements.  As a result, it is necessary that the contracts be modified to allow for additional capacity to cover the ordering period.  Based upon future anticipated requirements, it is necessary that the Government modify the current contracts to increase the programmatic ceiling by $78,500,000.00 which would result in a total programmatic ceiling of $578,500,000.00.  The Government reserves the right to unilaterally modify the capacity of each contract award, within the Governments sound discretion, in order to adjust for changes in performance capabilities.  Upon award of the follow-on acquisitions, new task orders will not be placed against the current contracts despite any remaining capacity.  <BR><BR>The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  DACA87-03-D-0008 (John J. Kirlin); DACA87-03-D-0009 (BMAR & Associates LLC); DACA87-03-D-0010 (J&J Maintenance); and DACA87-03-D-0011 (Global Engineering & Construction LLC, Small Business).  The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged.<BR><BR>The Government intends to award the modifications to these contractsconsistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy.  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result, given any other action due to current circumstances.  Due to the unique prior MRR experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring need for Medical Facility Repair/Renovations, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after the publication of this Notice of Intent will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this Notice of Intent is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Capability Statements submitted should demonstrate the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  Statements should not exceed five (5) pages in length.

<DESC>By way of this Notice and in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District, US Army Corps of Engineers, announces its intentions to award a sole source contract to Smith Root Incorporated (SRI) of 14014 NE Salmon Creek Avenue, Vancouver, Washington, for the purpose of acquiring the technical assistance and consultant services of SRI.  Under the contract, SRI will be primarily responsible for providing technical assistance to the USACE during the Chicago District’s undertaking of the design and construction phases of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Aquatic Nuisance Species Electric Dispersal Barrier IIB.  SRI is the only contractor that currently has the technical and management expertise needed to complement the mechanical and electrical systems of the Barrier.  To its credit, SRI has a broad knowledge base in Dispersal Barriers. As a sole source provider to the Chicago District-USACE, SRI designed and built Barrier IIA; the proposed Barrier IIB will have identical functions and similar design features as Barrier IIA.  The electrical components of these facilities (Barriers IIA and IIB) relate to one or more patents held by SRI, who maintains all licensing rights.  As the design of Barrier IIB is developed, it will be critical to consult with SRI to insure that features are consistent with the functioning of the patented electrical components.  The period of performance is for approximately 24 months (to include: one 12-month base period, with one 12-month option period). It is anticipated that the resultant contact will be a firm-fixed price contract.  This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers, proposals, etc.  However, interested firms may send a capabilities statement NO LATER THAN the close of business on April 23, 2008.  Statements should be sent to the attention of Anita Simpkins at anita.r.simpkins@usace.army.mil; ensure that the subject line of your email includes the title/description of this announcement.  Award is anticipated on or about May 16, 2008. This announcement is in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The point of contact is Anita Simpkins at (312) 846-5372.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center, 215 North Main St., White River Junction, VT 05009-0001, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement for the ongoing maintenance and content updates to include website developments and improvements of the National Center for PTSD (NCPTSD) website with Vermont technology Partners, Inc., work will include but not be limited to the following:The National Center for PTSD has an extensive Website that serves VA and other clinicians working with trauma and PTSD, veterans and their families, researchers, disaster workers, and other health care providers that deal with trauma as well as the general public. Vermont Technology Partners, Inc. (VTP) was awarded the contract for the major task of redesigning this website over the past few years and the site launched in January of 2007. The Web site is large and possesses information architecture and technologies that make the site too complex to be housed on a VA server at this time. Regular maintenance and service is required from an outside contractor. NCPTSD needs to continually update and maintain this extensive site, which contains over 2000 pages. A. Ongoing Maintenance and Content Updates (deliverable date September 30. 2008) 1.	Ongoing maintenance: For the 6 years prior to the site redesign in FY2007, we typically averaged 300 hours in ongoing maintenance expenses and in FY 2007 we required 460 hours. All websites require routine maintenance and troubleshooting problems. This deliverable includes all types of support services including but not limited to: posting of monthly materials, updating existing content, regularly crawling the site for broken links, helping out with the internet hosting, making sure internet applications and scripts are running as needed, and assisting with problems that arise. We estimate this deliverable to be approximately 40 hours per month; however we have been backlogged for the fiscal year so estimate that for the remaining six months we will require an average of 55 hours per month. 2.	Website technical management (132 hours): We also need technical work completed by someone trained in java and familiar with our site programming to do program management and general revisions as needed. This will provide us with additional functionality and content updates. We estimate this service to be approximately 15 hours per month, however due to the backlog this year we estimate 22hours per month. 3.	B. Website Development and Improvements 1. Statistical Package consultation and implementation (deliverable date. Mav I. 2008) Because of the intricacies in our new site and the fact that there is a wealth of information to track, we need to update our statistical website tracking package. We need consultation, advice and implementation to: -review various statistical packages -inform us of the options and features that are available -make an informed decision and purchase a new package -set up the new package and customize as needed to match our needs Engineering time 10 hours, research and consultation 10 hours, NOTE: this estimate is based on shareware and purchase of software is not included). 2. Fact Sheet formatting (deliverable date. Julv 30. 2008) We would like to improve the formatting of the final fact sheet documents that appear on our site such that for PRINTING the information is more user friendly and formatted to look like a professional handout, with identification of where the document is from and how to find more information on the website. We also would like to have style sheets for the various end use documents. Fact sheets will need to comply with VA look and feel regulations and specific 6102 guidelines (needs date last modified or updated, for site and page, date printed, VA seal and text: U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs, design improvements). Includes two rounds of revisions. (25 hours). This announcement is not a request for competitive quotations.  No solicitation document is available and telephone inquiries will not be honored; however, interested parties may submit literature detailing how their services meet the VA requirements to the Contracting Officer.  Responses received on or before April 16, 2008 will be considered.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice will be solely at the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The Asheville VA Medical Center (VAMC), 1100 Tunnel Road, Asheville, NC 28805 is seeking offers for a heart-lung machine, a device that maintains the circulation and oxygenation of the blood when connected with the arteriovenous system of the patient during open heart surgery; it is also called a cardio-pulmonary bypass machine. The machine is used in open-heart surgery when it is necessary to bypass the circulatory system of the heart and lungs. The bypass machine repeatedly draws off the blood from the veins, re-oxygenates it, and pumps it into the arterial system, bypassing the heart. The contractions of the heart are then halted by running a potassium citrate solution through the coronary vessels. The surgeon is thus enabled to open the heart and make the necessary repairs while the heart is still and his view is not obstructed by blood.

The hardware solution above was analyzedand tested for interoperability against other solution sets withexisting Department of State enterprise hardware and proved to be boththe best technical solution and value. All testing was based onpredetermined Department requirements. Wholesale changes in equipmenttype will result in large risks to the Department due to lengthyretesting, configuration, and design. The department will also notrealize a Return on investment in this product which will lead to a nonstandardized environment for a solution that requires cross platformconsistency. Additionally, Changes in design will place unnecessary riskto the Department in the deployment of disaster recovery sets due to thelengthy process of placing new eq  uipment on the ITCCB approved equipment list for enterpriseuse.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed above as theonly suitable candidate available in the market today meetingDepartment's requirements regarding cost, capacity, performance,scalability, packaging and durability as well as ease of use in thebackup model described above. Furthermore, the equipment is listed onthe IRM ITCCB approved hardware list. Use of third party equipment whichhas not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existinghardware and software will place the Department at risk and will causeunacceptable delays to the Programs schedule in support of theunclassified and classified IT refresh efforts. Additionally, storagearrays use vendor specific operating systems. Changing to anotherproduct of similar hardware specifications will put the Department atrisk due to documentation, integration, configuration, and installationprocess change requirements. GITM Pr  ocurement requires the brand name equipment listed above in (2) to beprocured on a brand name only basis. Brand name only acquisition ispermitted when justified as essential to meeting the GovernmentRequirements by FAR 11.105. As this is a brand name only justification,no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis forthis justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name hereinhave been determined to be the only items that meet the Department'srequirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.Although the requirement is restricted to brand name only, AQM will postthe requirement on FedBid and will included the brand name justificationwith the posting. The Government will award a delivery order to theoffer that represents the overall the best value. After extensivetesting of nine storage solutions (FilesX Xpress Restore RepositoryTesting Results version 1.0, December 14, 2006), the JetStor 412/416storage arrays w  ere the only arrays found to be compatible with the Departmentsexisting hardware and software.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) No. 0048-08, and is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.6, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24, effective March 31, 2008. ALL INFORMATION NEEDED TO SUBMIT A QUOTATION IS CONTAINED HEREIN. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED. This procurement is unrestricted. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 541519.  The EEOC contemplates awarding a Firm-Fixed Price Contract and is anticipated to be awarded in  April 2008.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Registration via the Internet Site at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting the CCR Customer Support Center at 1-888-227-2423, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Savings Time, Monday through Friday.  The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was established by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  This Act prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion or national origin.  EEOC is also responsible for enforcing: The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 which prohibits employment discrimination against employees 40 years of age or older; The Equal Pay Act of 1963 which protects men and women who perform substantially equal work in the same establishment from sex-based wage discrimination. Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which prohibits federal sector employment discrimination against persons with disabilities; The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) which further prohibits employment discrimination against persons with disabilities in all sectors of society; and The Civil Rights Act of 1991 which amends the 1964 Civil Rights Act to provide punitive damages in some instances for willful and intentional employment discrimination. The mission of the EEOC is to ensure equality of opportunity by vigorously enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination through investigation, alternative dispute resolution, conciliation, litigation, coordination, education, and technical assistance.  EEOC also provides oversight and coordination of all federal equal employment opportunity regulations, practices, and policies. EEOC performs its functions through a geographically dispersed organizational structure.  This structure consists of the Headquarters office, located in Washington, D.C., and fifty-three field offices dispersed throughout the country. EEOC has approximately 2,200 employees. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires the following Brand Name or Equal commercial item: 

CLIN 0001: Remote Conferencing Software (iMeeting or its equivalent): QTY:  l yr : $______
CLIN 0002: Telephone Access and Rates for User and Guest Users: QTY: 10 ea: $_________
                    Total Cost to the Government (CLIN Nos. 0001 and 0002): $__________  
                      
The software will be used to conduct training and meetings remotely. SCOPE:  For the past three years, EEOC has been using a remote conferencing software called iMeeting to provide training remotely, giving the agency interactivity between its students and the instructor.  This software allowed EEOC the flexibility to use it inside and outside of its existing firewall, which is a requirement.  The software is user friendly, allows application sharing, will record training sessions, and has unlimited conferencing between 2500 users.  The software also provides EEOC with limited telephone access.  If the current software is to be replaced, EEOC needs a solution with similar functionality and operating ability where the cost in transition time and money will be minimal.  The quoter shall also provide a transition plan if the current software is to be replaced.  Presently, EEOC has used the iMeeting software to create more than 20 training videos for our knowledge base and during the past year the agency has been able to provide training to more than 1200 people in computer related subjects.  EEOC staff trained Information Technology Specialists within its 53 field offices as well as at the Headquarters Building located in Washington, D.C., on how to use this software for their training and meeting needs.  This software is used extensively by many EEOC offices. WORK TO BE PERFORMED:  The quoter’s solution shall possess the ability to provide a minimum of 150 registered users and shall have the capability to conduct training and host meetings remotely from any computer to an unlimited number of users.  The software shall be used for communication, collaboration and eLearning.  The software must provide for interactivity between an unlimited number of students and instructors.  Communication shall have the capability of being used inside and outside of EEOC’s existing firewall.  The platform shall allow application sharing, recording of training sessions, and shall have conferencing capability for up to 2500 users. There shall be no concurrency limitations.  The platform shall also allow for limited telephone access.  Phone usage and voice conferencing shall automatically be recorded with web conferencing with no use of external devices.  The quoter shall provide a web-based solution available 24 hours a day. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance under the resultant contract shall be for one year commencing from no later than September 27, 2008, up through twelve (12) months thereafter. PLACE OF DELIVERY:  The contractor shall deliver the required software to the following address: U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Office of Information Technology, ATTN: Vince Monico, Desktop Support and Services Division, 1801 L. St. NW, Room 4014, Washington, DC 20507.  CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND NON-DISCLOSURE: The confidentiality provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibit disclosure of any charge, charge-related, or EEO survey information.  All reports and information from these systems will be kept confidential, as required by Section 709(e) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The Contractor shall agree that such information will not be disclosed and will only be used for the performance of their responsibilities under the resultant contract. EEOC's information systems contain personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (PL 93-579) and amendments.)  It will be the Contractor's responsibility to familiarize and brief employees and subcontractors on the provisions of the Privacy Act.  EEOC's information systems (including those systems or portions of systems supported or maintained by contractors) are Federal Information Systems, as defined in the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, and are required by this statute to be provided information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of  information collected or maintained by or on behalf of the agency; and information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor or other organization on behalf of an agency.

The quoter must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements by describing the approach, methodology, technique, or plan that the quoter is proposing to accomplish the tasks defined in the requirements as stated in this RFQ. The quoter must provide narrative statements, in as much detail as possible, demonstrating that their company has clear understanding of remote conferencing.  FACTOR II: Past Performance:  The Government will evaluate past performance based on a minimum of three (3) references for similar work or project information which would demonstrate the essential experience and skills necessary to address the requirements of this RFQ. The three (3) references for similar work or project information must have been awarded within the past three years. This factor will indicate the relevant aspects of the quoter’s record of performing services similar in size, content and complexity, customer satisfaction and timeliness to the requirements of this RFQ. FACTOR III:  Price:  The Government will evaluate price in comparison to the independent Government cost estimate.

<DESC>The end date of this soliciation has been extended to 16 April 08. 

We have the following questions concerning Sol: F3ZT908031A001 for the Blast Room Retrofit
 
In 1.0 the blast room retrofit it is described for a plastic media blaster booth 
However, in 1.5 it says that the classifier is for ferrous and non-ferrous dry abrasives
We use Type V Plastic Media 30/40 grit, this is used on ferrous and non-ferrous materials. 

1. - What is the blast media to be used and what size is needed? Is this the only media to be used?
 We use Type V Plastic Media 30/40 grit.

2. - Are you aware that mechanical and air wash separators are the least efficient reclaim method for high priced plastic blast media? This type of reclaim system is best for ferrous media or large size hard abrasive grains. 
 The mechanical floor system will fulfill all the needs of our shop and will meet all regulatory requirements.

3. - Is the contracting office aware of the limitations of the mechanical/air wash separation systems and their higher consumption rate?
 The mechanical floor system will fulfill all the needs of our shop and will meet all regulatory requirements

4. - There is no provision made to get heavy fines out via magnetic separation or vibration screens or a combination of both. Does this mean you don't want this capability or does it mean that Contracting does not feel this is needed?
 The mechanical floor system will fulfill all the needs of our shop and will meet all regulatory requirements

5. - Is a site visit scheduled for competitive bidders or has this solicitation been written around an existing vendor who has already seen the site and has their quote ready?
 The booth is a standard size and construction; therefore a site visit should not be necessary to provide an adequate quote for a raised floor and a new reclamation assembly.

6. - Is an extension to the submittable date going to be given so a site visit can be done and so these questions can be answered prior to the quotation being submitted?    
The booth is a standard size and construction; therefore a site visit should not be necessary to provide an adequate quote for a raised floor and a new reclamation assembly.

7. -Will the end user be willing to except a pneumatic recovery floor vs a mechanical sweep floor? I want to offer a mechanical floor, as well as pneumatic.
We will accept bids for pneumatic assemblies as well as mechanical floors.

8. -Also who is the manufacture of the existing Blast Room and related equipment? I believe that we (Pauli Systems, Inc) are, the manufacturer but I could be confused by other equipment we have at Travis AFB.
Yes, the manufacturer of the original booth is Pauli Systems, Inc.

9. Can we use a pneumatic floor instead of mechanical one?  
We will accept bids for pneumatic assemblies as well as mechanical floors.

10.  What are the dimensions of the floor?  
	The floor dimensions are 20’ 9” X 15’ 8”


Vendors must be actively registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  The CCR website is http://www.ccr.gov and also under the Online Representations and Certification (ORCA) on https://orca.bpn.gov.  Contractors are asked to submit their TAX ID number with their proposal.  Quotes must be received at the 60th Contracting Squadron, LGCB flight, no later that 3:00 PM PST on  16 April 2008.

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>As the Contracts Officer Representative (COR) for the Oracle/PeopleSoft software products used in the Department of State's Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS), I recommend the use of other than full and open competition for the purpose of purch
asing software support for its continued maintenance. The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the products -- however software support is a separate expense and represents an ongoing annual expenditure. The action to be approved is the order for Peoplesoft software support obtained through the Federal Supply Schedule contract with the most qualified provider. PeopleSoft products are the basis for much of ILMS. The PeopleSoft products currently used by ILMS include: PeopleSoft Inventory, PO, CRM Support server license, Object Studio, Balanced Scorecard, Enterprise Warehouse, Supply Chain Management, Activity Based Management, GL, and AM modules A full description of the software support services required for this purchase can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for the selected provider. The authority for sole source orders under GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts is Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 
501). Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support. This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS.<BR><BR>ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and custom
ize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS. Upon review of possible sources, a vendor will be chosen for software support for Oracle/PeopleSoft legacy software products. Since the services for the same software support were obtained last year, the universe of vendors has remained the same. These support services are necessary to maintain the existing production version of ILMS. The need to have PeopleSoft's technical support for the PeopleSoft software cannot be restated in a way that would permit t
he use of other commercial or non-developmental items. In the course of the development of ILMS, the Government made a serious effort to assure that Accenture, as the prime contractor, obtained as much competition as possible in subcontracting components of the task -- such as the software licenses and support contracts that it executed. To date, no sources have written to express an interest in this acquisition. When the Government assumes responsibility from a contractor for software licenses and support requirements that are integral to much larger IT systems, it is effectively precluded from competing the periodic renewal of such licenses and support agreements -- particularly if the systems involved have been customized and involve numerous proprietary components. The best alternative available to the government is to negotiate and contract for long-term license and support agreements at the offset.<BR><BR>

QUESTIONS FROM CONTRCTOR
Contractor: The ACB Explorer 2600 series vessel is limited to 350 HP yet you specified twin 200 HP outboards.  Please clarify.
Government: The ACB model originally specified was incorrect.  The correct model series is 2900.

Contractor: What size vessel are you looking for and how are you measuring the vessel?
Government: We require a vessel with a hull length of 28 feet. 

Contractor: Is there a desire for a head in the vessel?
Government: No.

Contractor: Does the Government desire a special electronics package or provisions for future electronics?
Government: No.  The only electronics required are those specifically detailed in the notice or which come standard on the speciified model. 

Contrctor: Is flotation ability a required or desired feature?  If required, can it be achieved via bilge pumps or does the government actually want foam or air chamber positive flotation?
Government:  Flotation is a required feature.  This is a law enforcement vessel and must operate regardless of weather or sea condtions.  The flotation must be inherent and not dependent upon the operation of machinery.  Foam or air chamber positive flotation is acceptable.

<DESC>The purpose of this mod is to extend the Solicitation closing date to Wednesday,  09 April 2008  2:00PM EST and to respond to vendor question.  Question: In the scope part 1.2 Classification there are options for the following: Type I, Type II, Type III, Class 1, Class 2, Grade A, Grade B. 
Which type, class, and grade is specified for this material? Response: MIL-C-9959B on the drawings is cancelled and should be replaced with the MIL-P-58102 spec referenced in the solicitation. The drawings require material and construction in accordance with Mil-C-9959B Type I.
While Mil-C-9959 has been canceled and replaced by Mil-P-58102, Mil-C-9959 should be used to determine the corresponding Mil-P-58102 Type, Class and Grade to Mil-C-9959 Type 1.  This information should be provided in their proposal. Mil-C-9959 is a water-vaporproof container.  This corresponds to Mil-P-58102 Type I. Class 2 (flame resistant) is preferred.  The existing covers are opaque, not transparent, therefore Grade A (opaque).  Grey or blue covers are acceptable, or other colors within reason (black, green, etc.) So our expectation would be material to Mil-P-58102 Type I Class 2 Grade A.

<DESC>The Space Superiority Systems Wing/ Technology Division (SYSW/ENT) invites interested parties to participate in a classified Space Superiority Technology Industry Day on 15 April 08 in the Aerospace Corp A8 Auditorium at 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245.  The purpose of the Industry Day is to discuss, with industry and government mission partners, SYSW capability needs and gaps in Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Defensive Counter Space (DCS), and Offensive Counter Space (OCS) mission areas; SYSW also desires to explore critical industry discoveries, innovations and technical solutions.  The Industry Day will be held at the TS/SCI level; thus, industry and government partners must be properly cleared.
SYSW/ENT Mission Area

The SYSW/ENT mission area supports a range of activities including technology planning, development, demonstration and prototyping, as well as modeling, simulations and exercises to support development of tactics and procedures in the Space Control mission area. The mission area comprises Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Defensive Counterspace (DCS), and Offensive Counterspace (OCS). SSA includes monitoring, detecting, identifying, tracking, assessing, verifying, categorizing, and characterizing objects and events in space. DCS includes defensive activities to protect U.S. and friendly space systems, resources, and operations from enemy interference and prevention activities that limit or eliminate an adversary's ability to use U.S. space systems and services for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests. OCS activities disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy space systems, or the information they provide, which may be used for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from potential offerors.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.

There are seven main Directorates and organizations under the DDR&amp;E?s purview: Laboratories and Basic Sciences, Science and Technology, Advanced Systems and Concepts, International Technology Security, Plans and Programs, and the Rapid Reaction Technology Office. DDR&amp;E requires highly specialized program and technical support services to achieve its mission. Details are available at http://www.defenselink.mil/ddre/mainpage.htm. AFDW/A7KI anticipates soliciting a requirement for a technical support team with the expertise to provide highly specialized technical, financial, administrative, and programmatic support and analysis of current and planned R&amp;E, etc. projects for DDR&amp;E and other Air Force District of Washington Acquisition Division customers as needed. The contractor must possess the specific technical skills and knowledge along with operational expertise and experience as described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>(a) The provider of information technology shall certify applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC). This includes Internet Explorer 7 configured to operate on Windows XP and Vista (in Protected Mode on Vista). For the Windows XP settings, see http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_WinXP.html and for the Windows Vista settings, see: http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_vista.html.(b) The standard installation, operation, maintenance, update, and/or patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the approved FDCC configuration. The information technology should also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default program files directory and should be abl
e to silently install and uninstall.(c) Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer. All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Gover
nment. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract. The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>Seller has read and agrees to all clauses, terms, and conditions in attachment entitled PR266352_FilesX_Equipment_Comments[1].<BR><BR>The Department has adopted and approved a solution based on the above which provides for rapid restoration of user files, e-mail and operating systems. The hardware solution above was analyzed and tested for interoperability against other solution sets with existing Department of State enterprise hardware and proved to be both t
he best technical solution and value. All testing was based on predetermined Department requirements. Wholesale changes in equipment type will result in large risks to the Department due to lengthy retesting, configuration, and design. The department will also not realize a Return on investment in this product which will lead to a non standardized environment for a solution that requires cross platform consistency. Additionally, Changes in design will place unnecessary risk to the Department in the deployment of disaster recovery sets due to the lengthy process of placing new equipment on the ITCCB approved equipment list for enterprise use.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed above as the only suitable candidate available in the market today meeting Department's requirements regarding cost, capacity, performance, scalability, packaging and durability as well as ease of use in the backup model described above. Furthermore, the equipment is listed on the IR
M ITCCB approved hardware list. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software will place the Department at risk and will cause unacceptable delays to the Programs schedule in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh efforts. Additionally, storage arrays use vendor specific operating systems. Changing to another product of similar hardware specifications will put the Department at risk due to documentation, integration, configuration, and installation process change requirements. GITM Procurement requires the brand name equipment listed above in (2) to be procured on a brand name only basis. Brand name only acquisition is permitted when justified as essential to meeting the Government Requirements by FAR 11.105. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand 
name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system. Although the requirement is restricted to brand name only, AQM will post the requirement on FedBid and will included the brand name justification with the posting. The requirement will be competed on FedBid amongst Federal Supply Schedule Holders in compliance with FAR 8.405-6. The requirement will be set-aside for GSA schedule holders only. GSA has already determined the prices to be fair and reasonable. The Government will award a delivery order to the offer that represents the overall the best value. After extensive testing of nine storage solutions (FilesX Xpress Restore Repository Testing Results version 1.0, December 14, 2006), the JetStor 412/416 storage arrays were the only arrays found to be compatible with the Departments existing hardware and software.<BR><BR>

Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software will place the Department at risk and will cause unacceptable delays to the Programs schedule in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh efforts. Additionally, storage arrays use vendor specific operating systems. Changing to another product of similar hardware specifications will put the Department at risk due to documentation, integration, configuration, and installation process change requirements. GITM Procurement requires the brand name equipment listed above in (2) to be procured on a brand name only basis. Brand name only acquisition is permitted when justified as essential to meeting the Government Requirements by FAR 11.105. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand 
name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system. Although the requirement is restricted to brand name only, AQM will post the requirement on FedBid and will included the brand name justification with the posting. The requirement will be competed on FedBid amongst Federal Supply Schedule Holders in compliance with FAR 8.405-6. The requirement will be set-aside for GSA schedule holders only. GSA has already determined the prices to be fair and reasonable. The Government will award a delivery order to the offer that represents the overall the best value. After extensive testing of nine storage solutions (FilesX Xpress Restore Repository Testing Results version 1.0, December 14, 2006), the JetStor 412/416 storage arrays were the only arrays found to be compatible with the Departments existing hardware and software.<BR><BR>

Requirement includes:  Design-Build tenant fit out (TFO) of 54,000 sq ft of Army executive workspace in the Pentagon to be complete NLT 19 NOV 08.  This area of the Pentagon was renovated two years ago and requires a refit for the new tenant.  A test fit for the workspace will be provided with specific area requirements identified for all areas of the workspace.  Design and construction efforts shall make every effort to protect and reuse existing structures, hardware, and finishes to accommodate the new tenant.  The workspace is currently designed IAW the Universal Space Plan (USP) and all new design aspects shall adhere to USP standards.  The USP standards for this space will be a combination of O-1 and O-2 space types.  Special spaces include a new full-service commercial kitchen, four private bathrooms, multiple SCIF conference rooms with audiovisual and acoustical requirements, and offices built to TSWA standards.  Design of the workspace shall support minimal alterations above ceiling, per the USP.  Corridor design shall match 2nd Floor, E-Ring between Corridors 8 and 9.
