<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND INCLUDES SITE VISIT INFORMATION.
<p>SITE VISIT NOTICE:</p>
<p>Information regarding scheduled site visit is included in this pre-solicitation notice. If your firm intends to participate in the site visit, a complete response is required as outlined within the "Site Visit Information" section of this notice. Other than site visit attendee information, no further information is requested at this time.</p>
<p>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE:</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION [INVITATION FOR BID (IFB)] OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is being issued for the purpose of advising potential offerors of the Government's requirement for a performance-based remediation (PBR) effort at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. The subject pre-solicitation notice is to provide information for early planning and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. There is no entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges that arise as a result of the provision of this information. Note that official information concerning this pre-solicitation will be provided by the Contracting Officer only.<br /><br />GENERAL INFORMATION:&nbsp;&nbsp;The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) in conjunction with the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), at Lackland AFB, TX, is contemplating a performance-based approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts to include engineering, restoration, and construction services at thirty (30) Installation Restoration Program (IRP) sites at Scott AFB, IL.</p>
<p>This effort is a validated FY2014 requirement; however, funds are not currently available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time. Should the Air Force determine to proceed with this requirement, it will be processed using FAR Part 15 procedures and will result in a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), "C" type contract. The requirement will be issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. A formal solicitation will be finalized and posted to FedBizOpps at a later date. No formal Request for Proposal has been issued to-date.<br /><br />PROJECT NARRATIVE:&nbsp;&nbsp;The 772 ESS/PKB is considering a performance-based approach for SC involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL. Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) emphasizes results in terms of environmental clean-up for an entire installation (fence-to-fence), or group of installations, in lieu of a study-based approach. The PBR approach looks for technically and cost-effective methods for achieving this clean-up by focusing on achievement of desired objectives without specifying the processes or technologies for obtaining those objectives. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The awarded contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities as required to meet the performance objectives of the Draft /Final SOO.</p>
<p>The period of performance (POP) - if all target options are executed - is estimated at 120 months from date of award. The estimated Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) anticipated for any resultant contract is between $30 Million and $37 Million. This ROM is an estimate range only and is provided only for informational purposes.</p>
<p>The following information is provided to assist potential offerors in planning for this requirement:</p>
<p>DRAFT Statement of Objectives (SOO), dated 29 May 2013; <br />DRAFT SOO Enclosure 1, Site List, dated 29 May 2013; <br />DRAFT SOO Enclosure 2, Key Documents List, dated 29 May 2013; <br />DRAFT SOO Enclosure 4, Acronyms and Definitions, dated 29 May 2013;<br />DRAFT Bonding Stream, dated 29 May 2013</p>
<p>A single repository site is available to review the key, installation-specific environmental documents listed in DRAFT SOO, Enclosure 2, Key Documents List. The following site is established to review back-ground information for the included sites:</p>
<p>https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B6RRVE2W7c46U1p0aEVPZEIyY2c/edit</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL INSURANCE (EI):&nbsp; &nbsp;The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.</p>
<p>BONDING CAPACITY:&nbsp; The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach.</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI):&nbsp; An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.</p>
<p>a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.</p>
<p>b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).</p>
<p>c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.</p>
<p>SITE VISIT INFORMATION:</p>
<p>A site visit has been scheduled for 13 June 2013 at Scott AFB, IL. It is the Air Force's intention to review general base information, site specific information, provide a walk-around of sites (all sites may not be viewed, but representative sites will be viewed). A schedule of events will be provided via email to firms that submit attendee information by the required time and date.</p>
<p>Currently, in order to meet time schedules, the Air Force is requesting that companies planning to send representatives to the Site Visit submit the names of the individuals attending. We can only accommodate two individuals per firm (Prime) and a maximum of two of their subcontractors. The names of interested parties will be added to a list of attendees. Each person attending the site visit will need to submit the following information to Laura.Stewart.1@us.af.mil and Daniel.Cevallos@us.af.mil no later than 2:00 p.m. (CT) on 06 June 2013. If this information is not submitted by the required time and date indicated above, your company will not be able to attend the site visit due to security concerns. There will be NO EXCEPTIONS:</p>
<p>1) Name and title of individual(s), including First and Last name<br />2) Daytime Phone Number of personnel attending site visit<br />3) Date of Birth<br />4) Driver's License #<br />5) State of issue for Driver's License<br />6) Company Name</p>
<p>ATTENDANCE AT THIS SITE VISIT IS NOT MANDATORY AND IS AT THE SOLE DISCRESTION OF EACH FIRM.&nbsp;&nbsp; THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT&nbsp;REIMBURSE PARTICIPATING&nbsp;FIRMS FOR SITE VISIT COSTS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offers, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>Posting	This Market Survey is issued In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) Paragraph 3.2.1.2.1 (Market Analysis), to determine whether adequate competition exists to conduct a full and open competition to meet the Voice Recorder Replacement Program (VRRP) fielding and support requirements from 2014-2017.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The Federal Aviation Administration is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

As FAA approaches the end of the VRRP fielding schedule, this requirement is for the procurement and installation of a small number (approximately 8) of standardized Digital Audio Legal Recorder (DALR) systems for new air traffic control towers currently under construction; and perform expansions of existing systems as required;.  The DOD (Air Force, Army and Navy) may order several systems depending on budget constraints.  The period of performance for this requirement is anticipated to be 3 years, from May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2017 with two one-year option periods exercisable entirely at the FAAs discretion.  The FAA currently has a contract with Nice Systems, Inc., to produce, install, train and sustain systems at FAA and DOD locations.  The current contract (DTFAWA-07-C-00029) was awarded to Nice Systems, Inc., Paramus, NJ, on April 30, 2007 following a full and open competition.  To date, 448 DALR systems have been delivered to the FAA and 227 DALR systems have been delivered to the DOD.

To successfully perform this requirement and minimize risk to the FAA, potential vendors must have:

1.  A voice recorder system that meets all the VRRP system Specification requirements (attached).

2.  A voice recorder system that has completed the FAAs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E), Independent Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) and In-Service Decision (ISD) review processes.

3.  A current production facility to produce the voice recorder systems in the quantities required.  

4.  An installation and training infrastructure and capability to support installation, checkout and acceptance requirements. 

5.  FAA approved technical documentation and training in place to support the VRRP.

6.  Record of recorder sales within the last 3 years that supports the presence of the proposed product in the marketplace. Including systems provided to the FAA and DOD. Vendors are also required to provide three (3) references that the FAA can contact to verify sales and performance of the product.  

Interested vendors must respond with a Capability Statement of experience and proven capabilities in meeting the above items and performing in an Air Traffic environment.  The Capability Statement must clearly demonstrate that the vendor has a VRRP Specification-conforming recording product and is capable of providing the required services.  The format for the Capability Statement is at the vendors' discretion, but no more than 20 pages including charts/diagrams.  Brochures and preexisting documentation will not be attributed to the 20 page count.  In order to be considered as an acceptable source, vendors must meet all the requirements listed in items 1 through 6 above.  Vendors that do not meet all the requirements listed in items 1 through 6 above will be determined to be unacceptable. 

For information planning purposes, a new voice recorder procurement termed the NAS Voice Recorder will be initiated in 2015 to acquire the next generation of voice recorders that will interface and be compatible with the NAS Voice System (NVS) NextGen program, which is currently entering its Demonstration phase.  The NAS Voice Recorder procurement will incorporate NextGen requirements and will undergo its Requirements Definition phase in the 2015-2016 timeframe.  Development and release of the Screening Information Request (SIR), evaluation of vendor proposals and testing of vendor equipment is projected to conclude with a source selection and contract award in 2017.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to the announcement.  Additionally, information provided in response to this announcement is for informational purposes only and will not be released.  If proprietary information is submitted it must be clearly marked in the responses.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Vendors believing they possess the capability to meet this requirement can respond to this announcement with your firms capabilities and experience.  Responses should be submitted no later than June 21, 2013, to Contracting Officer Charles McGovern via e-mail at: Charles.McGovern@faa.gov and Contract Specialist Dominic Lackey at dominic.lackey@faa.gov.
	
	The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited quotes or proposals.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY / CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR MULTIPLE-AWARDS, TO INCLUDE VARIOUS AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS MAINTENANCE FAMILIARIZATION TRAINING FOR FLIGHT STANDARDS AIRWORTHINESS INSPECTORS EMPLOYED BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA).  

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING SPECIALIST.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

This is a market survey for possible Multiple-Award aircraft systems maintenance training courses contracts for the aircraft listed (aircraft list attachment).   The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the responses to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.  

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) certified firms, and all other business types and sizes, capable of providing the specified training.  This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.  

In order to assist the FAA in determining capable sources for the required training, the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

1.  Capability Statement - This document should identify:
   Which aircraft respondents can provide systems familiarization training on and a detailed description of the courses in which they are capable of providing.   

2.  Geographic area where training will be provided and description of the training facility/classrooms.

3.  Expected approach - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

4. Questions/Comments regarding the Draft PWS.  

5. Completed Business Declaration Form

Attached is a list of the aircraft for which training is required and draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The FAA intends the procurement to result in multiple awards for the required training.  The interested vendors should provide documentation for each course they can provide.   The resulting awards will be on a class by class basis. The intended procurement vehicle(s) will be awarded as a base period of one year with two (2) one year options.  

   
All responses to this market survey must be received by 1:00 p.m. CST, 06/21/2013.  The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following:

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for an Optical Distributed Sensor Interrogator (ODiSI-B) fiber optic controller and data acquisition system. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Luna Technologies, Inc. NASA needs a fiber optic data acquisition system that will run without Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG's), will enable the use of commercial communications grade fiber optics, and will operate at 250 hertz or better.  The ODiSI-B from Luna Technologies, Inc. will meet these requirements. The capability of utilizing commercial communications grade fiber optics is necessary for cost control in the use of the technology where NASA intends to weave many fiber optic matrices into graphite fabrics for structural health monitoring and modal frequency assessments of composite structures.  The available alternative FBG systems would make this effort untenable, as the FBG system is incompatible with commercial communications grade fiber optics.  Luna Technologies, Inc. holds the patent and is the sole manufacturer and source of the ODiSI-B system. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 10, 2013.

The existing fused end silica must match new silica. The source elements are designed specifically to the CeramOptec Fused end silica dimensions. Other cables will not have the same throughput (or bundle fill factor) causing a loss of radiance in the source. Also, source elements are designed specifically to the CeramOptec Fused end silica dimensions.</p>
<p>Only Ceramoptec Industries, Inc can provide the Fused end silica replacement. There are no other re-sellers.</p>
<p><br />Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Sensor Sciences of Pleasant Hill, California for the refurbishment of a high resolution neutron imaging detector under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p><br />The Physical Measurement Laboratory at NIST owns a high resolution neutron imaging detector which was purchased in 2006 (SB1341-06-N-1440). The back micro-channel plate (MCP) and detector were manufactured by Sensor Sciences. Micro-channel plates (MCP plates) have a finite lifetime of approximately 1800 hours or one year.</p>
<p>A scheduled refurbishment of the high resolution neutron imaging detector is planned, which will ensure that downtime of the detector instrument is minimized. In this refurbishment, the back MCP plate along with related detector readout electronics will be replaced. The required components are manufactured by Sensor Sciences and are proprietary to Sensor Sciences.</p>
<p>The overall complexity of this high resolution neutron imaging detector necessitates an extremely detailed and intricate knowledge of the detector system and its components in order to effectively refurbish the instrument and restore it to OEM specifications.</p>
<p>Sensor Sciences is the only contractor who can provide the required refurbishment and proprietary parts for NIST's high resolution neutron imaging detector. The technology and parts for the system are proprietary, and are not available to other companies. No other vendor is authorized to refurbish, maintain, or service this Sensor Sciences instrument.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (Eastern) on June 13, 2013. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Contract award for schematic design and fundraising materials is anticipated in September 2013.</p>

<p>A fully completed Exhibit Design Qualification Statement Package (Part III) will be considered the company's Experience/Performance and will be evaluated solely to determine if the firm is to be Prequalified as follows:</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District Office requires a contract to create up to 12 acres of 3-dimensional sub tidal segmented reef with an overall average vertical structure crest height  greater than 2 ft above the bay bottom. The water depth at the project site varies somewhat and will be taken into account during final elevation certifications. Recent studies have demonstrated that oysters settle, survive and grow better on reefs with vertical structure and ecosystem services such as fish production (secondary productivity) is generally higher on such reefs. The ultimate construction design will attempt to maximize the colonization and growth of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) while simultaneously supporting colonization and use by other reef-dependant species such as shrimp, finfish, crabs, mussels, and other reef dwelling invertebrates. <br>  <br> A major barrier to large-scale oyster reef restoration is locating a source of oyster shell in large enough quantities to provide the needed topographic relief over significant areas. TNC proposes to use limestone, or limestone marl, for oyster reef restoration as a substitute for whole oyster shell for providing a reef-building substrate (cultch material) on which oyster spat can settle.  While oyster shell has historically been the preferred cultch material in reef restorations, several studies have identified other materials, such as limestone, limestone marl, and river rock that are just as effective as natural shell (Soniat et al 1991; Soniat and Burton 2005). While limestone is the preferred cultch material for this project, other suitable materials might be used depending on costs and availability at the time of construction.  Completion time is 240 calendar days.    <br>  <br> The Solicitation issued will be Firm Fixed Price contract.  The magnitude of this project is between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.  The Solicitation is 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The Solicitation will be issued on or about 21 May 2013.  Response date is 25 June 2013 @ 2:00 PM.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this project is 237990.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million .

The boat launch is used by USACE and other agencies for launching and retrieving trailer towed boats, and loading equipment onto a floating plant.  The boat launch is also made available for use by police, sheriff and fire departments. The existing launch will be renovated to provide a reinforced concrete and precast concrete ramp at the proper grade to facilitate launching and retrieving boats safely.  Dimensions of the renovated ramp including approach are approximately 12 ft wide by 110 ft long.  Approximately 120 cyd of river sediment will be removed to provide the appropriate grade for the renovated boat ramp.  A silt curtain will be placed around the area where sediment will be removed.  Removal of the sediment will occur when the river level is at elevation 17 or lower to minimize the work done beneath the water line.  Due to the presence of PCB's in the river, the sediment will be allowed to dry on site in a constructed containment area, then hauled and disposed of at a permitted landfill. <br>  <br> Site renovations will also include concrete pad work, site grading, drainage structures and paving work.  All work will be performed in compliance with the NYSDEC Water Quality Certification for the project.    <br>  <br> Potential contractors are encouraged to make a site visit.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR POTENTIAL OFFERORS. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Please reference Request for Proposal (RFP) number VA-791-13-R-0004. The Department of Veterans Affairs Denver Acquisition & Logistics Center (VA DALC), in support of the Veteran Health Administration, is intending to contract with qualified dental insurance carriers to administer and provide insurance coverage to eligible VA beneficiaries for VA's Dental Insurance Program (VADIP).

OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE: 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Health Eligibility Center (HEC), through the Denver Acquisition and Logistic Center (DALC) intends to contract with qualified dental insurance carriers to administer and provide insurance coverage to eligible VA beneficiaries for VA's Dental Insurance Program (VADIP). Coverage for VADIP dental services will be provided in the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

HEC serves as VA's national service center for VA health care registration, enrollment, and eligibility activities. HEC also serves as the business owner for administrative information systems supporting the delivery of VA health benefits.  HEC achieves VA's gold standard of honoring America's Veterans by providing accurate and timely health care eligibility and enrollment determinations and responsive and respectful customer service.

HEC supports VA's health care delivery system by providing centralized eligibility verification and enrollment processing services. HEC determines a Veteran's eligibility for VA health benefits and facilitates the enrollment process by providing guidance to VA field offices and facilities. HEC also collaborates with VA's Chief Business Office (CBO) and other administrative offices on the implementation of policy. 

Section 510 of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, Public Law Number (Pub. L. No.) 111-163, requires that VA carry out a dental pilot program, hereinafter referred to as VADIP, to assess the feasibility and advisability of a competitive, private, premium-based dental insurance plan for Veterans enrolled in VA health care and survivors and dependents of Veterans eligible for VA's Civilian Health and Medical Program (CHAMPVA).  Under the statute, VA will contract with private dental insurers to provide dental insurance coverage for VADIP beneficiaries. The contracted insurers shall also be responsible for administering various aspects of VADIP. VA's primary role in VADIP is administering the contracts with the private insurer(s) and providing the private insurer(s) with eligibility verification of individuals applying for VADIP coverage.

CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: 

Denver Acquisition and Logistic Center, 555 Corporate Circle, Golden, CO 80401. 

SOLICITATION DETAILS:

Public Law 111-163 dated May 5, 2010 mandates a pilot program for VA to provide a dental insurance plan to Veterans.  Since this contract will not have appropriated funding, it is a non-cost type contract.  As such, this procurement is not subject to the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  However, we will utilize numerous FAR provisions deemed appropriate and relevant to this solicitation.

The North American Classification Code is 524114 and the Small Business Size Standard is $7 Million.  This is a full and open procurement for any and all qualified, experienced, and knowledgeable business entity(s) who can meet the requirements.  The Government intends to award multiple fixed price with prospective price redetermination type contracts.  It will also be a "no-cost" Contract.

The contract period will be from the date of contract award through July 31, 2014, with two one-year options to be exercised at the discretion of the Government. 

Solicitation documents should be available electronically on June 3, 2013 at the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fbo.gov. NO HARD COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. The anticipated closing date is July 2, 2013 and anticipated award date is August 1, 2013. 

The Contracting Officer for this acquisition is Brian Turk. Offerors interested in responding to this solicitation should provide their email addresses and contact information to brian.turk@va.gov. The only terms and conditions that will apply to the solicitation and any resultant contracts shall come from the Contracting Officer through the release of the final RFP and any amendments, information received from other than the Contracting Officer to include other VA sources, are not binding on the VA.

NOTE:  Effective October 1, 2003, all contractors must be registered through the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website as an active contractor in order to be eligible to enter into a contract.  The CCR website is now part of the System for Award Management (SAM), which is found at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM.  Please be sure your company is registered at this website.  Prospective offerors should complete electronic annual representations and certifications, which is also part of the SAM.  Due to the limited time offerors have to respond you are encouraged, but not required, to register in advance.

The Center was developed with the ultimate purpose to improve the well-being, status, and understanding of Veterans in American society. The mandate called for a center of excellence that would set the agenda for research and education on PTSD without direct responsibility for patient care.  The National Center for PTSD manages the website www.ptsd.va.gov and has an educational mandate to educate clinicians, Veterans, and their families on PTSD.

Funds for a September 2013 award are not presently available. <br>  <br> PREPARATION & SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS   <br>  <br> Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.   <br>  <br> Proposals:  The proposal shall consist of two volumes, a technical volume and a cost volume.   In presenting the proposal material, prospective Offerors are advised that the quality of the information is significantly more important than quantity.  Offerors should confine the submissions to essential matters providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation.  If an Offeror wishes to propose multiple technologies and/or concepts, they should be included in a single proposal as the Government reserves the right to fund a proposal in whole or make a partial award. In such cases, cost proposals should be segregated by technology to support funding of partial awards. <br>  <br> PROPOSAL TECHNICAL VOLUME:  The technical volume of the proposal shall provide detail that justifies the benefits of the proposed technology relative to the topic objectives. The technical volume shall also include a clear statement of the technical objectives, the specific approach (including analysis tools) to be pursued and supporting background experience. It shall contain a Statement of Work (SOW), milestones, a biographical section describing key personnel, a description of the facilities and/or data sources to be employed in the effort, and a draft program management plan. Offerors shall identify and substantiate the beginning and ending Technology Readiness Levels.  <br>  <br> Volume I (Technical) shall be written and shall consist of a maximum of thirty pages exclusive of title page, section dividers, table of contents, list of figures/tables, glossary of terms, list of references, and cross-referencing indices.  The evaluators will read only up to the maximum number of pages specified. Submission shall be limited to the number of pages specified, total inclusive of any drawings, charts, etc.  Type shall be no smaller than a font size of ten (10) and shall be at least single spaced.  Page size shall not exceed 8   quote mark  x 11 quote mark .  Fold-out illustrations required for reader ease are allowed, however, illustration shall be counted in 8   quote mark  x 11 quote mark  increments (e.g., a 11 quote mark  x 17 quote mark  document will count as two pages).    <br>  <br> PROPOSAL COST VOLUME:  Within the Cost Proposal, offerors shall indicate the proposed funding instrument (e.g., FAR-based contract and type (cost-share, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost reimbursable, etc.) or TIA).  The Cost Proposal should include a funding profile (a cost breakout by month), cost breakdown providing man-hours with justification and monthly costs by task, all pricing rates used, travel and equipment and materials listings, if applicable. Subcontractor proposals, including pricing rate details, should be provided concurrent with the prime contractor's submission.  Any cost share will be calculated as follows: contractor cash plus in-kind contribution divided by project value.  Any resulting agreement value will exclude recipient's  quote mark sunk quote mark  costs of prior research as cost match. Only additional resources that will be provided by the recipient to carry out the current project will be counted.  This BAA includes a draft TIA available for offeror download.  If the offeror proposes use of a TIA, either as a Cooperative Agreement or OT, the offeror shall submit this draft TIA as part of the Cost Proposal with any changes it seeks marked with tracked changes.  Any proposed changes to the draft TIA will be included as part of discussions.   <br>  <br> SUBCONTRACTING PLAN:  Not applicable if proposing award under a non-FAR instrument (i.e. Technology Investment Agreement) or if the offeror is a SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN.  Pursuant to the requirements of FAR part 19.702(a)(1), if the total amount of the proposal exceeds $650,000, and there are subcontracting possibilities, offerors must submit a subcontracting plan.  FAR part 52.219-9 defines a subcontracting plan and its requirements.  Offerors shall incorporate the subcontracting plan as part of the offeror's proposal submission.  DFARS 226.370-8 discusses subcontracting incentive and goals with the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions.  DFARS 219.708(b)(1)(A) and (B), discusses the appropriate use of DFARS Clauses 252.219-7003 and 252.219-7004 in solicitations and contracts related to small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business subcontracting plans.  Offerors are cautioned that in solicitations where subcontracting opportunities exist, the Government will not execute a contract unless the Contracting Officer determines that the negotiated plan provides the maximum practicable opportunity for SBs, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and Veteran-owned Small Business concerns or HBCUs/MIs to participate in the performance of the contract.  Offerors should note that DFARS 219.705-4 provides for a goal of 5% for SDB concerns and HBCUs/MIs.   <br>  <br> EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD <br>  <br> The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  Each proposal will receive an adjectival rating supported by narrative.  The ratings/narrative will be used to develop an order of merit listing for each topic.  Proposed cost/cost to the Government will be evaluated as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness. <br>  <br>    The following evaluation criteria will apply:  <br>  <br> (1) Relevance of the Proposed Technologies.  This will include the benefits of the constituent rotors and VMS technologies, how they address the issues associated with improving performance, alleviating adverse forces, and improving capability in operational environments, and their technology readiness timeline. <br>  <br> 	(2) The Merit of the Proposed Technical Approach.

<DESC>This partnering synopsis solicits potential partners to form a Public Private Partnership (PPP) to implement an Advanced Composites Project (ACP) within NASAs Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate.  The ACP is an effort involving NASA, other Government agencies, industry and universities to accelerate the insertion of composite materials and structures into aeronautics vehicles. The goal of the project is to reduce significantly the time for development, verification, and regulatory acceptance of new composite materials and structures.  In the broadest sense, its purpose is to streamline the development and use of composites from test tube to vehicles.  The partners selected based on this synopsis will collaborate with NASA to develop a Collaboration Agreement governing an Advanced Composites Consortium (ACC) as a Public Private Partnership (PPP). The ACC will address and fund research and technology development needs of NASA and industry related to certification processes, procedures and tools to support integration of advanced composite materials into the next generation of vehicle systems. While the ACC schedule cannot be fully specified at this time, the following is an estimated schedule (dates are subject to change): NASA Langley Research Center selects partner(s) in response to this announcement  60 days following issuance of synopsis. NASA Langley Research Center signs MOU with selected partner(s) and, upon selection, NASA Langley Research Center and Partners complete development of the Collaboration Agreement for the Advanced Composites Consortium NLT 30 Sep 2013.  Participation in this partnering synopsis is open to all U.S. industry, including not-for-profit institutions, that can demonstrate the capabilities identified in Section 2.0 below, particularly the ability to contribute significant cost share to efforts within the ACC that may be partially funded by NASA (in general a 50/50 cost sharing is desired between NASA and the non-government ACC members). For those entities that cannot demonstrate the capabilities identified in Section 2.0 below, opportunities for participation may be made available by NASA in other forms, such as via NASA Research Announcement (NRA) opportunities, at a later date after the ACC is established.  Additionally, NASA may open membership in the ACC at a later time to include additional organizations beyond those selected in response to this synopsis. Terms under which new organizations might join the ACC will be indicated in the Collaboration Agreement. 1.0 Teaming Opportunity.  This Teaming Opportunity is being issued to select partner(s) to engage in mutually beneficial, cooperative activities supporting the goals and missions of the ACP.  The selected partners will collaborate with each other and with other interested government parties to develop a Collaboration Agreement that will govern how the parties to the ACC identify and perform research and development requirements in support of the ACP and how ACC members will provide funding and in-kind contributions in support of ACP research and development activities of mutual interest. In addition, the Collaboration Agreement will address terms for consortium membership, and identify terms and conditions that will apply to research and development conducted by the ACC (e.g., intellectual property rights).	It is anticipated that this Collaboration Agreement will be developed during Fiscal Year 2013.  During the establishment of the Collaboration Agreement, it is anticipated that one industry partner will be identified by the members to serve an additional duty as Integrator (administrator, not leader) for the ACC. Subsequent to establishment of the Collaboration Agreement, NASA anticipates developing and executing a cooperative agreement with the identified partner to administer some activities of the ACC, e.g. meeting/ communication facilitation and fund management between NASA and all other ACC partners. 2.0 Required Capabilities.  In their responses to this synopsis potential partners must demonstrate sufficient expertise, experience, funding capability and willingness to collaborate to develop a Collaboration Agreement at no cost to NASA as indicated in the criteria below.  Partner selections will be made by an evaluation team organized by Langley Research Center based on the following criteria in order of importance: (1) Technical Expertise. The proposer shall describe and demonstrate the extent of its technical expertise in design and manufacture of composites for aerospace applications. (2) Funding. The proposer shall describe the extent of its willingness and ability to engage in cost sharing on collaborative research projects undertaken by the ACC. (3) Certification Experience.  The proposer shall describe and demonstrate the extent of its experience in successfully certifying aeronautics vehicles or components that include composites with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or Department of Defense (DoD) certification offices. (4) Focus Technology Experience.

<p>Synopsis: Sources Sought</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice intended for small business only. This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting Market Research for the purpose of identifying small business who have demonstrated capabilities in the area of Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. No solicitation of offers is made by this synopsis.</p>
<p><br />Background:<br />The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC)/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Environment Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) manages NOAA's Polar Satellite HRPT Image Processing Systems (HIPS) at the National Weather Service regional office in Monterey, CA for the continued reception and processing of NOAA HRPT and METOP HRPT (MHRPT). The existing Monterey L-Band antenna system has reached the end of its serviceable life and is in need of replacement, and upgrades along with four (4) additional HIPS stations: Guam, Miami, San Juan, Puerto Rico and the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF). The Monterey site shall require the removal of the existing antenna. The procurement and installation of antenna mounting pads or roof top mounting anchoring hardware at sites requiring these items will be the responsibility of the Government.<br />The National Weather Service Alaska and Pacific Regions currently operate HIPS stations for the reception and processing of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite (POES) data. These systems are capable of ingesting and processing Direct Broadcast (DB) data from NOAA POES and Metop satellites. The HIPS Earth Station at Monterey includes a 1.77-meter tracking antenna, integrated LNA/Feed and down converter, HRPT/MHRPT receiver, and dual channel HRPT/MHRPT bit/frame synchronizer. Both the HRPT/MHRPT receivers and the HRPT/MHRPT bit/frame synchronizer reside in an external chassis, which connects to a Hewlett Packard UNIX RISC workstation via SCSI. The HIPS systems generate geolocation files and data products in a proprietary HIPS binary, flat-file format. The SOW is only for L-Band reception and HRPT/MHRTP processing upgrades to the Monterey HIPS site. The SOW is for a new L-Band reception and processing systems. As mentioned above an option is to be quoted for X-Band reception and processing.</p>
<p>Requirements:<br />NESDIS requires Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing for the hardware, software, and engineering services, which are required to upgrade the L-Band data reception and processing systems at the Monterey HIPS station. The contractor shall quote the basic portion is the SOW for continued data stream reception and processing from the NOAA POES and Metop satellites (HRPT and MHRPT respectively). As an option to the SOW, the contractor shall quote the reception of X-Band data from National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Preparatory Project (NPP) and Global Change Observation Mission (GCOM) W1. Also, as an option to the SOW is the upgrade to four (4) additional HIPS stations: Guam, Miami, San Juan, Puerto Rico and the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF). As part of the SOW options, the contractor shall provide radomes for the installed antennas at the above HIPS sites for protection from the elements.

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS SOL-CI-13-00032 Implementation of the Public Water Systems Supervision (PWSS) and Underground Injection Control (UIC) Programs
THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a ?market research? survey for large and small businesses in preparation for a future procurement.
The EPA, Office of Water?s Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW) is in need of contractor support for the implementation of regulations and other implementation activities as they relate to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).  Specifically the Safe Drinking Water Act mandates the EPA establish national drinking water standards for public water systems to assure water supplied to the public is safe to drink.  In addition the SDWA requires EPA to establish and implement regulations for the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program to safeguard sources of drinking water.  The Act envisions a join Federal/State program to assure compliance with all standards.  Congress has intended that the States take a lead role in the primary enforcement responsibility (primacy) for both programs.
Activities in support of this requirement may include the following: -providing technical support for development and revision of standards and rulemakings pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) -provide recommendations on methodologies for meeting analytical requirements for contaminant monitoring -convene technical panels/meetings to discuss context of various rulemaking, to share data and analysis, and to solicit comment on regulatory options -collect and analyze information and comments in support of Agency?s public notification and public hearing requirements for rule development -develop regulatory support materials -conduct reviews/analysis/assessments on State enforcement of SDWA regulations and programs -conduct assessments/analysis of State UIC programs -conduct on-site visits to public water systems and UIC wells to develop national statistics, assess compliance and identify compliance trends -conduct sanitary surveys, Comprehensive Performance Evaluations and Inspections -prepare reports on compliance status and trends, and enforcement actions relative to the SDWA -provide expert assistance/testimony in EPA enforcement cases (financial and technical analyses) -evaluate qualifications of prospective laboratories in support of Laboratory Certification Program -conduct Comprehensive Performance Evaluations in support of Regional, State and Area Wide Optimization Programs -reviewing public water system plans and specifications -Review, adapt, develop, or utilize environmental and general hydrologic and fluid flow modeling techniques to specific ground water problems -issue paper development pursuant to the SDWA -conduct peer reviews of documents -support for the development, implementation and evaluation of the State Revolving Fund (SRF) program at the Federal level and in all participating States. -in support of the SRF assess and document program compliance with Federal regulatory requirements and program performance -review/analyze/recommend capacity development and operator certification -assess small business viability and ability to implement drinking water regulations -review of ground water sources of drinking water to determine direct influence of surface water as required by the Surface Water Treatment Rule -assist in incorporating Source Water Protection (SWP) into Federal and State regulatory financial planning and outreach programs -Underground Injection Control (UIC) No-Migration Petition Support -information management -survey/information collection -analyze and study surveys and study results -information data base maintenance support -preliminary training/meeting support/outreach and communication report -training and presentation materials development -Primary Technical Support (assist states, tribes, and owner operators of municipal water systems to adopt sustainable management systems for managing PWSS and UIC Programs)
In keeping with the potential tasks, contractors submitting capabilities statements should address their ability to provide or have access to senior technical experts in: developing and revising standards and rulemakings pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); providing recommendations on methodologies for meeting analytical requirements for contaminant monitoring; expertise in convening technical panels/meetings to discuss context of various rulemaking, to share data and analysis, and to solicit comment on regulatory options; analyze information and comments in support of Agency?s public notification and public hearing requirements for rule development; conducting reviews/analysis/assessments on State enforcement of SDWA regulations and programs; expertise in assessments/analysis of State UIC programs; Senior technical expertise in providing expert assistance/testimony in EPA enforcement cases (financial and technical analyses), conducting Comprehensive Performance E valuations in support of Regional, State and Area Wide Optimization Programs; and expertise in the development, implementation and evaluation of the State Revolving Fund (SRF) program at the Federal and State level.
The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor materials, facilities, and services in support of the efforts.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) starting in January 2015 with a one (1) year Base Period and six (6) year Optional Periods of 12 months each.  Approximately 65,000 LOE hours are anticipated for each contract period with contractor?s needing to provide as much as an additional 130,000 hours a year for a total of 1,365,000 hours in total for all periods if all the potential LOE hours are realized.  The applicable NAICS code is 541611with a size standard of $14,000,000.
No firms are restricted from submitting a proposal.  The Agency recognizes that there exists a need for firms to gain the requisite experience necessary to fulfill the requirements of the proposed contract and that such experience is often gained through provision of consulting or related technical services to various firms.  Accordingly, firms who may have an actual or potential conflict of interest (COI) will be required to certify in a disclosure statement their efforts to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate a COI, and allow the Agency to assess any vulnerabilities related to COI prior to awarding a contract.  Please see attached draft COI clauses which includes the areas in which firms may have significant potential organizational conflict of interest requiring specific disclosure.
Any interested firms should submit a capability statement which demonstrates the firm?s ability to perform the key requirements described above.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.  Capability statements are limited to 10 pages in length, no smaller than 12 point Font.  In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code (i.e., large, small) and whether or not they are certified HubZone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran own concern.
The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small business if it determines that there are two or more small businesses able to compete in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery.  If set aside, a small business would be required to perform at least 51 percent of the direct labor costs incurred under the contract with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14).  Capability statements from small businesses should address their ability to meet this requirement.  Responses to the above should be submitted to Courtney Stallworth, at Stallworth.courtney@epa.gov no later than 21 calendar days from date of this posting.  A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources sought synopsis.
The EPA is also interested in soliciting ideas that firms may have as to the appropriate means of incentivizing contractor performance from a contractor?s perspective.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT
<p>This sources sought notice is issued for information purposes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not intend to award a contract solely on the basis of this notice. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the SEC to solicit or award a contract now or in the future or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Respondents shall be responsible for all costs associated with the information submitted in response to this notice. The SEC is seeking interested sources for a possible future solicitation. At this time, no solicitation exists. Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify sources that can provide data in an electronic structured format on merger or acquisition announcements involving companies with securities traded in U.S. markets. All large and small businesses capable of providing such data are encouraged to respond to this notice. This includes, Small Business (SB), Veteran-Owned (VOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOB), HUBZone, Woman-Owned (WOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned (EDWOSB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), and Section 8(a) small business concerns.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Division of Enforcement was created in August 1972 to consolidate enforcement activities that previously had been handled by the various operating divisions at the Commission's headquarters in Washington. The Commission's enforcement staff conducts investigations into possible violations of the federal securities laws, and prosecutes the Commission's civil suits in the federal courts as well as its administrative proceedings. <br />In civil suits, the Commission seeks injunctions, which are orders that prohibit future violations; a person who violates an injunction is subject to fines or imprisonment for contempt. In addition, the Commission often seeks civil money penalties and the disgorgement of illegal profits. The courts may also bar or suspend individuals from acting as corporate officers or directors. <br />The Commission can bring a variety of administrative proceedings, which are heard by administrative law judges and the Commission itself. One type of proceeding, for a cease and desist order, may be instituted against any person who violates the federal securities laws. The Commission may order the respondent to disgorge ill-gotten funds in these proceedings. With respect to regulated entities (e.g., brokers, dealers and investment advisers) and their employees, the Commission may institute administrative proceedings to revoke or suspend registration, or to impose bars or suspensions from employment. <br />For more information about the Division of Enforcement please visit, http://sec.gov/divisions/enforce.shtml</p>
<p>The Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation (RSFI) was created in September 2009 to integrate financial economics and rigorous data analytics into the core mission of the SEC. The Division is involved across the entire range of SEC activities, including policy-making, rule-making, enforcement, and examination. As the agency's "think tank," RSFI relies on a variety of academic disciplines, quantitative and non-quantitative approaches, and knowledge of market institutions and practices to help the SEC approach complex matters in a fresh light. RSFI also assists in the SEC's efforts to identify, analyze, and respond to risks and trends, including those associated with new financial products and strategies. Through the range and nature of its activities, RSFI serves the critical function of promoting collaborative efforts throughout the agency and breaking through silos that might otherwise limit the impact of the agency's institutional expertise. For more information about RSFI please visit,<br />http://sec.gov/divisions/riskfin.shtml</p>

<DESC>A Market Survey is being conducted to determine if there are interested and qualified Large Business, Small Business, HUBZone small business, 8(a) small business, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business contractors for the following proposed project:  Provide accurate forecasts of military personnel housing requirements at selected U.S. Army installations, worldwide. The Army uses the Housing Market Analysis (HMA) process to project the requirement for Army-provided Family Housing (FH) based upon the total projected military population, demographics found in that population, economic conditions, and generalized human behavior in response to changes in the local housing market in each local community. The HMA will focus on private-sector rental housing that will likely be available to military personnel in the market area. The contractor shall comprehensively evaluate dynamic forces affecting private sector housing supply and demand. This is to assess the private sector's ability to provide adequate support of the housing needs of accompanied and unaccompanied personnel stationed at the installation. The forecast will be five years from the present time. The primary study product will be a printed report documenting the findings and detailing the process, including assumptions, data sources, and step-by-step results. The Army will require this report in electronic format, and backup data used to produce the report in electronic format. The reports and backup data become the property of the Army upon final delivery. <br>  <br> The HMA process models the behavior of most of the permanent-party U.S. military personnel, as if those military members were competing for the available private sector housing. If the model indicates that some military members are unable to find safe, affordable, and convenient housing in the private sector, then those military members become part of the final housing requirement. The Army will identify some military members to be excluded from competing for private sector rental housing, because they are homeowners, or they were in the 'floor requirement' that the Army will define. To be considered adequate, private sector housing must be: within a reasonable commute of the site; affordable for military personnel; acceptable in quality; and, have the proper number of bedrooms given household size and military paygrade. The contractor personnel will make a week-long site visit to the Army site; coordinate meetings with Army personnel; hold in-person and electronic interviews with knowledgeable community professionals; and, collect data on site and electronically. <br>  <br> The Army will make available Army and Department of Defense (DoD) policies that apply. The Army will provide current and projected military population, and some demographic information; the contractor is expected to obtain added demographic data from defense and open sources. The Army will provide information, including: housing allowances; list of Key & Essential (K&E) personnel; occupancy of all Army housing; locations where military personnel reside; waiting time for Army housing; Army housing inventory in detail and projected changes to it; and, points of contact on those knowledgeable regarding private sector housing and community issues. Also, the Army will provide names of installation personnel available for interview, their contact information, and make these individuals available during normal business hours.  <br>  <br> The contractor will need to use economic modeling and must be familiar with economic modeling in the context of housing. The Army does not have a specific model and will not provide one. The contractor will have to collect information on current local conditions and market trends in person and from electronic sources. The Army will not identify all of these sources. At most Army locations, there have been prior HMA studies and the Army will provide the most recent report for a contracted site.  <br>  <br> This will be an unclassified contract, and there will be no need for any contractor employees to have any access to classified information. The contractor's employees must have a Common Access Card (CAC) or be able to present the required information documentation to obtain one from the Army. The contractor and its employees shall comply with Personal Identity Verification (PIV) procedures implemented by Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201-1, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidance M-05-24. Contractor employees may not start work until the contractor submits appropriate personnel security investigation (PSI) paperwork to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and receive a favorable interim eligibility/suitability. Contractor employees not meeting the minimum requirements will then be subjected to check by the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). Persons who are not U.S. citizens may not work on this contract unless the contractor meets the provisions of Army Regulation 25-2, 'Information Assurance.' Any subcontractors are likewise bound. <br> Contract duration is estimated to be five (5) years from the date of award consisting of a three (3) year base period plus a two (2) year option period.  The estimated cost range is $3,000,000 over a period of five (5) years.  NAICS is 541611. Size limitation is $14 M. All interested Large Business, Small Business, HUBZone small business, 8(a) small business, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business contractors should notify this office in writing by mail on or before 14 June 2013 at 10:00am EST. Responses should include: (1) Identification as a Large Business or Small Business or verification of the company by the Small Business Administration, as either a certified HUBZone, certified 8(a), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, (2) Resumes which document the contractor's relevant education, experience, training, special skills, licenses, certifications, professional registration information and any respective performance related documentation, (3) Demonstration that the contractor has the capacity to accomplish the work for approximately 7-10 sites (per task order) within a 12 month timeframe, (4) Descriptions of projects substantially complete or completed within the last five years which are similar to this project in scope, (5) A statement of which portion of the work that will be self performed and how it will be accomplished. Send responses to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, 600 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Place, Room 821, Attn: Lauren Minzenberger, Louisville, KY 40202-2267 or lauren.o.minzenberger@usace.army.mil.

OBJECTIVE: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking potential sources capable of providing Point of Use (POU) system(s) with supporting integration services to Medical Centers (MCs) and affiliated Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) throughout the Veterans Health Administration.

The system(s), equipment, training and supporting services include, but are not limited to, supply/delivery of POU system to approximately 20-30 pilot MCs in FY14.  The system will be required to communicate with existing VHA systems and/or with the MC's Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor.  The installation, service, maintenance, and training must be comprehensive and include all aspects of the proposed system(s) and their relationship to current VHA systems, policies, and procedures.  The training should include a robust repository of materials designed to facilitate continued internal training by VHA personnel throughout the lifecycle of the POU system(s) proposed.

The geographical boundaries for these pilots would likely be within the East, Central, or Western regions of the United States.  The pilots are not envisioned to encompass more than one of these regions.  However, the POU system, integration, and training support must be capable of being duplicated throughout the VHA network. This Request for Information could be used to determine systems, ideas, and innovations.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Motion Picture Cans<br />RQ LSC20130032/COR: DRAFT
<p>Background<br />The Moving Image Section requires regular purchase of conservation quality motion <br />Picture film cans for acetate and polyester-based motion picture film. These cans must be ventilated, to ensure proper airflow inside the can, preventing acetic acid buildup, which increases the rate of acetate film decay. They also prevent chemical reactivity between the film material and its housing. The cans help to ensure Library of Congress safety stock motion picture materials are optimally stored, so the rate of decay will be as slow as possible. This allows our material to be preserved and accessed by members of Congress and the public long into the future, in service of the Library's Mission.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:<br />The Moving Image Section of the Library of Congress wishes to purchase 7,050 conservation quality plastic motion picture film cans, each capable of storing 2000 feet of 35mm film. These items will be used to house motion picture film (acetate and polyester) material in the vaults as part of conservation stabilization efforts.</p>
<p>Requirements:<br />&bull; 35mm film cans must adhere to the following specifications with the exception of flame retardant. Flame retardant is not required in this particular SOW.<br />http://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/specifications/specs/800-852_11.pdf</p>
<p>&bull; Cans must feature interlocking lids, with a sidewall that reaches close to the bottom of the can (must cover 80% of can sidewall) to ensure that Product Requirement II.A.2. (Construction), regarding lid fit, is met.</p>
<p>&bull; Cans must stack five-high at a height no greater than 8 11/16" to ensure fit on Packard Campus shelving</p>
<p>&bull; Cans must feature Library of Congress logo<br /><br />Deliverables:<br />Contractor will deliver seven thousand and fifty (7,050) conservation cans meeting the above requirements. They must be sized to hold two thousand feet of 35mm film. Freight and/or shipping costs shall be included in the contract price.<br /><br /><strong>The Library of Congress intends to issue this requirement described above as a sole source order to Media Distributors. Any firm that wishes to be considered for this requirement must submit a capability statement that demonstrates its ability to meet all of the requirements of the work described in the attached draft Statement of Work</strong></p>

<DESC><p>Opportunity Notice for Parties Interested in Partnering with NETL under FOA No. DE-FOA-0000805</p>
<p>The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) has a 100 year history of fossil energy research and expertise in experimentation and modeling in energy conversion, thermal management, and ancillary operations related to power production and utilization. The NETL is interested in submitting an application to the Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Office in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number DE-FOA-0000805, "Concentrating Solar Power: Efficiently Leveraging Equilibrium Mechanisms for Engineering New Thermochemical Storage (CSP: ELEMENTS)", an effort to develop thermal energy storage systems for large-scale solar power installations. The estimated total value of this effort will be $1,200,000, with 20% of that, or $200,000, required to come from cost-shared funds. Parties interested in obtaining additional information regarding NETL's proposed approach to thermochemical storage are required to submit the attached non-disclosure agreement.</p>
<p>The NETL is seeking project partners that can contribute technical experience, services, or equipment to meet the mandatory 20% minimum cost-share to qualify for support of the research effort to be conducted under the EERE FOA. Cost-share can be in the form of cash and/or in-kind contributions. Allowable in-kind contributions include but are not limited to personnel costs, rental value of building or equipment or the value of a service or other resource. Qualified candidate partners are required to have a minimum of 5 years experience with solar power plants and gas turbine technology and provide evidence of prior experience in partnering with federal agencies. Candidate partners will be required to contribute their expertise in developing a techno-economic assessment of NETL's approach to thermochemical storage, as well as provide insight on how the concept could be implemented in a commercial design.</p>
<p>Qualified candidates interested in partnering with NETL under the EERE FOA and able to meet the cost share requirement are invited to email a submittal to NETL no later than 8:00 AM EDT June 10, 2013 (email address identified below). The submittal shall not exceed 3 pages in length and shall include the following: a)no more than a 2-page technical discussion addressing the requirements described above, a description of their overall commercial interest in thermochemical storage, and a description of relevant experience, key personnel, and facilities and equipment that might be utilized; and b) less than 1-page budget summarizing the overall proposed project cost contribution with clear delineation of the allowable cost-share components.</p>
<p>Submittals will be evaluated on (1) technical understanding of the requirements for energy storage systems, (2) qualifications and experience of proposed key personnel, (3) organizational and management experience, including teaming, and (4) adequacy and feasibility of the proposed budget. Each criterion will carry equal weight. The selection decision will be based on overall best value.</p>
<p>The NETL will incorporate the information from the partner it intends to use as part of NETL's application to EERE under the FOA described above. The NETL will not enter into a partnership arrangement unless and until NETL is selected for a reimbursable work opportunity by EERE under the FOA described above. NETL is not responsible for costs incurred by prospective partners in preparation of their submittals to NETL. <br /><br />Submittals are due not later than 8:00 AM EDT June 10, 2013 and shall be submitted to the email address below. It is anticipated that the selected partner will be notified by 8:00 PM EDT Monday June 17, 2013.</p>

<DESC>NUMBER: 	PR: 0040086003 POSTED DATE: 	05/30/2013 SUBJECT:	Wood Gasification/Oil Boiler Model - E100 This announcement constitutes the only notice. This is not a request for quotes. A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Responses must be received no later than Wednesday June 5, 2013, by sending an e-mail to almeda_gaddis@fws.gov; however, any technical data received will be for the sole purpose of market research for future requirements. Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Fish & Wildlife Services, Region 7 Contracting and General Services intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price order to: COMPANY:	Alternate Heating Systems, LLC  DUNS: 964342732 FOR :	Wood Gasification/Oil Boiler Model  E100 for Koyukuk/Nowitna NWR ON:	06/05/2013 NAICS:	333414	Heating Equipment AUTHORITY:	8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval 13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency. Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because: Koyokuk/Nowitna NWR requires a wood-gasification/oil fired combination boiler for Quarters #8 which has anominal max BTUs of 100k, water capacity of 60 gals, oil combination switch-over option, depth of boiler and minimum clearance of 80 or more inches when combined, can accept up to 28 inch log, have a burn chamber fuel capacity of 6.5 cu ft. flue connector diameter of 6", and domestic hot water coil available. The other quarters have been upgraded over the past few years using this extremely energy efficient system due to rising energy costs.  Quarters #8; is currently using an older, less efficient version of the boiler system we are seeking.  This boiler will allow the home owner to use firewood, in an extremely efficient manner, but can switch automatically over to heating fuel if should the occupant be unable to load the stove.  
A major consideration on this purchase regarding this particular preferred vendor is keeping continuity for our maintenance parts inventory since we have 6 other boilers that match. Our maintenance staff is familiar with the product and pleased with its efficiency and performance to date.  The installation process is familiar to the maintenance crew and problems that arose during installation of the first 6 boilers have been determined and overcome.  A different system, if located, would come with new installation challenges.  This is a bigger problem in the rural areas where access to hardware stores is not possible other than mail order.  Additionally, this boiler is specific for homes with limited space.

<DESC>The goal of the field sterilizer program is to test and evaluate a readily available modernized steam sterilizer with improved sterilization effectiveness that meets the needs of field hospitals.  The sterilizer will be an electrically operated, large chamber steam sterilizer for use in (1) the Central Materiel Section of Combat Support Hospitals (CSHs) to sterilize supplies (e.g., surgical instruments, dressings) used in surgical procedures and other casualty care in the operating room, emergency treatment area, and intensive care units, and (2) the Area Medical Laboratory (AML) to sterilize pathological specimens prior to disposal. Modernization features will include a vacuum cycle and electronic controls for automatic sequencing of sterilizer controls and recording of process conditions.  The Steam Sterilizer, Field Portable (SSFP) is to be used by field medical treatment facilities and therefore must be rugged enough to withstand the rigors of deployment and a variety of austere locations and environments in addition to meeting performance characteristics required in fixed facilities.  The sterilizer must be cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enable use in hospitals.  This will require Boiler and Pressure Vessel certification of the sterilizer design and manufacturing facility by the American Society for Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(2), with Infectious Diseases Institute Limited in Kampala, Uganda for purchase of services involving logistical, professional and administrative support to USAMRIID for conduct of clinical research and delivery of training in recognition, diagnosis and management of biological casualties to Ugandan health care providers.   The award will be firmed fixed, for a base year and 4 optional year of service.  IDI has the unique experience required to leverage their experience in working with key Ugandan government, professional and academician officials to assist USAMRIID with designing and delivering a self-sustaining training product tailored specifically to the needs of the Ugandan health care professionals. IDI has an extensive network of relationships with the Ugandan Ministry of health, directors of Ugandan medical professional organizations, the medical school dean and leading faculty at Makerere University. IDI is co-located with the Makerere University School of Medicine, which is critical as this is the key training site for training of trainers and the School must approve the training curriculum.  Any site farther away than 25 kilometers is unacceptable as transportation and telephone lines are unreliable.  IDI has the experience and training which affords leverage of tapping into seasoned academic resources at the Makerere University and Mulago hospital.  Other companies would require substantial time to establish themselves in the highly political and cultural atmosphere currently in place in the Ugandan health care systems.  Such time would be costly and exceed the present budget allotted to USAMRIID for this effort.  The services provided my MUWRP/ IDI are unique and do not occur elsewhere by other entities operating in Uganda. There are no other known comparable organizations in Uganda with the type of experience and track record with the Makerere University College of Health Sciences and Infectious Diseases Institute.  The requirement is time sensitive as the projects are ongoing and the present period of performance has tight deadlines.  <br> No solicitation package will be issued.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement. <br>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Exradin chambers have been used at NIST for many years as a reference class transfer standard. These Exradin chambers will be used as replacements to chambers that are currently used for our proficiency test program. The Exradin chamber design is the only type of chamber that will meet the needs of the NIST X-ray and gamma-ray facilities. Expertise has been developed using these chambers and extensive response histories have been accumulated. At this time, no other model can be substituted for these chambers, since the design is unique for the required use at NIST.</p>

<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The measurement of mass in a vacuum environment is critical for support of the experiments involved in the redefinition of the unit of mass, the kilogram. The watt balance experiment (performed at NIST) and the International Avogadro Coordination project will, for the first time in history, define the unit of mass in terms of the Planck constant, an invariant of nature. However, both experiments will take place in a vacuum environment. In order to disseminate the kilogram to the outside world, the physical effects, i.e., the gain and loss of mass due to moving a mass artifact in and out of a vacuum environment must be quantified. The requested system is required in support of a broader NIST program in the Quantum Measurement Division that will a) measure mass in terms of the Planck constant (watt balance); b) develop models for an artifact's change in mass when going in and out of a vacuum environment (mass in vacuum system being requested); c) dissemination of the Planck constant-based kilogram from vacuum to air via a magnetic levitation mass comparison system (currently under development). A critical part of this program is the procurement of a self-contained, high precision mass-in-vacuum system for quantifying the effects of atmospheric contaminants on metallic mass standards.</p>

Instructions to offerors for quotation submission
Responsibility and Inspection: Unless otherwise specified in the order, the contractor is responsible for the
performance of all inspection requirements and quality control.

Evaluation Factors: Quotes will be evaluated based on technical acceptability, price and past performance.
 Therefore, quote submissions shall consist of three parts: (1) Technical Submission, (2) Price Quote and (3) Past Performance. 

The Contracting Officer will rank offerors from lowest to highest price, review the technical proposal of the lowest price offeror, and, if that offer is technically acceptable, make the award without further evaluating the technical proposals of the other offerors. Additionally, in determining overall proposal pricing, the contracting officer will add the prices for CLINs 1, 2, 3 and 4 where the CLIN 4 price will be the aggregate of all repair and replacement price list item prices. The contracting officer will review repair and replacement item pricing to ensure the proposed pricing is not unbalanced.

1.
 Technical Submission. Technical Submissions must be submitted addressing all criteria listed below. These criteria, which will be used in evaluating proposals, are of equal importance. At a minimum the Technical Submission Narrative with attachments, must include:
	(1) Demonstration of Offerors ability to meet all Performance Requirements outlined in the
	Performance Work Statement (PWS) starting with 3.0 to 3.9 with special attention to addressing
	the items in the Service Performance Requirements Summary.
	(2) Meet all Contractor Qualifications as outlined PWS in items 7.0 to7.5.	
	(3) Manufacturers certificates of qualifications for work on Lion, Globe and Morning Pride
	FFPE and IEE gear.
	(4) Proof of commercial liability insurance.
The Government will evaluate the Technical Submission as acceptable (pass) or unacceptable (fail).

Pass: The quote contains all of the required Technical Submission information indicated in the solicitation and
PWS, the information submitted does not conflict with the requirements of the Specifications herein, and the
proposed items meet or exceed the Governments requirements.

Fail: The quote does not contain all of the required Technical Submission information indicated in the
solicitation, and/or the information submitted conflicts with the requirements of the Specifications herein, and/or
the proposed items do not meet the Governments requirements.

Note: If the Contracting Officer determines that a vendors technical submission is unacceptable, that vendors
entire submittal may be determined to be technically unacceptable and may no longer be considered for further
competition or award.
 

2. Price. The vendor shall submit one price quote. Prices for all line items shall be provided. The Offeror
shall address the method(s) used to establish any discount terms provided to the Government. Price quotes shall
be held firm for thirty days. 

Vendors are advised that $8,500 is the maximum aggregate expenditure for CLIN 0004 for the initial term and $15,000 is the maximum for each of the option years. That is, the Federal Fire Department intends to pay for only those repairs actually requested and performed up to the total maximum expenditure for all repairs ordered during each performance period. Vendors who exceed those amounts, without written authorization from the contracting officer, do so at their own risk.
 The Government makes no representation as to the actual dollar amount of repairs which might be ordered in the original term or in any option year.

3. Past Performance. Past Performance will be based on data retrieved from The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov 

Submission of quotes: All interested bidders shall submit quotations electronically through email to donna.franzese@navy.mil  The submitter should confirm receipt of email submissions. Please note that quotes over 25 pages in total will not be accepted. For questions please contact Donna Franzese at 808-473-7545

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

The following factors, listed in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers:
1. Price 2. Delivery 3. Past Performance 4. Technical Specifications
Price, when combined, are significantly more important than delivery. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

FAR subpart 39 requires that, in accordance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), requiring and ordering activities must ensure EIT supplies or services meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36 CFR Part 1194, unless an exception applies. The Department of State requiring official has documented in writing, in accordance with FAR 39.204, an exception to the requirements for accessibility, since the required EIT ? [ ] Is for a national security system; [ ] Is acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract; [ X ] Is located in spaces frequented only by service personnel for maintenance, repair or occasional monitoring of equipment; or [ ] Would impose an undue burden on the agency. Therefore, the requirements of FAR 39.203 do not apply to this EIT acquisition. <BR> <BR>

<p>The USAID Kyrgyz Republic Mission (USAID/KR) is headquartered in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic, a sub-office in Osh, Kyrgyz Republic. The Kyrgyz Republic is bordered by Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. The Kyrgyz Republic is an emerging parliamentary democracy still recovering from a violent political transition in 2010. Because it serves as a potential model for democracy in the region, and because of its proximity to South Asia and its potential to contribute to stability in nearby Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Kyrgyz Republic is of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government's program of assistance in the Kyrgyz Republic is focused on the growth of diversified enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare and education services. The mission manages over $50 million in assistance funds annually. The Mission implements its programs together with more than 30 contractor and grantee teams.</p>
<p>The Mission currently has three technical offices: the Economic Development Office (EDO), the Democracy and Governance Office (DGO) and the Health and Education Office (HEO). The Mission also maintains a cross-cutting office with a large role in economic development activities. The EDO is responsible for the management of a large portfolio (approximately $20 million/year). These activities currently include a robust agriculture program, private sector diversification, energy sector reform, and macro-economic reform. The office must closely coordinate with the cross-cutting portfolio as well as regional programs managed from the USAID/Central Asian Republics Mission (USAID/CAR), which is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC><strong>Amendment 1<br />Clarification on Small Business Size Standard for this Acquisition</strong>
<p>The size standard for this acquisition is $14.0M and not $19.0M or 500 Employees as listed under NAICS 562910. The reason for this is as follows:</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is 562910 "Environmental Remediation Services" and note 14b (attached to the SBA Table of Small Business Size Standards Effective January 7, 2013) requires..."If any activity in the procurement can be identified with a separate NAICS code, or component of a code with a separate distinct size standard, and that industry accounts for 50 percent or more of the value of the entire procurement, then the proper size standard is the one for that particular industry, and not the Environmental Remediation Service size standard."</p>
<p>In the Government's opinion, NAICS code 238910 will likely account for more than 50 percent of the value of the procurement, and therefore, the size standard shall be $14.0M.</p>
<p>The entire Note 14b to NAICS 562910 - Environmental Remediation Services is:</p>
<p>b) For purposes of classifying a Government procurement as Environmental Remediation Services, the general purpose of the procurement must be to restore or directly support the restoration of a contaminated environment. This includes activities such as preliminary assessment, site inspection, testing, remedial investigation, feasibility studies, remedial design, remediation services, containment, and removal of contaminated materials or security and site closeouts. The general purpose of the procurement need not necessarily include remedial actions. Also, the procurement must be composed of activities in three or more separate industries with separate NAICS codes or, in some instances (e.g., engineering), smaller sub-components of NAICS codes with separate and distinct size standards. These activities may include, but are not limited to, separate activities in industries such as: Heavy Construction; Special Trade Contractors; Engineering Services; Architectural Services; Management Consulting Services; Hazardous and Other Waste Collection; Remediation Services; Testing Laboratories; and Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. If any activity in the procurement can be identified with a separate NAICS code, or component of a code with a separate distinct size standard, and that industry accounts for 50 percent or more of the value of the entire procurement, then the proper size standard is the one for that particular industry, and not the Environmental Remediation Service size standard.</p>

The offer must provide within its offer the number of weeks - not to exceed 12 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>Sellers understand that FedBid ranks all Bids by price; however, pursuant to applicable acquisition regulations and/or departmental guidelines, Buyers may use criteria other than price to evaluate offers. Accordingly, please note that, unless otherwise specified in the Buy Terms, below, to the extent required by applicable regulations and/or guidelines, award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Buyer on the basis of price, technical capability, delivery, and past performance. <BR> <BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Offer must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation. Submissions can be sent to clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>BRAND NAME OR EQUAL FAR 52.211-6 Aug. 1999 (a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as "brand name or equal", the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government?s needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation. (b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must: (1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; (2) Clearly identify the item by? (i) Brand name, if any; and (ii) Make or model number; (3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and (4) Clearly describe any modifications the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modifications. (c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an ?equal? product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>Question 1: The spec calls for a 40,000 rpm spindle capable of drilling 25mm, tapping M20 and machining 150cm3.  We believe this to be a specification that does not exist within the market for a machine this size, and therefore we believe there may be a typo.  We interpret high speed to be anything above 12,000 rpm.  Assuming this is the case for the specification and that 40,000 rpm is indeed required, can you ask the end user to re-examine their drilling tapping and machining requirements? Answer 1: The tapping, drilling and maching capacities listed in the technical specifications are those required for the base model.  The vendor will need to specify the changes in capacities for adding the high speed package.  Further, if the inclusion of the high speed package permanently changes the capacities of the base model, this fact would need to be stated. <BR> <BR>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AMENDMENT 4 - Responses to Questions is attached.<br /><br />AMENDMENT 3<br />The BPA covers six distinct technical work areas of possible technical work in the future: <br />&bull; Threshold Program<br />&bull; Economic Analysis<br />&bull; Monitoring and Evaluation<br />&bull; Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)<br />&bull; Social and Gender<br />&bull; Finance, Investment and Trade
<p>Each of these six work areas include a range of possible technical skills that will be required on future call orders, and for some, especially M&amp;E, the range of skills listed is very wide. Given this breadth of listed technical skills described under the BPA, it is possible that many (and possibly most) vendors will not have all the requisite skills across all six work areas or within some or all of the six work areas. This reality should not discourage vendors from responding individually, nor should it be seen as a signal that small vendors need to work together with a large prime contractor to be recognized by MCC.</p>
<p>From MCC's perspective, the objective of the BPA is to generate a population of known vendors with known areas of expertise and interest. While vendors are free to work together to submit a response to the RFQ on all elements of the six work areas, that is not MCC's primary intent. Instead, MCC encourages vendors to respond individually or in small groups to demonstrate their core competencies on any or all of the six work areas and on any or all of the skills required within each work area. It is not MCC's intention to receive responses from a small number of mega-consortia that cover all areas; rather, MCC is seeking to establish relationships with a broad range of possible future partners. That relationship is expected to be flexible. Vendors that demonstrate core competency in a subset of skills within a work area or within a sub-set of work areas will have the opportunity to respond to future task orders either by building new institutional capacity in skills that were not previously listed or to work together with other vendors that have complementary skills. In other words, individual responses from small vendors that cover only a sub-set of skills or work areas will not preclude those vendors from bidding either individually or collectively on task orders that reach beyond the core competencies listed in their response to the BPA.</p>
<p>See Attached Q&amp;As.</p>

<span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The <strong>first cut off date</strong> for vendor submissions of Capability Statements for MCC-13-RFQ-0084 is <strong>extended</strong> for <strong>2 weeks</strong> from May 24, 2013 <strong>to June 7, 2013 at 2:00pm Eastern Daylight Time</strong>.

<p>Vendors need not be capable of performing every requirement under the BPA. Vendors may submit Capability Statements for any of the program needs stated above.</p>
<p>Responses to this Request for Capability Statement shall be submitted to David F. Fuller, at <strong>fullerdf@mcc.gov</strong>. To ensure timely handling, the subject line of ALL email correspondence, SHALL include <strong>"MCC-13-RFQ -0084 (vendor name)".</strong></p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Updating information in SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name of its intention to--<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and <br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through SAM.GOV or by calling 1-866-606-8220 or 334-206-7828 for international calls. <br />(End of Clause)</p>

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>A. Statement of Work</p>
<p>1. Background</p>
<p>Within 42 USC Section 4541 (PL 91-616, Dec. 31, 1970) and 21 USC Section 1101 (Public Law 92-255, March 21, 1972) Congress has specifically recognized the need for appropriate prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs and services for alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and drug abuse among Federal civilian employees. Under 5 USC Sections 7361 and 7362 agencies are encouraged to extend, to the extent feasible, rehabilitation services and programs to family members who are drug abusers and/or alcoholics. 5 USC Section 7901 further allows that, "The head of each agency of the Government of the United States may establish, within the limits of appropriations available, a health service program to promote and maintain the physical and mental fitness of employees under his jurisdiction." To meet these and other applicable statutory requirements, the Department of Commerce (DOC) through its Office of Human Resources Management, has directed the establishment of employee assistance programs (EAPs) within all of its subordinate agencies.</p>
<p>2. General</p>
<p>The Employee Health Unit located in Boulder Colorado has the responsibility to establish and maintain an employee assistance program for the approximate 1100 employees located in this geographic region.<br /><br />3. Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to acquire the services of a qualified organization/institution and/or qualified professional practitioners, hereinafter referred to as the contractor, to provide 1) clinical counseling and other life management assistance to DOC employees, their immediate family members, and anyone living within an<br />employee's household who has an impact on the employee's well-being; 2) employee outreach and education programs; 3) counseling and training for managers and supervisors; and 4) an annual report which document the extent to which the required services were performed. <br /><br />4. Employee Population and Location</p>
<p>There are approximately 1100 employees located in and around the Boulder area who are eligible for EAP service at the Broadway site. Office space will be provided within the Employee Health Service located at 325 Broadway, Boulder Colorado.</p>
<p><br />5. Responsibilities of Key Agency Personnel</p>
<p>Providing effective EAP services will be dependent on a close working relationship between the contractor and key personnel from participating agencies. These key personnel and their responsibilities are as follows.</p>
<p>EAP Administrator</p>
<p>The EAP Administrator will coordinate the implementation and on-going operation of the overall program, provide liaison between the contractor and the participating agencies, and report on the contractor's performance.</p>
<p><br />PERFORMANCE BASED QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN</p>
<p><br />1. PURPOSE</p>
<p>This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and applied document used to ensure that systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of the Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) standards included in this Purchase Order. The intent is to ensure that the Contractor performs in accordance with performance metrics set forth in the contract documents, that the Government receives the quality of services called for in the contract and that the Government only pays for the acceptable level of services received.</p>
<p>2. AUTHORITY</p>
<p>Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under Contract Section E - Inspection and Acceptance, which provides for inspections and acceptance of the articles, services, and documentation called for in Purchase Order to be accomplished by the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative.</p>
<p>3. Statement of Work</p>
<p>The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions necessary to meet the quality standards set forth by the Purchase Order. The QASP is put in place to provide Government surveillance oversight of the Contractor's performance to assure performance is timely, effective and delivering the results specified in the Purchase Order.</p>
<p>4. GOVERNMENT RESOURCES</p>
<p>The following definitions for Government resources are applicable to this plan:<br />Contracting Officer (CO) - [Reference Section G, Clause G.1 1352.201-70 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (April 2010)], A person duly appointed with the authority to enter into, administer, or terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings on behalf of the Government.<br />Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) - [Reference Section G, Clause G.2 1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (COR) April 2010)] An individual designated in writing by the Contracting Officer to act as his authorized representative to assist in administering a contract. The source and authority for a Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COR) is the Contracting Officer. COR limitations are contained in the written letter of designation.</p>
<p>5. RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Government resources shall have responsibilities for the implementation of this QASP as follows:<br />Contracting Officer - The Contracting Officer [as defined in Section G, Clause G.1 1 1352.201-70 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (April 2010)] ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract and safeguards the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship. It is the Contracting Officer that assures the Contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under the contract. The Contracting Officer is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor's performance. COR - The COR [as defined in Section G, Clause G.2 1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (COR) April 2010)] is responsible for technical administration of the project and assures proper Government surveillance of the Contractor's performance.</p>
<p>Any changes that the Contractor deems may affect contract, price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action. While the COR may serve as a direct conduit to provide Government guidance and feedback to the Contractor on technical matters, he or she is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the Contractor deems may affect contract, price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action.</p>
<p>6. METHODS OF QA SURVEILLANCE</p>
<p>The below listed methods of surveillance shall be used in the administration of this QASP. In addition to specific instructions that may be mentioned, the appropriate and standardized form that is to be used for documentation of QA surveillance is the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form.<br />100% Inspection - This level of inspection shall be accomplished by monitoring and documentation. <br />Periodic Inspection - Periodic inspections shall be conducted if and when specified in the Purchase Order. <br />Random Monitoring - Random monitoring shall be conducted at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Even though the Government, through its COR, will be monitoring the contractor's performance on a continuing basis, the volume of tasks performed by the contractor makes technical inspections of every task and step impractical. Accordingly, the Government will use a quality-assurance review process to monitor the contractor's performance under this contract. The contractor's performance will be evaluated at the end of the Purchase Order period of performance, contract period or if there is an unsatisfactory report submitted by the COR for any performance problem on the contract. Ratings will be made in two categories.</p>
<p>Satisfactory: Level of performance that in the aggregate meets the Performance Standard; Deficiencies are minor and offset by outstanding elements of performance within the Standard;</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory: Level of performance that in the aggregate fails to meet the Performance Standard; Deficiencies are pervasive;</p>
<p>In general, the work will be evaluated in terms of how well the requirements of the purchase order are satisfied, the extent to which the work performed follows the approach found in the Statement of Work, quality of work, clarity of documentation, timely completion of scheduled tasks, cost control and business relations. At the discretion of the COR or the Contracting Officer or Specialist, other government officials approved by the Contracting Officer or Purchasing Agent may be asked to evaluate a particular deliverable or set of deliverables.</p>
<p><br />7. ANALYSIS OF SURVEILLANCE RESULTS</p>
<p>When appropriate, the CO may investigate an event further to determine if all the facts and circumstances surrounding the event were considered in the COR opinions outlined on the forms. The CO will immediately discuss every element receiving a substandard rating with the Contractor to assure that corrective action is promptly initiated.</p>
<p>At the end of every contract period, the COR will prepare a written report for the CO summarizing the overall results of his/her surveillance of the Contractor's performance during the previous period. This report will become part of the formal QA documentation. This documentation will be used for the contractor's yearly performance report documenting quality, timeliness of performance, cost control, business relations and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>If the level of performance is deemed to be unsatisfactory, the remedies at 52.246-4(e) will be assessed against the Contractor.</p>
<p><br />Deliverables:</p>
<p>The COR will, in addition to providing documentation to the Contracting Officer, maintain a complete Quality Assurance file. The file will contain copies of all reports, evaluations, recommendations, and any actions related to the Government's performance of the quality assurance function, including the originals of all Quality Assurance Monitoring Forms. All such records will be retained for the life of this contract. The COR shall forward these records to the Contracting Officer at termination or completion of the contract.</p>

<p>The USAID Kyrgyz Republic Mission (USAID/KR) is headquartered in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic, a sub-office in Osh, Kyrgyz Republic. The Kyrgyz Republic is bordered by Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. The Kyrgyz Republic is an emerging parliamentary democracy still recovering from a violent political transition in 2010. Because it serves as a potential model for democracy in the region, and because of its proximity to South Asia and its potential to contribute to stability in nearby Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Kyrgyz Republic is of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government's program of assistance in the Kyrgyz Republic is focused on the growth of diversified enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare and education services. The mission manages over $50 million in assistance funds annually. The Mission implements its programs together with more than 30 contractor and grantee teams.</p>
<p>The Mission currently has three technical offices: the Economic Development Office (EDO), the Democracy and Governance Office (DGO) and the Health and Education Office (HEO). The Mission also maintains a cross-cutting office with a large role in economic development activities. The EDO is responsible for the management of a large portfolio (approximately $20 million/year). These activities currently include a robust agriculture program, private sector diversification, energy sector reform, and macro-economic reform. The office must closely coordinate with the cross-cutting portfolio as well as regional programs managed from the USAID/Central Asian Republics Mission (USAID/CAR), which is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

The key objective of the orchestration activity is to use the best data available to balance between enterprise and individual goals and objectives based upon a wide variety of stakeholder requirements and desires which cannot all be realized in an end state product due to resource limitations, technical limitations, risk, and organizational capacity to execute.  <br>  1.	Develop and maintain the Common Operating Environment (COE) Implementation plans such that the plan provides current, correct, clear and executable guidance for all COE stakeholders.    Issue draft updates for review and comment, adjudicate comments, and develop COE proposals for presentation at the Technical Advisory Board (TAB) in order to support the change process for publishing an updated version of the plan.  It is anticipated that annual updates to the COE Implementation Plan will be required.  <br>  2.	Perform analysis of capability alignment across Computing Environments (CE's) to include programmatic,  schedule, and technical alignment (technology and interfaces) to allow risk assessment and status reporting of all activities related to development, integration, test, and certification of capabilities specified via all authoritative business process.  Indentify gaps, disconnects, misalignments and recommend corrective action.  <br>  3.	Develop and submit Common Operating Environment Proposals (COEPs) for additions or modifications to the cross cutting capability list.  <br>  a.	Conduct cross CE analyses to identify additional capability gaps and to substantiate the existing set of capability gaps. Develop COEP for gaps identified for TAB considerations.      <br>  b.

Ensure and encourage coordination and technical collaboration across CEs.  <br>  b.	Prepare monthly slides to highlight CEWG and SOSE&I COE activities and metrics report.   <br>  5.	Support process improvement activities designed to assess the current Army and DoD Acquisition Business rules in order to identify opportunities, reduce time to fielding and enable costing of COE by CE leaders and Program Executive Offices (PEOs).  Develop and pilot alternatives to current practices which can reasonably be thought to support the Army mission, and comply with applicable laws, policy and regulation (or proposes needed changes to regulation and policy) with sufficient justification of the need for the change as expressed in terms of benefits to war fighter or the generating force.  Draft changes to Information Assurance (IA) policy/process/security; investigate assumptions that can be made in testing and IA process due to Software Development Kits (SDKs) and ecosystem development, and coordinate with CIO G6.  <br>  6.

Prepare and review documentation and taskers in support of the COE POM process.  <br>  Task 2:  Verification and Validation:  Verification and Validation (V&V) are well understood systems engineering activities aimed at meeting user requirements in and end-state design/product.  These activities are performed in order to reduce the risk that a design fails to meet functional, performance, quality, cost, schedule and other requirements imposed upon the designer/developer.  Properly planned and executed, V&V can have a positive return on investment for a development activity due to the potential to avoid cost and schedule growth associated with non-conformant design and development and low product quality.  <br>  1.	Review technical documents, architectures, plans, specifications, etc. to assess the suitability and conformance such documents to higher level sources of technical data, requirements, design, etc.  Analysis should include, but not be limited to, requirements traceability and allocation, standards compliance, completeness, correctness, testability, etc.  Document deficiencies and develop reports which addresses specific instances of technical non-conformance as well as root cause analysis and suggested process improvements to lower rates of non-conformance in a systematic manner.  <br>  2.

<DESC>Below is a listing of the questions submitted regarding special notice W31P4Q134DMDI and the Government's formal response to all submitted questions. All other guidelines and information listed within special notice W31P4Q134DMDI remain the same; including the 5:00 PM Central Standard Time, June, 06, 2013 submission deadline for formal RFI responses.  <br>  <br> The RFI is not asking for proprietary information, only input on the technology areas, issues and opportunities DMDI should have as a focus for the near future. <br>  <br> 1.	My company licenses software products that meet some of the needs identified in this RFI.  Can Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software products be suggested as a solution to some of the issues mentioned?  <br>  <br> Government's Response: Yes.  The focus of the RFI is on the technology areas associated with Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation and the potential products that may develop from the solutions to issues in those technology areas.  From the RFI,  quote mark Responses to this RFI should clearly link a technology area with a specific concept of how that technology can impact that marketplace. quote mark   The RFI does not exclude COTS as a potential solution. <br>  <br> 2.	If COTS software may be used, how does the Army envision that licenses to the software would be distributed/maintained?  Would the Army hold licenses?  Would individual institute contributors be required to procure licenses?  <br>  <br> Government's Response: The focus of the RFI is on the technology areas associated with Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation and the issues and opportunities associated with those technologies.  Should a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) be issued requesting proposals for the creation of the Institute it would be up to the proposer to either select or establish a mechanism to select  software, establish the procedures for licensing of software, and manage the administration of those licenses.  The Department of Army is leading this effort for the Federal Government to stand up the institute, and will participate as one of the Institute partners. <br>  <br> 3.	Is the intent of the Institute to develop new software source code?  <br>  <br> Government's Response: The focus of the RFI is on the technology areas associated with Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation and the issues associated with those technologies.  The General Intent of the institute is described in the RFI.   It is up to respondents to determine the activities of the Institute, which may include developing new source code or enhancing existing software source code.  The government is seeking input on the technology areas, issues in this domain and the potential products that might result in solutions to those issues whether it is hardware or software. <br>  <br> 4.	If multiple COTS software products are suggested as ideas, how will the institute determine which products to use?  How will interoperability be handled?   <br>  <br> Government's Response: The focus of the RFI is on the technology areas associated with Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation and the issues and opportunities associated with those technologies. It is up to respondents to determine the activities of the Institute including how the issues of interoperability and COTS products would be handled.   <br>  <br>  <br> 5.	Is the USG looking for assistance from commercial software companies at this time? <br>  <br> Government's Response: The focus of the RFI is on the technology areas associated with Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation and the issues and opportunities associated with those technologies.  The government is seeking input on the technology areas, issues in this domain, and the potential products that might result in solutions to those issues.  Reference the responses provided above for questions 1, 2, and 4 for additional information.  Responses to the RFI from industry, including commercial software companies, are welcome. <br>  <br> 6.	Is the USG looking for manufacturers to respond at this time, or commercial software companies? <br>  <br> Government's Response: The focus of the RFI is on the technology areas associated with Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation and the issues and opportunities associated with those technologies. The government is seeking input on the technology areas, issues in this domain and the potential products that might result in solutions to those issues from industry (which includes manufacturers and commercial software companies). <br>  <br> 7.	How will competition be handled within the Institute?  Many companies who may want to participate may be competitors of one another. <br>  <br> Government's Response: The focus of the RFI is on the technology areas associated with Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation and the issues and opportunities associated with those technologies. It will be up to respondents to determine the governance model and membership requirements of the Institute. The governance model would include discussion on intellectual property (IP) protection.  <br>  <br> 7.	Will there be a cost sharing requirement to become a member of the institute?  <br>  <br> Government's Response: Cost sharing will be a requirement in the event an acquisition occurs. <br> Requirements for cost sharing are expected to be addressed in any eventual BAA.  <br>  <br> 9.	How will intellectual property be protected?  If something is developed within the institute, who has the copyright and patent rights?  <br>  <br> Government's Response: The focus of the RFI is on the technology areas associated with Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation and the issues and opportunities associated with those technologies. It would be up to respondents to establish the policy (approach) for intellectual property, data rights and any copyright or patent rights. <br>  <br> 10.       The regional aspect that is highlighted in the NNMI Preliminary Design Document was not emphasized in the DMDI Institute RFI. Is the regional aspect still important for the DMDI Institute, and the other two newly announced Institutes? <br>  <br> Government's Response: The focus of this RFI is on the technology areas associated with Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation and the issues and opportunities associated with those technologies.  It is not the purpose of this RFI to seek responses that address aspects of any potential future institutes. <br>  <br> 11.The  quote mark DMDI Overview quote mark  document from manufacturing.gov specifically mentions  quote mark electro-mechanical assemblies and systems quote mark  as the target for the DMDI institute. The DMDI RFI does not specifically narrow the scope to the electro-mechanical realm (except one mention under  quote mark Advanced Analysis, (e) iii quote mark ). Is it intended that the scope of the institute be electro-mechanical, or should/can we consider other product realms/areas? <br>  <br> Government's Response: This RFI is looking for input on the technology tenets of Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise, Intelligent Machines, Advanced Analysis and Cyber Physical Security.  To narrow the scope of an eventual DMDI institute in order to achieve the necessary focus, electro-mechanical assemblies could be considered one reasonable target.  But, this RFI is asking for input on technology tenets, not the focus of an eventual institute. <br>   <br> 12. Is this intended to be macro-scale manufacturing, or is the USG interested in approaches to micro- and nonmanufacturing as well? <br>  <br> Government's Response: This RFI is looking specifically at the technology tenets of Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise, Intelligent Machines, Advanced Analysis and Cyber Physical Security.  (It is assumed that the question is actually asking about  quote mark nano quote mark  manufacturing and not  quote mark non quote mark  manufacturing).  The digital representation of micro and nano-scale manufacturing processes and products could be a part of the focus of an institute on digital manufacturing and design that will likely require a combination of technology push/development, policy/strategy to promote the practice, training...etc, effecting a paradigm shift in practices impacting our global industrial competiveness as well as our DoD industrial infrastructure. <br>  <br> 13.      How will the response be used? Will it be used as a preliminary proposal such that it will be reviewed and evaluated? Will the eligibility of submitting a full proposal depend on the evaluation result of the response?  <br>  <br> Government's Response: The RFI responses will be reviewed but not evaluated as proposals are.  There is no eligibility determination that will result from the RFI process. Any resultant BAA will establish the evaluation criteria by which a proposal will be considered for award.  Accordingly, responses to the RFI will not be used as preliminary proposals and those responses will not form basis for eligibility to submit a proposal to any eventual competitive action.   <br>  <br> 14.     Will the response be kept confidential or will be posted on the web? <br>  <br> Government's Response: Reference is made to section 2(iii) of special notice W31P4Q134DMDI,  quote mark The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements.  If the Government develops a program that addresses any submitted or similar topic, the resulting procurement will address technology and business specific requirements as defined by the Government to achieve the required objectives. Any projects developed from the RFI responses may be the subject of a subsequent acquisition; any such subsequent acquisition will be publicized accordingly. quote mark   RFI submissions will not be made publically available.  Responses to the RFI will be kept confidential by the government. <br>  <br> 15.   Other than entity name, address, contact info, will the cost share information need to be included in the response? <br>  <br> Government's Response: This RFI is looking specifically at the technology tenets of Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise, Intelligent Machines, Advanced Analysis and Cyber Physical Security.  Cost share related information does not need to be included in responses, although it would be of interest. Responses should only consist of the information specified in section 3, entity name and address, and point of contact name, phone number and email address. <br>  <br> 16.       Will the RFI responses be made publically available? <br>  <br> Government's Response: RFI submissions will not be made publically available. Reference the responses provided above for questions 13 and 14 for additional information. <br>  <br>

These sources are located on NFSR's 7375100 and 1900520.

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a scientific CMOS camera, which will be integrated into a custom fluorescence microscope used to image and track the motion of nanoscale particles in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) user facility. Nanoparticle imaging and tracking microscopes and methods will be developed in the CNST NanoLab as a resource accessible to researchers in the CNST and to outside users via collaboration. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a scientific CMOS camera that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p><br />The CNST NanoLab has initiated a research project to image and track the motion of nanoparticles by the development of a customized fluorescence microscope system. This microscope system will integrate nanoparticle imaging and tracking by feedback control of a scanning stage. The overall performance of this imaging and tracking fluorescence microscope system - and the success of the research project - will depend critically on the performance of a state-of-the-art scientific CMOS camera, which will be used as the primary sensor to acquire images of fluorescent nanoparticles with high sensitivity, high recording speed, low background noise, and high mechanical stability.</p>
<p>1. SCIENTIFIC CMOS CAMERA. A state-of-the-art scientific CMOS camera is required to image and track fluorescent nanoparticles with high sensitivity, high recording speed, low background noise, and high mechanical stability. The required performance specifications for this camera are as follows:</p>
<p>a. The camera shall have an array of &gt;/= 2048 pixels &times; 2048 pixels with a pixel size of &lt;/= 6.5 micrometers &times; 6.5 micrometers to enable wide-field imaging and super-resolution image analysis with a pixel size of &lt;/= 65 nm when the camera is used with a microscope objective lens of 100&times;magnification.<br /><br />b. The camera shall have a quantum efficiency of &gt;/= 70 percent at 600 nm and &gt;/= 50 percent at a wavelength of 750 nm to enable the sensitive detection of faint fluorescent signals from single nanoparticles.<br /><br />c. The camera shall have a readout speed capability of &gt;/= 100 frames per second at full resolution to enable high-speed recording of the motion of rapidly moving fluorescent nanoparticles.<br /><br />d. The camera shall include any computer cables and connectors required to achieve the full readout speed capability of &gt;/= 100 frames per second at full resolution.<br /><br />e. The camera shall have a typical root mean square readout noise of &lt;/= 2.0 electrons per second at the full readout speed so as to not interfere with the sensitive detection of faint fluorescent signals by the contribution of undue camera background noise.<br /><br />f. The camera shall include&nbsp;both internal air cooling and external water cooling capabilities to eliminate the mechanical vibration of an internal air cooling fan and improve the mechanical stability of the camera for super-resolution imaging.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture Scientific CMOS Cameras are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided.</p>
<p>2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).</p>
<p>3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.</p>
<p>4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to paula.wilkison@nist.gov is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<a href="mailto:scott.comeau.civ@mail.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The goal of the field sterilizer program is to test and evaluate a readily available modernized steam sterilizer with improved sterilization effectiveness that meets the needs of field hospitals.  The sterilizer will be an electrically operated, large chamber steam sterilizer for use in (1) the Central Materiel Section of Combat Support Hospitals (CSHs) to sterilize supplies (e.g., surgical instruments, dressings) used in surgical procedures and other casualty care in the operating room, emergency treatment area, and intensive care units, and (2) the Area Medical Laboratory (AML) to sterilize pathological specimens prior to disposal. Modernization features will include a vacuum cycle and electronic controls for automatic sequencing of sterilizer controls and recording of process conditions.  The Steam Sterilizer, Field Portable (SSFP) is to be used by field medical treatment facilities and therefore must be rugged enough to withstand the rigors of deployment and a variety of austere locations and environments in addition to meeting performance characteristics required in fixed facilities.  The sterilizer must be cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enable use in hospitals.  This will require Boiler and Pressure Vessel certification of the sterilizer design and manufacturing facility by the American Society for Mechanical Engineers (ASME).  All communications shall be submitted to the Contracting Office at scott.comeau@us.army.mil by Close of Business on 13 June 2013.

<DESC>United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) recently concluded the Phase I Embedded Engine Program with the validation of inlet design tools with and without flow control; the design of a set of inlets in the presence of Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI), including multiple flow control approaches; and a first pass at demonstration of loosely-coupled inlet/fan calculations.  This work shall enable Phase II of the program, in which UTRC shall focus on the aerodynamic design of an inlet and distortion-tolerant fan stage for a high-performance embedded engine configuration.  The configuration shall be derived from an audit of existing vehicle-level systems studies to identify regions of design space that provide the highest aircraft-level performance benefits for Blended Wing Body (BWB) propulsion systems.  UTRC shall then engage in mechanical design and fabrication of an inlet and fan test hardware, and validation testing of the new concept in an appropriate high-Reynolds-number NASA wind tunnel.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> PRIORITY 3 ACQUISITION  <br> MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD <br> FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br> BELOW THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD <br>  <br> 1. Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, San Antonio Military  Medical Center (SAMMC) (aka: BAMC), Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 <br>  <br> 2. Description of Action: Priority 03 urgent procurement for Total Reverse Shoulder replacement implants system needed for a non-routine surgery.

Description of Products/Services: This requirement is for Total Reverse Shoulder implants needed for surgery at San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC), Ft Sam Houston, TX implants for an orthopedic surgery. <br>  <br> 4. Authority Cited: Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), Soliciting competition.  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency). <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 5.202(a)(2), Exceptions. The unusual and compelling requirement will not be advertised. <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106(c)(1), Soliciting competition.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR
OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, VA Caribbean Healthcare Systems, 10 Calle Casia, San Juan Puerto Rico.

2.	The VA has the requirement to provide third party asbestos monitoring and inspection services in VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS), San Juan, PR, at the Breezeway/Loading dock upgrade Project.

3.	Environmental Health & Services, Inc. (EH&S) will perform the necessary monitoring, inspection, testing and other support services to ensure that VA patients, employees, and visitors will not be adversely affected by the abatement work, and that the abatement work proceeds in accordance with asbestos abatement VA specifications, as per the contract.

4.	This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.	Only one responsible source can meet mission needs (FAR 6.302-1). The on-site analysis of PCM air samples collected outside the regulated area is required during asbestos abatement projects in order to ensure that the project area, VA patients, employees, and visitors will not be adversely affected by the abatement work. On-site/field analysis of PCM air samples can only be conducted by Asbestos Analyst Registry (ARR) board approved analysts that belong to an ARR approved organization. EH&SS is the only ARR approved organization in Puerto Rico with ARR board approved analysts.

6.	The VA issued a Notice of Intent to sole-source this procurement on Fed Biz Ops (FBO).  EH&S is the only ARR approved organization in Puerto Rico with ARR board approved analysts.

7.	The Contracting Officer performed price analysis on EH&S's proposal and compared the price with that of the Government Estimate.  The Government Estimate was developed using current industry standards.  Negotiations took place which resulted in a determination of price as being fair and reasonable for this project.

8.	As described in No. 6 above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.

9.	The procurement of providing third party asbestos monitoring and inspection services is needed to meet the growing and expanding needs of the medical center, as the veteran population on the island of Puerto Rico has experienced significant growth.

10.	In response to the FBO notice posted, the following companies that have expressed an interested in this project:

Marvin Heymann & Associates

11.	Although these services are only performed by EH&SS, market research will continue to ensure other companies are considered in the future if available.

12.	I certify that the requirement outlined in this Justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC><strong>*THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL*</strong> <br />The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Armament Directorate, Advanced Program Division, System Interface and Integration Branch (EBSN), Eglin AFB, FL&nbsp;awarded a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract on 22 May 2013 in the amount of $73,585.00 to Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions Schweiz (RWMS) AG, Birchstrasse 155; Zurich, Switzerland 79395. The total contract period of performance is 5 months from the time of award.<br />The Government will procure up to 250 rounds of Rheinmetall 25mm PGU 48/B (Formerly the 25mm x 137mm Frangible Armor Piercing (FAP) ammunition). RWMS PGU 48/B round was qualified in the GAU-22/A gun system upon completion of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) in September 2012. The FCT qualification effort determined this ammunition to be safe for use in the GAU-22/A and effective against F-35 target requirements. The 250 rounds will be produced from materials readily available at RWMS' production facility in Switzerland. Since the materials are already in place, RWMS is able to manufacture and deliver them quickly enough to give the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) a head start on Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E). As part of the F-35's LFT&amp;E and Developmental and Operational Test (DT/OT), this FAP ammunition's performance will be evaluated with respect to the GAU-22/A gun system and F-35 aircraft interface requirements.&nbsp;<br />The authority for this action is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). <br />The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting points of contact identified below. The Ombudsman is Colonel Deborah Cafarelli, AFLCMC Eglin, at 102 West D Avenue, Building 11, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495. Her phone number is 850-883-3701. Collect calls will not be accepted.<br />For subcontracting opportunities, please contact Oskar Brodmann, 41443163741 or Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions Schweiz AG, Birchstrasse 155; Zurich, Switzerland 79395.<br /><strong>*THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL*</strong>
