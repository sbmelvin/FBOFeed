<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The government is seeking sources to perform and requesting input from industry to refine and possibly add to the statement of objectives. For example: Statement of Objective should include a quality Control plan addressing the following factors. The following objective should be left out and the following substituted. The Government is intending to issue a request for proposal from the exchange of information and cautions industry not to provide propriety information or to provide restrictive information.

Statement of Work
1.	Scope.  All program aspects should be planned and executed to build the capacity of the Ministry Of Health and its subordinate medical organization’s to both leverage global healthcare organizations capabilities and establish lasting partnerships to improve the overall care offered to the Iraqi people

Statement of Objective

1.1 Program Constraints.  There are certain healthcare partnership activities ongoing in Northern Iraq through an expiring contract overseen by Meridian International. The proposal should include detailed plans to incorporate those activities, deemed worth continuing by the Ministry of Health, into the national Partners in HealthCare for Iraq program.

a.	Organize and/or establish, in coordination with the Ministry of Health, Iraqi professional associations or societies in medical, specialty, nursing, and dental fields.  Once organized, contractor will establish a network of partnerships between the Iraqi organizations and their counterparts operating in the US.  Key elements of the partnership program will include organizational handbooks, established communication network linking both US and Iraqi organizations, operating procedures to be employed by the MOH to maintain these partnerships, and educational materials to increase the proficiency and capability of the Iraqi organizations. 

b.	Identify, in coordination with the Ministry Of Health, the key institutions of higher medical learning and field leaders in the country and establish an organization that can serve as the country’s focal point for long-term improvements in higher education in healthcare related disciplines.  Key elements of the partnership program will include an established communication network linking both US and Iraqi medical institutions, a forum for professional information exchange, develop mentorship program to improve key areas of Ministry Of Health concern once identified, assist in development of medical library, identify and support Iraqi use of existing tele-education programs, and support the acquisition of educational materials as required.

c.	Develop, in coordination with Ministry Of Health, Iraqi teams of medical professionals from pediatric oncology and rehabilitation medicine/amputee care and then establish a program that partners these teams with U.S. advanced specialty care centers.  Critical to the program will be the establishment of the partnerships and communication network between organizations to facilitate the flow of professional information, targeted clinical improvements, advancements through personnel exchanges, and professional and educational information exchanges.  The program model will be documented to enable Ministry Of Health to execute the model across other specialty care disciplines.  

d.	Establish, in coordination with the Ministry Of Health, a healthcare management team that is organized and equipped to develop the strategic plans and programs to enable long-term improvements in the Iraqi healthcare disciplines.  Develop the partnership of this team with US organizations with expertise in healthcare management, resource management, and human resource development with the selected Iraqi counterparts in the Ministry of Health, Governorates, and hospital administration. 

e.	The contractor shall develop an information management mechanism, including a website, to facilitate, track and report program activities and achievements.

1.2 Additional Information: 

a.  Contractors may add to the statement of objectives based on their analysis of the above objectives and constraint to provide a comprehensive program design. This shall be addressed as an optional item in the proposal.

b.  Contractors shall have previous history of performance in developing and executing a program of this type, scope, and under the conditions that currently exist in Iraq.

c.	Contractor may employ US Government personal security detachments based on availability.  If not available at time and place of contract execution, contractor will be responsible for providing privately contracted personal security detachment.



Please provide input and sources to paul.duvall@cpa-iq.org and Naomi.olin@cpa-iq.org not later than September 29, 2004. Intended date of release of the Request for Proposal will be soon after that date.

<DESC>Statement of Objectives

A.	Partnership in Healthcare Program (PIHC).  

	Iraq’s healthcare system has suffered from decades of neglect and isolation.  A vital partnership between U.S. and Iraqi professional medical and allied health services societies, institutes of higher medical education, and other medical voluntary organizations will help advance the modernization of Iraq’s healthcare system while building valuable bridges and bonds between these societies.
    
PIHC Statement of Work

B.1.0  Scope.  The PIHC is to be a cooperative effort between the Ministry of Health and the US Mission, Senior Health Attaché, in Iraq.   Program implementation will be managed by a qualified contractor with relevant experience and expertise. A joint PIHC Steering Committee will serve as the technical leadership for this program.  The committee will be comprised of Department of State Health Advisors, PCO Health Sector Program Manager and Iraqi Ministry of Health personnel.  It will be chaired by the Director General for Primary Care and Public Health and the Director General for Medical Operations and Specialized Services.  The committee will conduct quarterly program reviews to ensure select program features are meeting the target areas of improvement to the Iraqi Healthcare System.   

PIHC Statement of Objective

B.1.1 Program Enhancement.  There are certain healthcare partnership activities ongoing in Northern Iraq through an expiring contract overseen by Meridian International. The proposal should include detailed plans to incorporate those activities, deemed worth continuing by the Ministry of Health, into the national Partners in HealthCare for Iraq program.
