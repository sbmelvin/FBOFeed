The government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Commercial Items (Jan 1999) which is incorporated into this Request for Proposal below. The Government anticipates the award of three or less contracts from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) Technical capability (ii) Price. Technical capability is approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) TECHNICAL, PAST PERFORMANCE' and PRICE with past performance being significantly more important than Price when being evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order for each location based on the factors above. The offeror shall submit at a minimum a completed "Offer scheduled"(attachment 3) and the "Contractor Information" (attachment 4)</p>
<p>Technical acceptability will be determined by the following:</p>
<p>1. Instructor qualification. Minimum a Black Belt in one discipline or 10 years training experience in non-belt awarding disciplines i.e. wrestling, boxing, MMA, or combat fighting systems.</p>
<p>2. Experience. Provide evidence of a minimum of 4 years of Special Operations Forces military training experience.</p>
<p>3. Certifications. Provide certificate in each of the disciplines or proof of experience.</p>
<p>4. For the Hurlburt Field FL location. On-site inspection of the contractor facility</p>
<p>All proposals that are deemed technically acceptable for the above criteria will then be required to provide an instructor demonstration. Each vender will be given 1 hour to provide the demonstration and shall be graded on the following areas:</p>
<p>Demonstration grading criteria SOW paragraph 1.5:</p>
<p>1. All techniques must be taught with and without body armor - GO/NO GO<br />2. Gaining and maintaining dominate body position standing and on the ground - GO/NO GO <br />3. Basic submission techniques - choke and joint manipulation - GO/NO GO <br />4. Edged weapon offense/defense and disarmament - GO/NO GO<br />5. Weapon retention and disarmament (carbine/pistol) - GO/NO GO</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation. Using questionnaires (attachment 5), the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information for only offers rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>Offerors shall identify all ( DoD and FAA) past or current contracts during the last 3 years for efforts similar to the Government requirement as stated in this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the offerors previous performance in the following areas:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offerors ability to successfully perform the requirements of the Performance Work Statement based on demonstrated past and present experience under recent and relevant contracts. Recency is defined as projects performed in the last three (3) years. Relevancy is defined as contracts involving:</p>
<p>Similar type training with Department of Defense, Federal, State or local law enforcement. The class size should be at least 15 students.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating as defined in MP5315.3, Table 3:</p>
<p>Substantial Confidence: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p>Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p>Limited Confidence: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p>No Confidence: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p>Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable or the offerors performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating and is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>In the event that the government does not make an award pursuant to paragraph above, the government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance assessment rating of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications (Aug 2013) - Commercial Items and DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (June 2005) apply to this Request for Proposal and the offeror must include a completed copy of these provisions with their proposal or indicate (with DUNS Number) that current information is available on the federal government website ORCA (htpps://www.sam.gov) The full text of these clauses and provisions may be accessed electronically at the website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil.
