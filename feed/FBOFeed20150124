<DESC>The Pacific Regional Contracting Office (PRCO) at Tripler AMC, Hawaii intends to award a firm-fixed price, personal service bridge contract for adult/child psychiatrist services.  This requirement is for a period of performance from 01 March 2015 through 31 August 2015 (six-month base only).  <br>  <br> The proposed acquisition is intended as a sole-source set-aside to Dr. Harriet Loo to ensure continued services are maintained for Brian Allgood Army Community Hospital, MEDDAC-Korea due to the potential of a prolonged credentialing process if the incumbent is not retained.  It is not possible to find a vendor that has the capability to fulfill this requirement with a start date of 1 March 2015.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Although this requirement will be sole-sourced, the follow-on (base and four option periods) contract is anticipated to be solicited via full and open competition at a later date.  <br>  <br> The Contracting Officer is Mrs. Kanoe Sing-Ching, (808) 433-7003, kanoelani.c.singching.civ@mail.mil and the Contracting Specialist is Mr. Lee Miyashiro, (808) 433-6450, lee.h.miyashiro.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The Government intends to award a cooperative agreement as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305.  This competition is not governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), but rather by the DoD Directive 3210.06, dated 6 February 2014. The purpose of the U.S. Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) cooperative agreement (COA) announcement is to solicit proposals for a single-award to a recipient, who will carry out the K-College STEM education and outreach programs on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of the Army to help address the nation's need of a diverse, agile and highly competent science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) literate talent pool. Through the AEOP COA award, the Army envisions the government to work with a recipient with an established consortium of organizations to collaboratively advance Army-sponsored STEM education and outreach programs, conducted across the United States, Puerto Rico as well as DoD locations in Europe and the Pacific.
