Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. All proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.<br />It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. <br />Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br />Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other<br />restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Request for Written Quotation will be issued. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.</p>

Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the supply and delivery of two aircraft rescue and fire fighting vehicles for Kabul International Airport (KAIA) in Afghanistan. 

JFC Brunssum is serving as the contracting agency for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. JFC Brunssum intends to use the bidding procedure involving a sealed bid with two envelopes (technical and price proposal). The Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract will be awarded to the lowest compliant bid. Partial bidding is not authorized.

The estimated value of this project is Euro 1.5 million. The reference for this project is IFIB-ACO-BRU-09-53. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

The Invitation for International Bid (IFIB) package will contain material at the level of NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The Department of Commerce does not serve as the contracting agency for NATO ICB projects. Its role is to approve for participation in NATO ICB those facilities that are located within the United States. Only facilities that have first been approved for participation in NATO ICB may be nominated to the bidders list for a NATO ICB project. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Deadline for requesting Declaration of Eligibility: 04 June 2009

(Under MBC rules, the contracting agency will continue to accept nominations to the bidders list after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.)

3. Expected bid closing date: 22 July 2009

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which the Defense Distribution Center, New Cumberland, PA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for Optical Memory Laser Cards.  The cards are used as part of an Automated Manifest System.  These cards have the capability to hold 1200 pages of information, and can withstand the harshest military conditions without any loss of data.

General Dynamics Information Technology Inc. is the only source that can provide these cards due to the proprietary nature of the Automated Manifest System.  Any attempt to develop an alternate source to provide this system, if possible, would result in a substantial cost to the Government.  Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order (FFP) utilizing FAR Part 13 to General Dynamics Information Technology Inc. for the Optical Memory Laser Cards.

Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The delivery date will be 30 days after receipt of the order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 326130 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. 

All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to provide the Optical Memory Laser Cards by 4:00 PM EDT, FRIDAY, MAY 29, 2009 to Daniel Herring, Acquisition Operations, DDC J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone:  717-770-6030, FAX:  717-770-5689, or e-mail:  daniel.herring@dla.mil for consideration by the agency.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the modification of three (3) Soneticom CRU-5000 Lynx 3 wide band processors as part of the Interference Monitoring and Detection Systems (IMDS) test bed at the William J Hughes Technical Center.  The FAA National Airspace System (NAS) is progressing to digital equipment, and the current Angle Of Arrival (AOA) technology is not adequate to locate digital RFI signals.  To resolve this, the FAA would like to modify the existing equipment (CRU-5000 Lynx 3 wide band processors) by adding the capability to process Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) technology.
The period of performance for the contract will be July 1, 2009 through August 31, 2010.  
Only Soneticom, Inc. equipment will be considered for this requirement.  The FAA is conducting this survey to determine potential sources available to provide this equipment.  
Potential sources must provide documentation to the FAA showing that your company is an authorized provider.  Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.   The NAICS code for this requirement is 334515 Instrument Manufacturing for Measuring and Testing Electricity and Electrical Signals, and 334419 Other Electronic Component Manufacturing, both with a small business size standard of 500 employees.
This market survey shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these items.  The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the Market Survey, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement.
The interested vendor's response must be submitted no later than 2:00 P.M. local time on May 29, 2009.

<a href="mailto:surrusjk@id.doe.gov">Surrusco, Janet K</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID), intends to award a firm-fixed price, sole-source contract for commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 13.106(b)(1) to the small business vendor J. W. Bibler & Associates, 893 Honey Court, Arnold, CA  95223-3429 to provide DOE-ID and HQ personnel training on contract management specifically related to DOE-ID's prime contracts.  The course is called the Contract Management Seminar Series.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is $87,500 for a period from June 2009 to September 2009.  The NAICS is 611430.
From 2004-2005, the DOE-ID underwent a significant change in its management and operations (M&O) contracting strategy and structure to fulfill the need of overseeing the DOE Nuclear Energy's Idaho National Laboratory and the Idaho Completion Project.  This dramatic change necessitated a need to re-train DOE-ID federal employees towards a better understanding of both the revamped contracts and the federal role in administering the new contracts.
Bibler worked with DOE-ID management and staff to: develop a contract management seminar series (CMSS) that would enable participants to understand the contracting environment; become familiar with the newly issued M&O contracts; understand the relationship between contractors and federal oversight personnel; and, become knowledgeable of the functions, duties, and limitations on the authority of oversight personnel at DOE-ID and DOE Headquarters.  In 2007, J.W. Bibler & Associates included the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP) in a refresher course of the CMSS.  J.W. Bilber & Associates has also performed three subsequent assessments to determine the extent to which DOE-ID employees have retained and are using the knowledge skills, and information obtained from the CMSS.
In developing the training and subsequent assessments, J.W. Bibler & Associates obtained significant knowledge of: the DOE-ID; the Idaho National Laboratory and Idaho Completion Project contracts; the DOE Headquarters organization; and the interactions necessary to accomplish the DOE-ID mission.  
Under this award, the contractor will develop and present a refresher course for both DOE-ID and DOE Headquarters focused on the behaviors, skills, and knowledge most important to the success of the major contracting activities taking place on the site, inclusive of the INL, ICP, and the current request for proposal for the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP).  In addition, an abbreviated version of the original CMSS will be conducted for new DOE-ID employees.  It is critical for the developer and instructor of this training seminar series to have intimate knowledge of:  the DOE-ID organization; DOE-ID and DOE Office of Nuclear Energy relationships and authorities; contractual changes in the INL, ICP, and AMWTP contracts; as well as FAR and DEAR changes that may impact these three contracts; and, demonstrated expertise in organizational change and leadership and management disciplines.  
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification prior to the response due date of May 26, 2009.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements listed. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the award to J. W. Bibler & Associates.  Responses are due by May 26, 2009, 3:00 p.m. (MDT).  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to surrusjk@id.doe. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<DESC>In a continuing effort to meet the publics demands and expectations for recreation opportunities and to maximize the value of available funds, a need has been identified for professional business consulting services to assist with the development and implementation of a more business-based approach to Forest Service recreation management.  
The Forest Service anticipates requesting business consulting services on an as needed basis for a variety of tasks.  These tasks may vary from being national in scope to affecting only one Region or National Forest.  For example, at the national level the agency may be interested in exploring options for enhancing partnership capabilities and expanding contributed income funding opportunities.  Services may be requested to help identify strategies and the Agency may seek assistance in pursing implementation support for the strategies. 
At a smaller scale, services may be sought on an as needed basis to assist with reviewing or improving various business processes.  An example might be to review financial analysis used to support capital investment decisions in a Region and provide advice on ways to improve the process.  In some cases, advice and assistance might be sought to assist a particular Forest in evaluating potential leasing or concessionaire opportunities.

The US Forest Service is seeking an organization to provide various strategic professional business advisory and assistance services for recreation management on National Forest System lands at locations throughout the United States and its territories.  Although the term recreation is used throughout this document and will be the primary area of focus for business services, that is not intended to exclude obtaining similar services for those program areas closely integrated with recreation management, such as wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, heritage, interpretation, conservation education, partnerships, and volunteer management.  The business advisory and assistance services may include elements such as:  strategic planning and program management; financial analysis; market analysis; operations efficiency evaluations; partnership analysis; facility management planning; marketing; interpretation strategy; and, organizational change management.  

Proposals are due at 3:00 p.m. MST, October 20, 2008.  The solicitation will be available on approximately September 5, 2008, and can be downloaded from this site at that time.  All responsible vendors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.  The proposed project listed here is a partial small business set-aside.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ)contract to support assessment and refurbishment activities associated with the SAGE IIIinstrument. Work will be defined in task orders and the initial task will be issued to support an assessment of the instrument which will be led by the NASA Langley ResearchCenter.  While there are no commitments of any kind regarding a potential flightopportunity for the SAGE III instrument at this time, if additional work is authorizedand directed by NASA Headquarters, an IDIQ contract will permit the Government to issuetask orders for further assessment of the instrument, for support of missionaccommodation studies, and for instrument refurbishment and updates necessary for aflight mission. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation(BATC). NASA LaRC has previously contracted with BATC for the development of the earlierSAGE II and SAGE III instruments.  Through this work, BATC has developed unique andworld-class expertise in space-based solar/lunar occultation instruments.  As theoriginal SAGE III instrument prime contractor, BATC produced the SAGE III instrumentwhich will be assessed and possibly refurbished under the proposed contract.  BATCtherefore has intimate and unique familiarity with the SAGE III instrument as well as along history producing similar instruments.  BATC also has the unique engineering,manufacturing, and other processes necessary to perform the proposed work. BATC isintimately familiar with the design, assembly, subsystem interaction, overall function,and calibration of the SAGE III instrument since BATC designed, built, and demonstratedthis capability based on previous SAGE III efforts with LaRC.  While the Governmentstrives for complete "as built" documentation, the degree of insight gained throughactual hands on experience cannot be provided by a source other than BATC withoutincurring significant cost and schedule impacts and significant technical risk to theinstrument.  BATC's engineering and instrument development processes are proprietary andare not available as part of the instrument design package. The legacy knowledge andunique facilities which BATC can bring to bear in assessing and refurbishing the SAGE IIIinstrument cannot be duplicated by any other company without extensive time and theresulting additional costs for study and familiarization with the instrument, includingits design and operating characteristics.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:This announcement solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program on Safety of Oil and Gas Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research.  For a summary of TA&R research recently performed, visit http://www.mms.gov/tarsafety/index.htm.
BACKGROUND:   
The MMS TA&R Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement.  Selected white papers will be requested to submit proposals.  Proposals selected for funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2010.  The MMS anticipates that $2,000,000 may be available for the initiation of new research addressing topics identified through this announcement.  NOTICE:  The MMS may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify the MMS if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared.     
OBJECTIVE:  The topics for the FY 2010 safety research funding should be limited to the following topics: 
1.  An Evaluation of the Use of Mean versus Nominal Yield Strength of Steel in Offshore Structural DesignEvaluate the American Institute of Steel Construction Inc.s, (AISC), criteria for nominal steel strength designation.  The study should assess how nominal yield strength is determined and certified; in particular; consider how nominal strength correlates to mean yield strength.  Also, assess how nominal yield strength correlates to other steel properties / characteristics of importance in structural steel analyses.  Is mean yield strength definable for use as a design variable?  If so, develop a procedure by which mean yield strength for use in structural analyses is to be determined.  Keep in mind, the resulting mean yield strength has to be applicable to all common members in the structural analysis.   Assess the reliability of the resulting structural analyses.  Include a parallel assessment of mean yield strength of the weld material. 2.  The Reliability of Metocean Measures - Site Specific MetoceanEvaluate the methodology and resulting quality of site specific metocean measures performed in accordance with the American Petroleum Institute (API) and other applicable standards to determine the reliability of hindcast data (including site-specific data) as an indicator of past and future metocean events.  The study shall assess and quantify the reliability of instrument placement, operation and calibration; non-measured, antidotal, or derived metocean data, and associated mathematical models; data sets selections, manipulations (including pooling points, track shifting, boundary conditions, smoothing of site-specific conditions, bias removal and the like) and impact on resulting measures.  Assess metocean models for consistency with accepted standard metocean practices, in particular, to discern between methodology founded in theory versus methodology which relies on statistics.  Reliability is to be assessed and quantified not only in terms of the certainty of the measure, but also for consistency with accepted standard metocean practices throughout the profession (not solely in the Gulf of Mexico), as well as for consistency with met ocean theory and practice applied elsewhere in API and other industry standards.  3.  Metocean Measures Hind-cast and Prior Exposure in Offshore Structural Design and AssessmentEvaluate methodology developed under American Petroleum Institute (API) standards as they relate to the structural design and assessment of OCS facilities based on prior storm exposure in order to clarify methodology used and address any uncertainties of using this method.4.  Use of Vibration Measurement Systems to Assess Underwater Structural Integrity of OCS Facilities.Evaluate technology, methodology and use of Vibration Measurement (VM) as an alternative to current MMS approved inspection practices used for assessing underwater structural integrity of OCS facilities.  Study should include analysis of VM systems, applications and limitations, risks, and comparison of VM inspection against existing systems to document its effectiveness relative to level II/III inspections.5. Use of Epoxy-based Materials in Well Abandonments MMS is considering use of epoxy-based materials for abandonment for wells damaged by hurricanes. These wells do not have vertical access and may be buckled below the mud line therefore preventing wire line operations via tubing to set plugs near the packer or punch the tubing to circulate cement into the casing.  This study should evaluate materials and procedures for epoxy-based well abandonments; compare epoxy-based materials against cement abandonments; and determine whether epoxy material can effectively drop 7000 feet through a casing annuli and accumulate on top of the packer; how long material takes to travel to the bottom of a casing annuli and cure; how material performs over time, and how weighting of this material with BaSO4 affects the compressive and bond strength.  6. Inline Inspection of Low-pressure Low-volume (LPLV) In-service Gas Pipelines to Detect Wall Loss.Evaluate technologies to help develop or identify in-line inspections for use in detecting wall loss in low-pressure low-volume oil and gas pipelines.  Technology must be applied without use of a tether or addition of a fluid.7. Wet-welding Workshop Organize and hold workshop to identify challenges, developmental needs, and areas of research necessary to advance the design, processes, metallurgy, and inspection/repair of underwater welding applications; with specific attention to status of development and availability of wet-welding consumables and services; current applications and practices for underwater welding and inspection; limitations that hinder underwater applications; new and advanced technologies, and collaboration of international partners including manufactures, suppliers, repair and inspection service companies, standards writing organizations, regulators, and researchers.  The final workshop report will be compiled in the form of a proceedings book with broad distribution to the industry for further implementation of the technology.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE / SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance FAR Parts 5 and 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   FAR Part 6  Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.      

This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.
The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00. 

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 325998 with size standard of 500 employees.

Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that the sole / single source reference, is currently the only company that can provide the services / items specified herein. 

THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)  intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Sigma-Aldrich, 3050 Spruce Street, Saint Louis, MO 63103 for the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC1280), a collection of high quality, innovative molecules that span a broad range of cell signaling and neuroscience areas that are used to validate new drug discovery assays and characterize orphan receptors. 

The sole source determination is based upon the results of the market research conducted by the Government which determined that Sigma-Aldrich is the only  supplier of the LOPAC library.   There are no other companies that can supply the exact same collection of small molecule analogs with such well-defined pharmacological activities.  The collection as a whole is unique to Sigmas inventory and could not be supplied by any other vendor. Having this collection will allow us to validate high throughout screening assays against high, purity small organic ligands with well documented pharmacological activities.

<DESC>RECOVERY-THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER NAVAIR BOA N00019-05-G-0026.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a sole-source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) task order to McDonnell Douglas Corporation (A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company).  Recent direction has been received by NAVAIR to conduct a flight demonstration of an F/A-18E/F series aircraft using biofuel.  This effort supports the assessment of the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft and subsystems for operation using a 50/50 (equal parts) mixture of jet fuel and biofuel (blends of standard petroleum-derived jet fuel such as JP-5 mixed with a synthetically derived component, anticipated to be Hydro-Treated Renewable Jet (HRJ)). Anticipating a broader use of alternative fuels in the future, establishment of a protocol for clearing other McDonnell Douglas aircraft for operation on such fuels will enable estimation of work scope required to achieve that goal.  Specifically, the contractor shall:  a) define the capability of the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft and subsystems to operate on biofuel, support NAVAIR reviews with other system suppliers, and provide safe-for-flight recommendation by 28 FEB 2010 to support F/A-18 flight test evaluations by NAVAIR, b) identify tests and analyses considered necessary to determine the capability of all McDonnell Douglas aircraft currently in Navy service to operate on fuel made from an alternate source, c) provide corporate lessons learned from commercial introduction of biofuels, d) identify data and tests required to evaluate self-sealing fuel tanks for biofuels use in US Navy McDonnell Douglas aircraft in combat areas, e) conduct laboratory tests to quantify the dielectric constant of biofuel supplied by NAVAIR.  The effort shall be awarded as a firm fixed price order.  This award is based on Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), whereby the supplies or services required are available from only one source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  McDonnell Douglas is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and integrator of the F/A 18 aircraft in its various configurations and is the only source with the knowledge, technical data, and expertise necessary to fulfill the Governments requirements.  Points of contact for this announcement are: Contract Specialist Karen Johnston at (301)757-4224, karen.johnston@navy.mil and Contracting Officer Damon McGill at (301)757-7063, damon.mcgill@navy.mil.

The software utilized by the Training Control Unit (TCU) of the MFRTD is proprietary, and therefore can only be modified by the company that created it. RSCS is the original manufacturer of this equipment and is currently pursuing a patent for this technology. RSCS is the only company that presently has an integral knowledge of the product and software system; and award to any other vendor would result in a duplication of costs to the Government and an unacceptable time delay. 
Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received by 29 May 2009, at 5:00pm will be considered by the Government.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division (NSWCIHD) has recurring requirements for manufactured parts for the following programs: MK1, 12, 16 and 18 ROCAT; CKU 5, 7 and 10/11 ROCAT; MK 82/90; JAU 9; Under Seat Rocket Motors; SR 121 JATO; Roadrunner; MK 106, 109 and 79; PDRM; LTM; and various primer cups and anvils.  Due to the sensitive nature of these requirements and the high level of difficulty associated with manufacturing to the required specifications, NSWCIHD established a Qualified Bidders List (QBL) for select parts associated with these programs.  NSWCIHD intends to issue indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts to each vendor currently accepted on the QBL.  These contracts will be awarded as multiple award contracts (MACs) and each qualified vendor will receive a fair opportunity to compete for future QBL requirements for which they are qualified.  Any future changes to the QBL will be incorporated into the IDIQ contracts, either thro! ugh modifications to existing contracts or award of additional requirements.  As new vendors are qualified they will be offered IDIQ contracts under the same terms and conditions offered to all other QBL vendors.  The purpose of the IDIQ MACs is to facilitate rapid and cost-effective ordering from QBL vendors while maintaining and encouraging a competitive environment and developing long-term relationships with qualified vendors.  The ordering period for contracts issued in relation to this notice will initially be 10 years after contract award.  The NAICS code is 332995 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The FSC code is 1377.  
All interested vendors are encouraged to pursue admission to the QBL.  Qualification is ongoing and new vendors may be added at any time.  For information about the qualification process, please visit the NSWCIND website at http://www.ih.navy.mil.   From the list across the top of the main page, select Working with Us, Procurement, and then select Qualified Bidders List (QBL), from the list under QBL Documents click on QBL Adobe Document.
Qualification for some QBL parts that currently have two or more qualified small businesses will only be offered to small business concerns, but qualification on many parts will be offered on a full and open basis to help develop competition.  Full and open offerings will be reevaluated periodically.
A complete list of parts included in the QBL and their set-aside status is included in a separate attachment.   
Please include the solicitation number in the subject line of all emails regarding this requirement.  The government is not responsible for any undelivered email transmissions.
Note:  All offerors will be ineligible for award unless they have registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration  (CCR) database and completed the necessary representations and certifications for the NACIS code provided above within the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Information on CCR and ORCA is available through the Business Partner Network (BPN) at www.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>16TH NATIONAL TASC CONFERENCE ON DRUGS AND CRIME
<SOLNBR>SAM1964
<RESPDATE>052909
<CONTACT>Chris M. Ganey, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone 301-443-4379, Email CHRISTOPHER.GANEY@PSC.HHS.GOV
<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the National Treatment Accountability for Safer Communities.  

Background
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) has a lengthy history (1990-present) of providing funding for the treatment of individuals in the criminal justice system who have substance use and/or mental health disorders.  In the SAMHSA Priorities Matrix which drives the agencies budgeting, planning, and programming, Criminal and Juvenile Justice is listed as one of SAMHSAs program priority areas.  CSAT currently is funding substance use treatment services to offender populations in two primary settings:  treatment drug courts and offender reentry into the community.  

The acronym TASC stands for Treatment Accountability for Safer Communities.   TASC is a national program model that reduces addiction driven crime by linking local criminal justice systems to community-based treatment programs.  The TASC model was initiated in 1969, as one of the federal responses to the rise of drug related crime.  National TASC is the national membership organization serving the case-management professionals and it has 200 programs across the country.  In the past, TASC has organized twelve successful national conferences.  Given the value of the TASC model as an alternative to the incarceration, we believe support of this national meeting furthers SAMHSAs objectives of the knowledge exchange of screening, assessment, case management, and referral to treatment in order to more effectively treat the substance-using offender. 


The purpose of this contract is for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration/Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA/CSAT):
This Purchase Order request is to support the 16th National TASC Ninth Annual Conference on Drugs and Crime.  
It is anticipated that four hundred people will attend the conference from the Criminal Justice, Treatment, Social Services, Legislative, academic, and drug research fields.  The conference will be a forum for exchange of ideas and a showcase for the state-of-the-art technology and information on offender management, drug treatment programming, drug courts, offender re-entry, research, and information technology. As the theme implies, this years conference will focus on the community partnerships that are necessary to ensure the recovery and reentry of prior offenders.

The conference will feature tracks on reentry and recovery support, evidence based practices-practical applications for improved results; improving family health through prevention; TASC and problem solving courts and technology, connectivity and community responses. Additional workshops will include family-focused programs, front-end diversion, working with other systems, and working with scarce resources. Through plenary sessions, panel discussions, and training workshops, participants and sponsors will learn about the latest innovations and developments in juvenile/criminal justice/mental health case management.  In addition, conference attendees will have the opportunity to attend several pre-conference sessions for federal grantees and other subjects.

   
Specific purposes for the Purchase Order include: 

&#61507;	Demonstrating SAMHSAs support for the TASC offender case management model concept through the 16th National TASC Conference on Drugs and Crime. This will be accomplished through the use of the SAMHSA/CSAT logo and credit for sponsorship on all conference materials.

&#61507;	 Using this conference as a vehicle for more national recognition of and understanding of SAMHSAs matrix cross-cutting principles as they relate to the priority area of criminal justice programming.  A central focus will be on SAMHSAs support for new approaches to criminal justice-substance abuse treatment through its new justice portfolio of program initiatives, including re-Entry and restitution programs, family drug courts, offender reentry, and jail diversion of the co-occurring offender population. 

SAMHSA/CSAT will participate in the planning of the 16th National TASC Conference on Drugs and Crime in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The contractor shall plan (with SAMHSA/CSAT involvement) and implement the conference, provide a summary report describing the successes and weaknesses of the conference, and recommend next steps in training the TASC field. 
The National TASC is uniquely qualified to fulfill the tasks of this purchase order.  National TASC is a national membership organization with more than 200 programs nationwide. The 16th National TASC Conference on Drugs and Crime is being held by National TASC for its members and professionals in the field.  National TASC is highly skilled in managing these national conferences as it has successfully held twelve previous conferences, including last years 15th National Conference on Drugs and Crime in the Westin Michigan Avenue Hotel in Chicago Illinois last September.   National TASC is the sole organizer of their 16th National Conference on Drugs and Crime.  

Since the contract tasks involve more than simple logistical preparation for the conference, but also involves the selection of presenters with expert content knowledge specific to TASC, strength-based case management, screen and assessment of alcohol and drugs for criminally-involved offenders, referral to, and delivery of, substance abuse and co-occurring disorders treatment and the myriad issues related to the continuum of care for offenders reentering the community from prison this task cannot be performed by a normal conference logistics contractor.    For this unique operation and other activities described above, National TASC is the proper contractor who can provide the venue and accomplish these activities for CSAT.  
The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of Far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

For further information, please contact Chris Ganey in Rm. 5C-03, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857 or on 301-443-4379.

<DESC>General Services Administration seeks to lease office and related space consisting of approximately 11,407 rentable square feet of office and related area in Medford.  GSA is interested in considering alternative space if relocation is economically advantageous to the Government.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space.  Other factors impacting the Governments rights under a prospective lease, such as, the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.  The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire Safety, ABAAS, and ISC Requirements.  Property located within a base floodplain (100 year floodplain) or wetland will not be considered.  Space must be situated in Medford within a delineated area bounded as follows:  Crater Lake Highway and Delta Waters on the North; Hillcrest Road and East Jackson Street on the South; Foothill Road on the East; and, I-5 on the West.  

Twenty (20) surface parking spaces are also required.  A lease term of 10 years with a firm term of 5 years is sought.

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the buildings ownership.  If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, May 19, 2009.

Award of all contracts will be made within nine (9) months after award of the first contract provided there is sufficient workload. If necessary, the secondary selection criterion will be used as a tiebreaker between firms considered technically equal.  The following factors will be used in deciding which of the awarded AE firms  will be selected to negotiate task orders: performance and quality of deliverables under the current contract, current capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, uniquely specialized experience, and equitable distribution of work among the A/E firms. Significant emphasis will be placed on the A/Es quality control procedures, as the District will perform the Quality Assurance role only. Estimated start date is August 2009. To be eligible for award, a firm must have a DUNS number and be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, via the CCR Internet site at http://ccr.gov or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at (800) 334-3414.

The selected firms may be required to attend annual two-day partnering workshops, to define the Governments expectations of the A/E, create a positive working atmosphere, encourage open communication, and identify common goals. Cost for these sessions will be borne by the selected A/Es.<BR>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Projects may consist of A/E services for horizontal and vertical military projects and Civil Works projects with a large percentage (90%) of work anticipated being military projects.

The Grantee, the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Expansion of Meteorological Services in Ghana.
Forecasting services in Ghana are provided by GMet in conjunction with the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA).  The weather radar located at Kotoka International Airport is operated by GCAA and is functioning, but the ground stations reporting from outside the airport are limited in number, and their reports are prepared and disseminated manually.  This creates a safety issue for aviation users that do not have access to state of the art meteorological services to warn of approaching storms, which can be severe, or to detect the wind shear conditions at the airports that are common during severe storms.
The Grantee seeks to enhance its ability to produce timely forecasts and to disseminate either short or long term weather forecasts in an efficient manner.  The expansion of the Grantee's meteorological services will: (a) equip all airports with automated weather observation stations (AWOS) or radar surveillance; (b) input data collected into an automated meteorology database based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology; and (c) communicate meteorological information and weather forecasts efficiently to aviation, agricultural, energy producing, water resource and industrial users.  The Project will also establish a central Weather Forecast Office and enhance forecasting by the use of satellite and ground receiving and imaging systems.
This Feasibility Study is intended to (a) assess the hardware, software, and facilities requirements needed by the Grantee over the next 15 years to enable it to provide state-of-the-art weather forecasts and other meteorological services and (b) recommend changes to its organizational structure to optimize the analysis and dissemination of meteorological information.
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $235,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:
https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp
Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.
Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.
Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m. local time, July 17, 2009 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The estimated performance period for completion of construction is ONE HUNDRED TWELVE (112) calendar days after Notice to Proceed (NTP). If the performance period is changed prior to the release of the Solicitation, the resulting Solicitation will establish the official performance period under the FAR Clause 52.211-10 -- Commencement, Prosecution, and Completion of Work.

To be Technically Acceptable, SDVOSB Construction Firms who submit an offer must provide evidence that they have already performed at least ONE (1) construction project that involved: (a) Work as a Prime Contractor under the same NAICS code as this project (as listed below); and (b) Work of a dollar amount that falls within the exact same estimated magnitude of this project (as listed above).  FACTOR 2: TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS. To be Technically Acceptable, SDVOSB Construction Firms who submit an offer must provide information regarding the technical qualifications of the proposed project staff, to include the individuals who will be responsible for: (a) Project Management; (b) Quality Control; and (c) Safety Compliance. A brief resume of each key individual will be evaluated to determine if they meet the technical requirements for a project of this nature. It is acceptable for a single individual to perform more than one of these functions, as long as the proposal identifies which function(s) the individual will be performing. FACTOR 3: PRICE. As a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source selection, price is the most important factor in determining the award selection among those offers that are Technically Acceptable. Offers that are not Technically Acceptable cannot be selected, regardless of Price. NOTE: The resulting Solicitation will include an official detailed list of evaluation factors, including any applicable sub-factors or elements, and will provide detailed instructions for proposal submittal requirements, and the basis for award.

<DESC><p>This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification and production of a Modified Joint Fire Integrated Response Ensemble (JFIRE) for use by United States Air Force (USAF) fire fighting and emergency services personnel. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined. Vendors responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government will not reimburse vendors for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>1. A description of the JFIRE requirements and a Contractor Capability Survey, which allows you to provide your company's capability, is attached to this notice.</p>
<p>2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)</p>
<p>3. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research effort. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>
<p>4. Questions relative to this market research should be addressed to Abdeel J. Roman at (478) 222-1723.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The USAF is conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification and production of a Modified JFIRE for USAF fire fighting and emergency services personnel. Currently, the USAF is only procuring components for testing the requirements as outlined in the Requirements Correlation Matrix (RCM) and does not guarantee purchase of additional units. The projected requirements are approximately 6,000 JFIRE ensembles units in FY10-11.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The JFIRE is comprised of proximity jacket, proximity trousers, Joint Services Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST), helmet, boots and gloves. This solicitation only pertains to the modification of the JSLIST, helmet, boots and gloves.</p>
<p>The requirement for a new JFIRE system is driven by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards with which the Air Force must comply. The proposed new system must meet the criteria contained in the NFPA and OSHA standards. The JFIRE will enable firefighters to respond to emergencies in any contaminated environment, mitigate the situation and survive. The JFIRE will outfit firefighters in a personal protective ensemble that will allow highly effective response and mitigation of emergency incidents at home station and expeditionary locations worldwide. This capability will include emergencies involving fire, rescue, hazardous materials (HAZMAT), technical rescue, weapons of mass destructions (WMD), immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) atmospheres, and chemical/biological (CB) contaminated environments. Additionally, the new system must be compatible with the Air Force Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) - MSA FireHawk M7 Responder SCBA.</p>
<p>The Requirements Correlation Matrix (RCM), Part I is attached (Appendix A) to this Requirements Description. The RCM is a draft document and additional changes may be incorporated into the document as a result of input from the United States Air Force (USAF) and Industry. Threshold and Objective requirements have been established for each modified component. Components not meeting the minimum Threshold requirement will not be considered for this program. Vendors are encouraged to meet the Objective requirements set by the RCM. Vendors will be provided with details of testing requirements for each component at the meeting.</p>
<p>INDUSTRY DAY</p>
<p>The purpose of this meeting is to expand market research, and to provide additional information to industry on the JFIRE program. The Industry Day Meeting will also provide preliminary information on business/contract considerations, anticipated technical requirements, and obtain industry input/feedback. Industry input/feedback will be collected via index cards that will be provided during the conference. Any applicable responses to the input/feedback collected during Industry Day will be posted on the FedBizOpps website. The USAF is interested in mature technologies to modify the JFIRE components that are commercially available or will be commercially available within 12 months.</p>
<p>This meeting will be open to industries interested in modifications to any of the components listed in the description. Vendors may submit modifications for more than one component. The meeting will be held June 9, 2009 at San Antonio, TX. <br /><br />Crowne Plaza Riverwalk<br />111 East Pecan Street<br />San Antonio, TX 78208 <br />8888.233.9527<br />210.354.2800<br />Group room rate: $109 per night<br />Program name: USAF JFIRE Industry Day</p>
<p>Rooms may also be booked directly by clicking the link below. The link is set up with the conference information, dates and room rates.</p>
<p>https://resweb.passkey.com/go/FIREAFB</p>
<p>All attendees must confirm with Mr. Abdeel Roman at WR-ALC/642 CBSG by May 22 with the information requested below, as well as names, titles and citizenship of individuals attending. The Crowne Plaza will honor the group room rate until May 29th. After that date, vendors will be responsible for securing their own reservations.</p>

<SUBJECT>Blood Collection Tubes
<SOLNBR>APP-9-10-0812-01A
<RESPDATE>060409
<CONTACT>Cynthia Ingrao, Phone 619-532-8517, Email cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil
<DESC>A.	General Information

This is a reposting of this announcement.  Vendors that have responded to the previous posting dated February 3, 2009 do not have to resubmit their original response unless there is an update or change to it.

The Southwest Region will be standardizing Blood Collection Tubes.  This is a 5-year re-evaluation of this product group.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. This product line includes blood collection tubes for adult, pediatric and neonatal populations for chemistry, hematology, coagulation and specialty studies and testing.  The entire category of Blood Collection Tubes has an annual demand of over $162,000.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, Cardinal, currently serving Southwest Region.

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is September 2009.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Blood Collection Tubes. This product line includes blood collection tubes for adult, pediatric and neonatal populations for chemistry, hematology, coagulation and specialty studies and testing.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $162,000.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  

At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors

San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	Evaluation Criteria

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.
Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

If vendor has not had any of the above, so state.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.
The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples with literature must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the break, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria
1.	The tube is easily identified outside of its package.
a.	Technicians require the tube be easily identified outside of its package because tubes come in large volume packages and are stocked in each technicians caddy without the packaging.  They must be able to identify the tube outside of its packaging to be able to select the correct tube for the draw.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.
c.	Evaluator will be given tubes outside of their normal packaging and be able to identify the tube correctly using the information contained on the tube.

2.	The tubes closure can be removed with fingers or an extractor.
a.	Technicians require the tubes closure be removed with fingers or an extractor for withdrawal of the tubes contents for analysis.  Withdrawing the contents with a needle puts the technician at risk for a needlestick injury and may damage the contents.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.
c.	Evaluator will be given an unused tube and will attempt removal of the closure with fingers and/or an extractor.

3.	The tube has a surface that can be written on with a ballpoint pen with patient identification information.
a.	Technicians require the tube have a surface that can be written on with a ballpoint pen with patient identification information.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.
c.	Evaluator will be given an unused tube and will attempt to write on the surface provided on the tube with a ballpoint pen.

4.	The tube is compatible with the cap piercing capabilities of current analyzers.
a.	Technicians require the tube be compatible with the cap piercing capabilities of their analyzers so the contents of the tube can be withdrawn and analyzed.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.
c.	Evaluator will be given tubes they can use with their analyzers and perform the skill set necessary to perform and visualize the cap being pierced by the analyzer.

5.	The expiration date is easily visible on the tube packaging and individual tube.
a.	Clinicians require the expiration date be easily visible on the tube package and individual tube to insure expired product is not used on patients.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.
c.	Evaluator will inspect the tube package and individual tube and verify the expiration date is clearly printed on it.

Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples with literature for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the evaluation results become more technically equal, price may become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to issue a Prospectus to solicit proposals from interested parties on the next term of concession contracts for the development, operation and maintenance of visitor services and facilities at Lake Berryessa, Solano Project, Napa County, California (Lake Berryessa).  The Prospectus outlines business opportunities for six concession areas at Lake Berryessa to be provided by private individuals or companies in accordance with Reclamation's Record of Decision (ROD) for the Future Recreation Use and Operations of Lake Berryessa dated June 2, 2006.  Interim concession contracts between Reclamation and the existing concession contractors expire on the dates listed below:
Steele Park Resort         January 31,2010Markley Cove Resort      January 31,2011
The concession history at Lake Berryessa since 1959 and the issues that culminated from the previous 6 years of planning, completion of an Environmental Impact Statement, and the recent ROD as well as the expiration of the original six concession contracts at Lake Berryessa make this prospectus a unique document different in many ways from standard or traditional prospectuses that offerors may have previously seen.
Because of the significant changes mandated by the ROD, the concession opportunities at Lake Berryessa will result in new operations and a different commercial focus to the extent that visitor use patterns and the character of operations will be very different than they have been since the current contracts were authorized in 1958-1962.  At Lake Berryessa, all the facilities and services provided at the six concession areas have been re-described, through the identified planning process, in a manner that will result in business models and operations extremely different from the historical Lake Berryessa concession operations.  Furthermore, the plan and the associated ROD purposefully described the new operations in a somewhat global approach that provides a very flexible and many-faceted set of business opportunities for bidders wishing to compete for a concession contract(s).   The Prospectus therefore places a high premium on creativity by the bidders because there are many options available for them to work within.
Reclamation will select successful bidders based in part upon the proposal(s) that appears to have the most reasonable approach for:  (1) serving the publics' demand for quality water-based recreation support services and facilities, (2) protecting the environment, (3) responding positively to the 'Principal Factors' and 'Criterions' outlined in the prospectus, and (4) introducing an integrated business approach as identified in the ROD and in the prospectus, all while demonstrating a well-developed financial projection for a reasonable profit.
Any offer, including that of existing concession contractors, must be received by the Bureau of Reclamation, Central California Area Office, 7794 Folsom Dam Road, Folsom, California 95630 by the proposal due date in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract under the terms described in the Prospectus.  The Prospectus will be issued May 15, 2009 for a 91-day response period, with proposals due no later than 2:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time on August 14, 2009.  
The Prospectus, draft contract and all supporting documentation is available at the Lake Berryessa Prospectus website:

<DESC><p>Sources Sought <br />Ref# 2009-70200
<p>This is not a Solicitation. This is a Sources Sought advertisement. This notice is to maximize competition. The National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) is requesting information to determine the availability of qualified contractors to develop a Brief Motivational Intervention (BMI) training guide along with supporting materials.</p>
<p>Contractor Qualifications:<br />Must have experience in substance abuse training and development or related field.<br />Must have at least a Masters Degree, PhD preferred.</p>
<p>The contractor will perform the following:</p>
<p>1. Revise the BMI script: Condense and summarize the current BMI training guide into a brief script that is a single page in length. This one-page script should be reproducible as a pocket guide for health workers to use while on the job. Two versions of the revised BMI script will be produced camera-ready for reproduction: 1) A pocket-guide version for double-sided printing and laminating, and 2) a patient handout version suitable for duplicating on a copier for distribution to patients.</p>
<p>2. Develop alternate gradients as substitutes for "rulers" <br />Several trainers and country experts have expressed concern that some healthcare clients may not be familiar with "rulers" and that other forms of expression should be developed which may be more easily understood. Several alternate forms of scales will be developed to show gradient measures which may be familiar to clients in term of objects and choices in everyday life. Several options have been considered including the use of circles with increasing degrees light vs. darkness, steps on a ladder, groups of objects (pebbles) of increasing numbers, and liquid or sand containers with varying degrees of emptiness.</p>
<p>3. Produce videos of BMI <br />Produce a BMI video based on role-play scenarios utilizing BMI training. The scenarios should be video-taped to capture demonstrations of the correct method of implementing the BMI intervention. The BMI will be broken into components for videotaping so that trainers can use the video for training of each section separately, and to focus on sections that may require more repetition or review. Several scenarios of BMI implementation should be taped, including a bad example showing how NOT to conduct a motivational intervention. Case examples will be shown including patients at special risk, unmotivated patients, and patients ready for work on cutting back or abstaining from drinking</p>
<p>4. Develop Trainer Guide<br />A trainer guide will be developed to include a PowerPoint presentation for the BMI training. Trainer notes will be provided for each slide, and a separate training instruction booklet will be provided to give trainers overall directions about preparing for and conducting the training. This will also include examples of training exercises, case scenarios, training schedules, and evaluation forms. Evaluation forms will include a consent statement, pre and post training surveys, debriefing questions for key participants, and a follow-up form to assess post training implementation. The guide will also provide advice about refresher courses and sustained implementation through supervision and organizational support. Procedures will be provided for recommended workplace audio-taping of BMI sessions for supervisory review. An agency checklist for supporting Healthcare worker utilization of the BMI will be provided.</p>
<p>5. Develop trainee materials<br />A trainee package will be developed to include a copy of the PowerPoint slides, the training agenda, a brief statement of rationale for use of BMI by healthcare workers in Namibia, a summary of current research evidence supporting the effectiveness of BMI, reference materials about BMI, and other handouts. An electronic copy of a poster will be provided to facilitate discussion of health conditions that make it advisable to abstain from any alcohol use. The trainee materials will also include advice about forming peer support groups to encourage sustained implementation, and the need for organizational and supervisory support</p>
<p>6. Produce integrated training package<br />The total training package will be assembled in an integrated kit which will include the trainers guide, participant materials, DVD with role-play examples, BMI pocket guide, BMI patient handout, and other materials. The package will include overall editing and revisions, page layout, art work, and consistent formatting throughout. The package will have a table of contents for identifying where various components may be found. A flash drive will be provided for electronic copies of all written materials.</p>
<p>No quotes are needed at this time. This is a research tool to determine the availability of sources that can provide the services described above. In order to do business with the U.S. government a contractor must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). This registration may be obtained at the following link, http://www.ccr.gov/<br />This advertisement ends in 5 days. Any interested companies or persons are welcomed to provide their credentials and ability to provide the services, via e-mail, gqq4@cdc.gov<br />Include reference number 2009-70200</p>

The estimated cost is $ 1 to 2 million and we expect construction work to start early September 2009 and finish around February 2010.  There are possible Mexican Spotted owls & Peregrine Falcons nesting within the project limits that will restrict construction activities. 

This is a difficult construction project in a short construction season located in very steep and rocky terrain.   No formal detailed road closures, except for 30 minute delays, will be in effect as all construction activities will require maintaining existing traffic flow.

<CONTACT>E. Lynn Carr-Hawkes, Contracting Officer, Phone 7035622220, Fax 7035622553, Email ecarrhawkes@fdic.gov
<DESC><p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is seeking sources indicating interest in developing and producing 55 paper-based residential real estate, commercial real estate, and commercial loan files that match corresponding loan information in an existing database or fictitious bank policies. This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This notice may be canceled at any time, and may not result the issuance of an RFP or award of a contract. <br />However, this information will be used to create a list of qualified and interested vendors for a future solicitation. Companies are invited to submit information describing their experience and their capabilities with regard to the requirements listed below.
<p>The loan files will be used to supplement the training program to familiarize employees with the various documents included in a loan file. The paper-based bank loan files must correspond to data in an existing web-based database and must approximate loan files found in a bank. The paper-based loan files combined with the existing database will allow employees to develop skills in a cost-effective, dynamic framework. The employees will need to determine whether all required documents are in the file, locate information in the documents, determine whether the loan terms are in keeping with bank policies, identify deficiencies related to each document, etc. The training will teach employees how to: 1) pool and market loans for sale, 2) value loans, 3) examine loans, and 4) manage loans.</p>
<p>The loan files will need to include approximations of the following: <br />&bull; corresponding loan officer notes<br />&bull; pledged collateral<br />&bull; credit reports<br />&bull; appraisals<br />&bull; environmental reports<br />&bull; tax returns<br />&bull; legal documents<br />&bull; insurance policy<br />&bull; promissory notes<br />&bull; surveys<br />&bull; financial statements<br />&bull; blueprints<br />&bull; loan payment history<br />&bull; security agreements<br />&bull; amortization schedules<br />&bull; loan applications, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Work:</strong></p>
<p>Corporate University (Corp U) is the training and employee development arm of the FDIC and supports the Corporation's mission and business objectives through high quality, cost effective continuous learning and development. Corp U provides opportunities for employees to enhance their sense of corporate identity while learning more about FDIC's major program areas of supervision, compliance, resolutions and insurance. Corp U leverages technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of training FDIC employees. Corp U uses a blended training program to develop, capture, maintain, and transfer essential and mission critical knowledge, skills and abilities for its employees.</p>
<p>The FDIC is committed to using methods and techniques to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its training programs. The 55 loan files must match corresponding loan information in the existing database and fictitious bank policies. The files will need to be in both electronic and hard copy forms. The electronic files will be archived on a web site to allow for easy accessibility. The hard copy documents will be organized in file folders with tabs and shipped to the FDIC's Dallas, TX office. It is expected that the contractor shall create the forms and documents without referencing actual loan files because of privacy law or recreate an existing loan file with all identifying data changed so it cannot be referenced back to the borrower's actual identify. All financial data will be fictitious as well as the graphics depicted in the loan files.</p>
<p>Financial data for the loan files will be created as electronic files. Most documents needed outside the software suite will be created from scratch, providing only rudimentary data. For example, the appraisal documents will only need to include the: date of the appraisal, appraised value, and appraisal method/approaches. Likewise, an environmental report will only need to indicate: the phase of the report, test date(s), test results, conclusions, and recommendations. Other documents such as a credit report will need to include information sufficient to determine the borrower's credit and employment history. The actual numbers and types of collateral documents will vary considerably, depending on the loan type. The contractor shall determine the contents of and develop the contents for each loan file. All loan files shall be state of Texas loans and conform to the fictitious bank policies as well as the fictitious data keys already developed.</p>
<p>At no cost to the FDIC and to the extent mutually agreeable between the FDIC and participating vendors, demonstrations of loan files may be requested. Demonstration sessions can provide an opportunity for more questions to be answered.</p>

<a href="mailto:tardiffc@mms.gov">Tardiff, Christy C</a>
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:This announcement solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program on Safety of Renewable Energy Operations on the US Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research.  For a summary of TA&R research recently performed, visit http://www.mms.gov/tarprojectcategories/AlternativeEnergy.htm .
BACKGROUND:   
The MMS TA&R Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement.  Selected white papers will be requested to submit proposals.  Proposals selected for funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2010.  The MMS anticipates that $500,000 may be available for the initiation of new research addressing topics identified through this announcement.  NOTICE:  The MMS may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify the MMS if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared.     
OBJECTIVE:  The topics for the FY 2010 renewable energy research funding should be limited to the following topics: 
1. Evaluate the Effect of Turbine Period of Vibration Requirements on Structural Design Parameters.Most turbine manufactures specify period of vibration requirements to avoid accelerated fatigue (avoidance of resonance conditions with both rotor and blade passing frequencies).  Resonance avoidance may dominate the design requirements for many conditions. The section properties that are required to ensure resonance avoidance result in high ultimate strength capacity.  What is the range of vibration requirements specified by the various manufacturers?  What effect would a direct-drive turbine, vertical axis turbine, or other proposed technology have on these requirements?
2.  Evaluate seabed scouring, the effect of shifting sediments & sand waves, and soil disturbance caused by inner-array cable installation on the design and operation of an offshore wind farm.Many of the areas currently proposed for future offshore wind farms are located in areas of high sediment transport rates and sand waves.  It is anticipated that inner-array cables will be laid via a jet-plow method that exposes a six foot deep trench.  
3.  Assess/evaluate potential methods to accomplish Close Visual Inspections (from less than an arms length distance away) of wind turbine blades once installed in an offshore environment.  TA&R project #627 http://www.mms.gov/tarprojects/627.htm developed preliminary inspection methodologies for offshore wind farms.  Follow up research is required to evaluate the potential methods for a Close Visual Inspection of the turbine blades.
4.  Determine methods to evaluate the verticality of wind turbine towers during annual inspections.  TA&R project #627 http://www.mms.gov/tarprojects/627.htm developed preliminary inspection methodologies for offshore wind farms.  Follow up research is required to establish the appropriate methodology to assess the verticality of the wind turbine(i.e., does the facility lean due to structural deformation, differential settlement, or other causes).
5.  Provide cost estimates for future alternative energy projects (wind/wave/current) on the U.S. OCS.  It is necessary for MMS to have estimated costs of the installation of various offshore alternative energy projects.  These costs will be further used to estimate the cost to decommission the project at the end of its useful life.  It is not necessary to include the actual costs of structural components of the projects, but rather the costs to put these components into service, i.e. device transport and installation, cable installation, etc.
HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Ms. Christy Tardiff, not later than June 22, 2009 at 04:00 PM, EDT. WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort.  NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE WHITE PAPER.  The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merits.  IF YOUR WHITE PAPER IS SELECTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION, A TECHNICAL AND COST/BUSINESS PROPOSAL WILL BE REQUESTED BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FROM YOUR COMPANY.  Projects shall be selected from all or part of the technical issues listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received.  The MMS shall evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit shall be furnished information to assist in the preparation of the complete proposal.

<CONTACT>Kathy Gatewood Clark, Contract Specialist, Phone 303-497-3870, Fax 303-497-3163, Email kathy.clark@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.<br />The following Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for Market Research purposes in planning of a possible requirement for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admintration (NOAA). It does not constitute a Request for Quote. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admintration is not accepting offers at this time nor will the information provided be evaluated or considered as an offer. This RFI does not commit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admintration to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admintration will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred by a contractor in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is investigating available options to add up to 13 (1 immediate w/options for 12 additional) radars to the current NEXRAD network of WSR-88D radars. The NWS is seeking options to expand the NEXRAD network using radars of; (1) a new design, (2) existing commercial design, (3) a hybrid design including elements of new design and existing commercial design, or (4) a hybrid design using elements of a new design and/or existing commercial design along with current WSR-88D design elements. The objective of this effort will be to expand the network with a number of S-band; dual polarized radars that are compatible with the NEXRAD fleet and provide data of a comparable quality to the WSR-88D. The system will be operated by NWS personnel and the equipment will ultimately be maintained by technicians familiar with maintenance of the WSR-88D, or by contract. In addition to performance, operability, and compatibility, "cost of ownership" will also be considered in selecting an option to support this requirement. The timeline for the procurement of the first radar is relatively short. FY09 funding is programmed for preliminary planning with the bulk of funding programmed in FY10 to support contract award for design, build, and install of the first radar. The first system is scheduled to be operational in FY12.</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL: Since deployment in the 1990's, the WSR-88D design has been upgraded to improve performance, remove obsolete parts, and insert new technology. This design evolution has resulted in the migration from dedicated computers and display systems to an "open architecture" using commercial digital signal processors and commercial servers running Redhat Enterprise O/S, commercial displays, and commercial network communication equipment including routers. However, there are critical subsystems such as the transmitter, pedestal, and pedestal electronics that have received only incremental design changes and generally reflect design elements typical of the late 1980s. These are referred to as legacy design elements. These legacy elements are no longer commercially available, which removes the option of expanding the NEXRAD network using additional WSR-88D radars.<br /><br />1.1 Additional WSR-88D information is available at an FTP site managed by the WSR-88D Radar Operations Center. The address is: ftp://ftp.roc.noaa.gov/Pub/RFI</p>
<p>2.0 DESIRED RADAR CHARACTERISTICS:</p>
<p>2.1 Compatibility- The design must provide data that is compatible with, and comparable to that produced by the existing NEXRAD radar fleet. The radar design must not induce any faults in the portions of the legacy design proposed to be retained.</p>
<p>2.2 Effectiveness- The design must provide data of a quality comparable to that of the WSR-88D.</p>
<p>2.3 Operability- The design must be capable of being operated by meteorological personnel familiar with operation of the WSR-88D following 80 hours of instruction.</p>
<p>2.4 Supportability- The design must minimize the use of restricted data rights or otherwise provide the government with sufficient license to procure parts from other than a single source. The Government must have sufficient rights to maintain and modify, as necessary, a technical data package reflecting the design. The design should use technology that will be broadly commercially available for at least 5 years beyond system delivery.</p>
<p>2.5 Ease of Maintenance- The proposed design must provide elements (self-diagnostics, modular design, etc.) that would support the identification and replacement of failed components with minimal specialized tools, training, or test equipment required.</p>
<p>2.6 Reliability- The proposed system must achieve an Operational Availability of not less than 96%, as is required of the WSR-88D. <br /><br />3. RESPONSES. Responses to this RFI must include discussions of a commercial, or hybrid design or design strategy, which meets the intent of NWS objective and addresses the characteristics listed in paragraph 2.0 above. Responses must also include a statement regarding current availability, estimated time to deliver after contract award (if not currently available), estimated price of the product. This RFI does not constitute an invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes. The responses to this RFI will be evaluated to determine solution options available in the commercial marketplace. A follow-up RFI will likely be issued prior to the RFQ. The RFQ would have to be published in FY10 to support the current schedule. This is not a request for proposal and there is no solicitation available. Responses shall be submitted via email by June 15, 2009 by 1:00 p.m. MST. Telephone responses are not acceptable.</p>

<DESC><p>SECTION C - STATEMENT OF WORK/SPECIFICATION
<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984 (Title III of Pub.L. 98-623, 16 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) Provides the legislative authority necessary to implement, with respect to the United States, the Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program. The AMLR Program, which is managed by the Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division (AERD) at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), provides information to the U.S. delegation to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), part of the Antarctic treaty system.</p>
<p>CCAMLR is an international treaty between 23 nations that seeks to manage Antarctic fisheries with the goal of preserving species diversity and stability of Antarctic marine ecosystems. In keeping with this objective, CCAMLR has designated areas of research that member nations are obligated to pursue. The AMLR Program has identified specific data sets that must be collected to respond to CCAMLR's research directives. In doing so, the AMLR Program supports the U.S. Government's commitment to CCAMLR.</p>
<p>In 1996/97, the AMLR Program established a field camp at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. As part of U.S.-AMLR commitments to CCAMLR and the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program, the trophic relationships of krill-dependent predators are monitored annually. Antarctic fur seals are a conspicuous krill-dependent predator of the Antarctic marine ecosystem. Every year the U.S. AMLR program collects over 100 milk samples from foraging lactating fur seals. The fatty acid profiles extracted from the lipid of these samples reveal information on their dietary origins. Each sample provides information on what an individual seal ate prior to sample collection. At the same time samples of seal milk are being collected on shore samples of prey are collected offshore by the U.S. AMLR oceanographic research vessel. Establishing trophic-links and identifying predator-prey relationships assists managers and policy makers in their attempts to regulate and sustain fishery exploitation and resource use.</p>
<p>II. PURPOSE<br /><br />A. Overall Program Objectives</p>
<p>The AMLR Program monitors finfish, crab, and krill fisheries, projects sustainable yields where possible, and formulates management advice and options. In addition, the Program conducts field research designed to describe the functional relationships between krill (Euphausia superba), their predators, and key environmental variables.</p>
<p>B. Specific Study Objectives</p>
<p>The objectives of the research covered by this contract include the following:</p>
<p>(1) To GC-analyze (on a Perkin Elmer gas chromatograph) predator and prey fatty acid samples in duplicate;</p>
<p>(2) Samples will include milk from Antarctic fur seals (predator) and multiple species of prey to include but not limited to Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), Myctophid fish (Electrona antarctica, Electrona carlsbergi, Gymnoscopelus nicholsi), unidentified squid species, and other fish species (Pluerogramma antarcticum, Notolepis coatsi);</p>
<p>(3) Sample analysis includes GC correcting each gas chromatograph using PE-Turbochrome software or an equivalent correcting program;</p>
<p>(4) Any Myctophid fish samples will also be additionally processed using the Jones-method for converting wax esters to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME);</p>
<p>(5) Contractor will provide all data results in excel formatted files.</p>
<p><br />III. CONTRACT TASKS</p>
<p>A. TASKS</p>
<p>1. GC-analyze (on a Perkin Elmer gas chromatograph) predator and prey FAME samples in duplicate;</p>
<p>2. Sample analysis includes GC correcting each gas chromatograph using PE-Turbochrome software or an equivalent correcting program;</p>

The U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions and Contracting Command, is issuing this Sources Sought Notice on behalf of the U.S. Army ARDEC.  The U.S. Army is conducting a market survey to identify vendors capable of producing an Automatic Test System (ATS) with the capabilities required to support testing a fault diagnosis of the electronic and electro-optic components from the Armys weapons platforms, including missile, aviation and ground combatsystems.  The ATS shall be compatible with the current test program sets hardware/software and offer improved capabilities that implement the common hardware and software architecture standards and guidelines resulting from the DoD Joint Services Agile Rapid Global Combat Support (ARGCS) System Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD).  The system shall also support the Army logistics transformation initiatives such as Global Combat Support System Army (GCSSA), Common Logistics Operating Environment CLOE, Net centricity, and improve diagnostics by supporting Smart Test Program Set TPS development.  The system must consolidate the capabilities and mission requirements of all current army ATS into one test system. It will replace the Direct Support Electrical System Test Set (DSESTS), IFTE BSTF (V) 3, and IFTE BSTF (V) 5.The system will support the existing TPS hardware and software for each of the aforementioned testers without modification to the existing TPS hardware.  Initially, the system should possess all of the technical test capability of the Direct Support Electrical System Test Set DSESTS, BSTF (V) 3 and Electro Optics Test Facility EOTF less electro-optics, however it should be readily upgradeable to EO test capability by simple integration of an Electro-Optics subsystem. The NGATS shall implement the Joint Service DoD NxTest Open Architecture, be NetCentric compatible, and compliant with the DoD Common Test Interface (CTI). The system shall use an open architecture and VXI instrumentation while consisting of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products where available and cost effective. The system shall permit rapid reconfiguration and flexibility along with easy replacement of instruments as they become obsolete. This system shall be compliant with current IFTE and Direct Support Electrical System Test Set (DSESTS) Abbreviated Test Language for All Systems (ATLAS) to increase backward compatibility with currently developed Test Program Sets (TPS) and current industry standard commercially available TPS development software packages  and National Instruments Test Standards for future TPS development. The tactical configuration of the system shall be designed to be housed and operated by the standard ISO 20 form factor without modifications which interfere with loading and handling by current standard commercial and military container handling equipment.  Weight shall not exceed 10,000 LBS GROSS.  The system must meet the current requirements for theater air transportability in C130 aircraft.  The Program Director-Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment  (PD-TMDE) is interested in reviewing possible design options, performance information, and material solutions for the proposed system.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the government. The United States Coast Guard (USCG), Civil Engineering Unit (CEU), has a future requirement for fungal detoxification of PCB-contaminated soils at the former Long Range Navigation (LORAN) station at Kure Atoll The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for work of this nature is 562211(Size Standard: $12.5 million). The government is seeking potential contractors with the ability to provide fungal detoxification of PCB contaminated soil using a  fungi-bearing hydrogel formulation that: 1) can support the growth and propagation of mycelia of saprophytic fungi collected from Hawaiian rain forests; and 2) can degrade recalcitrant contaminants including PCBs, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and diesel fuel.  The Coast Guard wishes to apply this hydrogel formulation to Kure landfill soils, in order to evaluate its PCB-degrading ability.

In a future requirement, the successful Contractor will be required to provide the necessary services, personnel, facilities, equipment, and material (except those specifically designated as Government-furnished) to perform the work and provide scientific and technical expertise for the areas described herein.  All work will be conducted in strict compliance with EPA regulations (40 CFR 761), Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) standards (29 CFR 1910 and 1926), and State of Hawaii regulations.

The successful Contractor will be responsible for coordinating all phases of work with all Federal, State, Coast Guard personnel and all subcontractors, to ensure implementation of the project, and shall strive to meet its purpose and objectives.  This will include, but not limited to, meetings, conference calls, clearances, and other coordination activities necessary for successful completion of this scope of work.  

The successful Contractor will be responsible for obtaining all necessary permits, permit equivalents and certifications; and shall meet the substantive regulatory requirements necessary for the construction, operation and closure of the project.  If at all possible, the successful Contractor shall obtain permits under the permit-by-rule requirements to expedite the permitting process for this demonstration project.

The successful Contractor must be able to provide a pilot-scale study with the referenced fungi-induced bioremediation (mycoreremediation).  The successful Contractor must be able to demonstrate the process and effectiveness of mycoreremediation to 1) degrade PCB soil contamination resulting from past operations at Kure; and 2) reduce soil PCB concentrations to acceptable human health and ecological levels.  One specific area of interest will be to assess the effectiveness of the fungi to biodegrade PCBs to cleanup levels based on environmental exposure criteria (e.g., the State of Hawaii Environmental Action Level of 1.1 parts per million), within the proposed treatment period.  

The government contemplates the award of a firm fixed-price contract resulting from the future solicitation. Market Research is being conducted to determine interest and capability of potential sources for this requirement. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary, the government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the government. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation and/or amendments, will be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information regarding this sources-sought announcement. The response date for the market survey is May 25, 2009. No collect calls will be accepted. No telephone request or written requests for the Market Survey will be accepted. All responses to the Market Survey Questionnaire may be submitted via email to Contract Specialist, Stephanie Garnett at Stephanie.M.Garnett@uscg.mil.   Please note: All contractors doing business with the Federal Government must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The website for registration is www.ccr.gov.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />The 99th Medical Group, Nellis AFB Las Vegas, NV, 89191 requires the purchase of the Centricity Perinatal software support agreement for maintenance and support. The 99th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to make an award to GE Healthcare Bioscience Bioprocess Corp. of 800 Centennial Ave., Piscataway, NJ 08854. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@nellis.af.mil or fax 702-652-5405, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Friday, 22 May 2009; 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time.<br />Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:<br />22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
<p>The OB Inpatient Unit at Nellis AFB uses a combination of hardware and software, purchased from GE Healthcare for monitoring and documentation of all care for labor and antepartum patients. To improve the performance and flexibility of the overall system, a SSA (Software Support Agreement) must be purchased. GE Healthcare is the only company that can provide this SSA (Software Support Agreement). Nellis AFB has already invested approximately $68,000 into the entire OB project. Procuring this type of software from any company, other than GE, would require purchasing new hardware and software, negating all of the money that has already been invested in the OB project. In summary, to procure this type of software from any other company, other than GE Healthcare, would result in substantial duplication of costs, not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;Industry input. NAICS: 517110. The 38 Engineering Installation Group (EIG) is requesting feedback and best practices regarding the regionalization of local exchange telephone services for all U.S. AF sites within the states of AL, FL, GA, NC and SC. The Government intends to issue a solicitation resulting in multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts to all offerors who meet the requirements. Local exchange services include analog and digital access transport services and intra-Local Access Transport Area (LATA) interconnect functions the AF. The Contractor shall provide all transmission facilities, equipment, materials, maintenance, test equipment, and design layout needed to perform and provide local access and transport services and functions at the designated demarcation point. The contractor will be responsible for troubleshooting and maintaining the operation of the circuit up to its termination point. Access to the local exchange shall include: operator assistance, directory assistance (DA), and emergency 911/E911 services and functions. These services do not include residential/business services for non-Government entities or Government Contractors nor long distance services. For AF recruiters and smaller AF sites, only a portion of the services listed above will be required, particularly those sites that do not have an AF base telephone switch and are subject to standard commercial practices. The IDIQ contracts' performance period will be five years, with up to five additional option periods (for a potential total 10-year contract life). Each responsive/responsible offeror receiving an award will be guaranteed a designated minimum (possibly one site) within the region issued via task order. The task orders will be issued for a period of 5 years using Fair Opportunity procedures. The Government's intent is to eventually implement this regionalization concept to satisfy AF local exchange service needs nationwide.</p>
<p>The firm-fixed priced proposals for the site specific task orders will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.101-2 (IAW FAR 13.106-2(b), 14.201-5(c), and 15.204-5(c))</p>
<p>For the purpose of task order awards, offers will be evaluated for acceptability of evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1: Technical<br />FACTOR 2: Cost/Price</p>
<p>a. Order of Importance<br />Factors 1 and 2 are of equal importance.</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology<br />Offers will be listed from lowest to highest price. After price is evaluated the technical acceptability evaluation will begin; starting with the lowest evaluated priced offeror. The first proposal evaluated as technically acceptable will be considered the best value proposal and all other technical evaluations will cease.</p>
<p>c. Technical Factor</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offeror's shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for a IDIQ contract award.</p>
<p>d. Cost/Price Factor<br />(1) The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by multiplying the proposed unit price by the total quantity.</p>
<p>(2) Unrealistically low proposed const/prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p><br />Submit comments or best practices pertaining to this RFI to the e-mail address(es) above. Submit all questions to above e-mail address(es) no later than noon, CST, 22 May 09.</p>

<DESC><p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is planning to release the ATHENA Program Broad Agency Announcement (IARPA-BAA-09-03) in late June 2009.  This program is classified at the TOP SECRET/ Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) level. In anticipation of this release, all potential bidders are required to provide a response to this notice so that IARPA can establish temporary Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) Co-use Agreements.  This temporary co-use will allow potential bidders the ability to receive and prepare responses to this BAA, and will remain in effect throughout the pre-award phase of the program.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: For this program, companies without an existing SCIF will be unable to receive the BAA. Those companies without approved SCIF facilities who are interested in performing on this program may wish to explore teaming options with companies that have existing SCIFs, classified storage, and classified information systems. Based on information provided by the potential bidder, IARPA will make all reasonable attempts to have co-use agreements established; however, the Government cannot guarantee a co-use can be established for each SCIF. Hence, early submission of information will provide the best potential for successful co-use processing. A future announcement regarding availability of the BAA will be sent directly to those vendors who have received co-use agreement approval. IARPA will contact the Primary Point of Contact to announce BAA availability using the unclassified e-mail address provided.</p>
<p>Interested potential bidders are required to provide the following information to assist in the establishment of the requisite co-use agreement:</p>
<p>Company Name:<br />SCIF Address:<br />SCIF Room Number(s):<br />SCIF Sponsor:<br />SCIF ID Number:<br />Facility Waivers (if yes, list waivers):<br />Level of Facility Accreditation (TS/SI required):<br />Level of Classified Storage (TS/SI required):<br />Open/Close Storage:<br />Level of Information Systems (IS) Processing?<br />Courier System Utilized:<br />Courier Address:<br />Security Officer Name(s):<br />Security Officer Contact Information (unclassified and classified e-mail/phone):<br />Primary Point of Contact (unclassified and classified e-mail/phone):</p>
<p>All responses should be directed, via secure channels, to schalot@dni.ic.gov. Responses should be sent as soon as possible, but must be received no later than 5:00EST, 29 May 2009. Those potential bidders planning to utilize multiple SCIFs must provide the above information for each facility.</p>
<p>If, for any reason the requested information cannot be provided through the electronic address above, potential bidders should contact IARPA Security, at (301) 226-9101/9003 to make arrangements to send the information via other means (i.e. hand carry, fax, etc.).</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT  -  Brand Name Justification for Microsoft Software Enterprise License Agreement and Maintenance

The Internal Revenue Service intends to award a purchase order for commercial items.  We will be issuing an order to a Federal Supply Service (FSS) schedule contractor.  This purchase order will be made under the Authority of FAR Part 11.105 and FAR Part 52.211-6  -  Brand Name or Equal.  The IRS is requesting software maintenance renewal for Informatica software for the DITE project requirement for existing licenses.  This purchase is for the support for PRIME, for the Modernization program in MTC  DITE.  The DITE project is a large Modernization project and they require Informatica software to use in a non-production, test only environment to satisfy their security and software requiremens.  

The Informatica software is already purchased and has been installed at the IRS for the use with the DITE project.  No other software has been found that can meet the needs of the Service.  Removal and replacement of the Informatica software would be costly and would cause the DITE project to potentially crash as replacement software would not be able to perform all of the functions of the Informatica Software.  This requirement is for software maintenance to ensure that any problems with the existing software can be fixed in a timely manner.  It will also enable upgrades to the software to be received and installed in the current operating environment.  

The selected product must be capable of complying with the IRS Enterprise Architecture and specifically be able to integrate within the native Active Directory environment in order to be able to scale to enterprise levels and be able to be supported and managed with limited resource overhead.   The maintenance and software assurance will be applied to all IRS laptop and desktop computers connected to the IRS network and also standalone.  The delivery order will be fulfilled by one GSA FSS schedule contractor.  Questions can be e-mailed 
Mary.mudd@irs.gov.

The following basic policy is established for all Government agencies with respect to inventions hereafter made by any Government employee:<br />(a) The Government shall obtain the entire right, title and interest in and to all inventions made by any Government employee (1) during working hours, or (2) with a contribution by the Government of facilities, equipment, materials, funds, or information, or of time or services of other Government employees on official duty, or (3) which bear a direct relation to or are made in consequence of the official duties of the inventor.<br />(b) In any case where the contribution of the Government, as measured by any one or more of the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) last above, to the invention is insufficient equitably to justify a requirement of assignment to the Government of the entire right, title and interest to such invention, or in any case where the Government has insufficient interest in an invention to obtain entire right, title and interest therein (although the Government could obtain some under paragraph (a), above), the Government agency concerned, subject to the approval of the Chairman of the Government Patents Board (provided for in paragraph 3 of this order and hereinafter referred to as the Chairman), shall leave title to such invention in the employee, subject, however, to the reservation to the Government of a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention with power to grant licenses for all governmental purposes, such reservation, in the terms thereof, to appear, where practicable, in any patent, domestic or foreign, which may issue on such invention.<br />(c) In applying the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b), above, to the facts and circumstances relating to the making of any particular invention, it shall be presumed that an invention made by an employee who is employed or assigned (i) to invent or improve or perfect any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, (ii) to conduct or perform research, development work, or both, (iii) to supervise, direct, coordinate, or review Government financed or conducted research, development work, or both, or (iv) to act in a liaison capacity among governmental or nongovernmental agencies or individuals engaged in such work, or made by an employee included within any other category of employees specified by regulations issued pursuant to section 4(b) hereof, falls within the provisions of paragraph (a), above, and it shall be presumed that any invention made by any other employee falls within the provisions of paragraph (b), above. Either presumption may be rebutted by the facts or circumstances attendant upon the conditions under which any particular invention is made and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall not preclude a determination that the invention falls within the provisions of paragraph (d) next below.<br />(d) In any case wherein the Government neither (1) pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a) above, obtains entire right, title and interest in and to an invention nor (2) pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) above, reserves a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention with power to grant licenses for all governmental purposes, the Government shall leave the entire right, title and interest in and to the invention in the Government employee, subject to law.<br />(e) Actions taken, and rights acquired, under the foregoing provisions of this section, shall be reported to the Chairman in accordance with procedures established by him.<br />2.

Sharma to perform interventional radiology medical research and biomedical tissue
engineering research studies related to formulation and implementation of
animal model experiments for novel drug delivery technologies such as drug
eluting beads and imageable beads as well as thrombolytic vectors for therapy. Dr.
Sharma&rsquo;s unique skillset and training make him highly specific and uniquely
qualified to fulfill the work duties and requirements for this job.
Specifically, he is in a quite rare and scarce group with MD and PhD and
fellowship trained in Interventional Radiology at an ACGME-accedited center, as
well as being eligible for certificate of added qualifications in
Interventional Radiology from the American Board of Radiology. He has experience
with drug eluting beads as well as experience with imageable beads for
selective drug delivery and regional drug delivery to the liver. He also has
experience with electromagnetic tracking of surgical instruments and
interventiknal devices, another area of particular interest to the department.
He is the only interventional radiologist in the world who has experience with
micro-CT, and macro-CT and in vivo quantification and imaging of these
iodinated beads, and the only MD PhD with expertise in interventional oncology,
thrombolysis, and imageable beads to our knowledge, available in a timeframe
and frequency conducive to meet our translational research goals. No commercial
or contracting service alternative is available that could provide the
immediate solution and set of skills without extensive on-site training, where
the training of another similar physician without his specific expertise and
skills, could even exceed the length of the contract.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Karun Sharma has become an
authority on the subject of drug eluting beads and imageable beads. He combines
this unique skill with rare expertise in the navigation software and hardware
that were jointly developed by NIH and industry over the past few years. This
skill set combination is also vital and unique for the success of our ongoing
research in this area. As such an expert, he provides these projects with his
experience and background that are not available on the free market and justifies
sole source. No commercial alternative is available and no advertising could
result in her combination of skill sets. He is likewise jointly skilled in large
animal research and large animal catheter manipulation requisite for large
animal research on drugs + devices to be performed. </span></p>

Issued By

NAWC TSD

Background

Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) has a requirement for a Graphical Training Device (GTD) part task trainer, (integrated systems and procedures trainer, or virtual / integrated procedures trainer), to support the TH-57 Intermediate and Advanced Helicopter training syllabus.  The TH-57 is a Bell 206 helicopter that has been modified for helicopter training of US Military pilots.  The target aircraft for the GTD is the D model which has been upgraded to a glass cockpit.  The avionics suite used is the Integrated Avionics System (IAS) consisting of a Chelton Flight Systems synthetic vision EFIS featuring five 4 x 5 Integrated Display Units (IDUs). This 5-screen architecture will include one Primary Flight Display (PFD) and one Multi-Function Display (MFD) installed on the pilots (right side) instrument panel, one PFD and one MFD installed on the copilots (left side) instrument panel, and one dedicated Engine Instruments and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) display installed in the center of the instrument panel. The display units will interface with engine and aircraft system sensors by means of the dual channel Airframe and Engine Data Concentrator (AEDC). The primary interface between the AEDC and the Display Units will be via an ARINC-429 data bus.  The subject training device objective is to familiarize the pilot with all aircraft systems and related instruments, as well as allow for hands on practice to gain experience in the operational functions and procedures of the aircraft systems in all phases of operation.  Also desired is the ability to demonstrate all aircraft systems including related malfunctions and normal and emergency procedures.  It would allow hands-on with switches, knobs, levers, etc. that could reinforce the systems knowledge taught in the classroom portion of the systems course.  The device also requires the ability to enter data through the Primary Flight Display (PFD) and Multi-Function Display (MFD), resulting in the correct display indications and the proper interface with related avionics equipment such as the VHF/UHF Comm.  The training sequence envisioned would have morning systems training (Mediated Interactive Lecture) followed by afternoon GTD sessions Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) to reinforce the systems lessons and to introduce malfunctions and failures of the various systems and recovery options.  The device should be capable of utilizing self-paced lessons that are similar to the capability of higher level computer based training modules.  The functions shall have automated and interactive modes to reinforce the training objectives.  The ability to familiarize the student with system behaviors and functions is the primary objective of this device.  It is not to be confused with higher fidelity Cockpit Procedure Trainers (CPTs) where aircraft procedures are executed and graded, but to teach the systems and what happens within the systems when switches/circuit breakers are manipulated.  This device shall be capable of being configured in a flight mode to step through the actions and reactions of the systems due to airborne emergencies.  Actual cockpit instruments are not required, but accurate graphical depictions should be displayed on touch sensitive (where appropriate) screens.

The following modules will be taught to include components/operating limits/emergency procedures for each:

Electrical (DC/Battery)
Hydraulic
Main Rotor/Transmission
Tail Rotor
Flight Controls
Fuel System
Power Plant and associated systems
Flight Controls/HeliSas (automated flight control stabilization)
Navigation/Avionics (Chelton EFIS, IDU-450, EICAS, Garmin GTX-330 Transponder, COBHAM COM/NAV, COBHAM VHF/UHF)

Below is: Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition

As noted above this is a part that is a matched replacement and upgrade to an existing system.  As such the original vendor must be used to ensure part compatibility with the existing system. Compatible hardware is required both for technical compatibility, and for purposes of accreditation with the Marine Corps Enterprise Network.  Any deviation from the matched system components would require a complete re-engineering of the system, at a significantly greater cost to the government.

<DESC>This is a Federal Supple Schedule requirement in accordance with FAR PART 8.4. Contractors must be on GSA schedule under FSC Group 36, Category: 165-205.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in far subpart 12.6-streamlined procedures for evaluation and solicitation for commercial items-as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. 
This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be ISSUED. 
This is a solicitation for number RMS00090011 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 337215. 
BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: The Series 2000 Lektriever System is essential to and is the only solution to meet the Government's records storage requirements at the Cherokee Agency Title Service Office (TSO). Further market research indicates other companies' similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs. The Cherokee Agency have found that with this electronic filing system, the agency's storage capacity to house the records in TSO's secure filing room can be increased 50% without increasing the size of the facility. The Government would incur substantial unplanned expense by conducting another review and certification process to locate and procure other electronic filing systems that meets the trust records storage requirements. The government would incur substantial cost and risk by using hardware that has not been tested and certified for use within the TSO filing room. Substantial research and testing would have to be done to find another electronic filing system that offers the same capability as Kardex Lektrievers and to ensure same filing capacity with existing storage room. In order for the government to be able to use another brand of electronic filing systems that will increase our storage capacity by 50% or more, the entire filing room would have to be altered in size by knocking an exterior walls and expanding the facilities. The estimate cost was derived based on an analysis of GSA Catalog pricing as compared to past competed filing systems and  current filing systems storage capacities.  These costs justify a brand name only acquisition. 
Only responsible GSA Contractors currently under FSC Group 36, Category: 165-205 who have the ability to provide Series 2000 Letriever System shall provide a quote for the following:
All part numbers are Kardex Series 2000 Letrievers brand name and "or equals" will not be accepted):

Basis for Award

The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter(s) whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoters quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoters technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.

Factor I - Technical Capability 

a. Contract Requirements 

Quotations will be evaluated on the quoters ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to lodging, meeting space, audio visual equipment and technical support, food and beverage service, and secured storage requirements.  Quotations must address the quoters ability to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it relates to lodging and meeting space. Quotations should reflect quality of services provided and maintained.

b. Location 

Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility located within the specified postal zip codes with adequate parking for participants and presenters. 

c. Availability of Dates 

Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to those quoters who can provide the services on the dates in the order indicated. The Government will not consider alternate dates.

Factor II - Past Performance 

The quoter must provide references for at least three (3) federal government contracts for similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The quoter will be evaluated based on customer satisfaction and timeliness. The contact information for each reference shall include the following: 

Contract type
Contract number
Contract/Task value
Agency/Company Name
Agency/Company point of contact telephone number
Duration of task/contract
Type of services provided (brief description)
List any problems encountered on each contract and the contractors corrective actions

EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of timely deliveries and customer service on similar requirements. NOTE: In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase quoters overall rating nor decrease it

Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities portion of the technical evaluation factors.

Factor III  Price
The price quotation will be evaluated against the independent Government Cost Estimate.

Notice: The Government reserves the right to make contract award without discussion with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, quoters must submit their most favorable terms from a technical standpoint. In addition to the above, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The contractor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Item with your quote. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Item and Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order-Commercial Items are incorporated by reference.

*****PLEASE NOTE******
THIS CONTRACT REQUIRES (1) 1100 cube VAN



Enclosed please find the formal solicitation package you requested.  The Postal Service has determined that Highway Contract Route (HCR) transportation services will no longer be advertised to the public as an Invitation to Bid.  Accordingly, this solicitation is being offered to the public as a Request for Proposal.  There are significant changes in this process.  Some of these changes are as follows:

1.	As stated under Clause 2.2.8 in the Terms and Conditions, the Postal Service has implemented a program under which postal highway contract route (HCR) suppliers will obtain fuel at certain designated wholesale fuel servicing facilities and retail fuel servicing facilities; all suppliers are required to participate in the Fuel Management Program (see the Fuel Management Program document enclosed dated February 11, 2009).  For evaluation purposes, the contract baseline fuel price per gallon will be determined by the Contracting Officer based on the fueling locations provided by the HCR supplier on the enclosed Fuel Purchase Form (HC 131).  The contracting officer will use the average quarterly Department of Energy Regional Fuel Index cost per gallon on the solicitation closing date to evaluate proposals (based on the Fuel Purchase Form submitted).   For bulk fuel purchases, the quarterly average USPS Bulk Fuel Program Price Per Gallon will be used for proposal evaluation.  Therefore, for line 6 (fuel) on Form 7468A, Highway Transportation Contract  Bid or Renewal Worksheet, the supplier should include the number of gallons only; the cost per gallon and total cost should be set to zero ($0.00).

2.	All parties submitting a proposal will continue to receive a formal notification of contract award.  The notification will identify the successful vendor and price.
	
3.	Under Clause 2.1, as stated in the Terms and Conditions, this is a Fixed rate contract for highway transportation service to be provided according to the Statement of work and Specifications indicated in the solicitation, schedule, and special notes. The basis for payment established for this contract is stated in the solicitation.  No adjustments will be made in contract price except as provided under other clauses of this contract.
	
4.	The solicitation may require a supplier to submit with their proposal information that was not previously requested in advance of the closing date.  The vendor must carefully review Section 3.1.2 of the HCR Terms and Conditions (April 27, 2009) for Information to be provided.  
5.	Section 2.3.3.b, Termination for the Postal Services Convenience is incorporated in this contract; Section 2.3.3.a of the terms and conditions, Termination with Notice, does not apply.

The Postal Service reserves the right to award this solicited service with or without discussions.


Once the contract has been awarded, adjustments to the bottom line can be made only in accordance with Management Instructions on Economic Adjustments. If you do not understand the adjustment process, contact the office that published the solicitation for an explanation prior to preparing your offer.

<p>All jobs will be accomplished as follows:</p>
<p>1. Prior to painting, the surfaces of the vehicles and equipment to be painted shall be prepared by sanding/blasting. All paint edges shall be feather-edged to give a smooth appearance. Additionally, all loose paint and rust shall be completely removed. All reflectors and license plates will be removed before painting of all vehicles. If reflectors are damaged, new ones will be provided by the 606 Air Control Squadron. All rubber hoses shall also be masked off prior to painting. All outer wheels will also be painted with appropriate camouflage pattern.</p>
<p>2. All 5-ton trucks and water buffalos will be spray painted in the woodland camouflage pattern using MIL-DTL-64159 CARC paint IAW TO 36-1-161 and 36-1-171 application instructions. The bed of the 5-ton truck shall be painted solid green with no camouflage pattern. All paint and material will be provided by the contractor in sufficient quantities. Close attention shall be paid to interior of all 5 ton trucks in the lower window sill area. If this area has any corrosion, it shall be removed by sandblasting or sanding and repainted with similar color of interior. Paint will also cease to the interior door jam. Another problem area to pay attention to is the hood of the cab. If any part of this hood is corroded it will be repaired and reinforced back to original specifications.</p>

<p>4. A Joint Inspection of all vehicles to be painted will be conducted between the contractor and LGPV. During this inspection, the contractor will point out all items (fenders, bumpers, panels ect.) that they deem non-repairable and recommend for replacement. Once both parties agree on the items for replacement, Vehicle Maintenance (LGPV) will replace those items prior to the vehicle being picked up by the contractor.</p>
<p>5. Quality of finished product will be consistent with standard commercial paint work (i.e. free of runs, even in color, dirt, and dust-free).</p>
<p>6. Prior to return, the vehicles and equipment will be completely demasked, cleaned of dust and foreign matter. The vehicles and equipment will be inspected by 606 ACS/LGPV after completion of service.</p>
<p>7. The contractor will be responsible for cost reimbursement to the government for any damage to the equipment caused by the contractor. This includes any parts and labor costs associated with required repairs.</p>
<p>8. The contractor will be provided with&nbsp;4 vehicles and/or equipment monthly. The vehicles and equipment shall be completely repainted and turned back over to 606 ACS/LGPV personnel not later than 21 work days after receipt of the unit.</p>
<p>9. 606 ACS/LGPV will send a technician to the contractor if an equipment item breaks down, begins to leak, or to provide technical assistance about painting the vehicles or equipment.</p>
<p>10. The contractor shall ensure English-speaking personnel are available for any communications between the contractor and vehicle maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>11. 606 ACS/LGPV personnel will&nbsp;transport vehicles and equipment back and forth between Spangdahlem Air Base and the contractor's facility.</strong></p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>&nbsp; After reviewing input from industry and with coordination from the Small Business office at OO-ALC, the acquisition team has decided to change the business approach for supporting this VSR requirement.</p>
<p>For the KC-135 portion of the requirement, the Pre-solicitation Notice under FA8223-10-R-135TS will be amended to expand its' scope and include the VSR upgrade which will be Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) as a modification task, representative of the kinds of changes that will be accomplished under the KC-135 ATS program in out-years but which cannot be defined and priced at this time. Note that part but not all VSR required funding will be available at the outset, and some applicable line items will be described as options. Draft documentation in the KC-135 notice will be amended in the next few weeks to address functional requirements, specifications, and schedules and to detail additional evaluation criteria which will apply. An opportunity for a technical conference at McConnell AFB the week of 15 Jun 09 will also be provided.&nbsp; The Air Force intends to promote a fair and open competitive procedure for this mod task to be accomplished within the context of the KC-135 ATS solicitation. Opportunities for small business participation will also be promoted. See the special provision for enhanced small business participation in the draft KC-135 ATS documentation.</p>
<p><br />For the KC-10 portion of the VSR requirement, it is our business decision to execute the requirement by means of an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) which will be solicited within the scope of the existing KC-10 ATS support contract (F33657-01-D-2078-QP02) under the Authority of FAR 52.243-1, the Changes clause. Similarly, by means of specific instructions in the change proposal solicitation, the Air Force will promote a fair and open competitive procedure by the incumbent prime integrator by requiring that multiple design solutions will be evaluated. Opportunities for small business participation will also be promoted.</p>
<p>This VSR Notice is hereby cancelled.</p>

<DESC><p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is planning to release the ATHENA Program Broad Agency Announcement (IARPA-BAA-09-03) in late June 2009.  This program is classified at the TOP SECRET/ Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) level. In anticipation of this release, all potential bidders are required to provide a response to this notice so that IARPA can establish temporary Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) Co-use Agreements.  This temporary co-use will allow potential bidders the ability to receive and prepare responses to this BAA, and will remain in effect throughout the pre-award phase of the program.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: For this program, companies without an existing SCIF will be unable to receive the BAA. Those companies without approved SCIF facilities who are interested in performing on this program may wish to explore teaming options with companies that have existing SCIFs, classified storage, and classified information systems. Based on information provided by the potential bidder, IARPA will make all reasonable attempts to have co-use agreements established; however, the Government cannot guarantee a co-use can be established for each SCIF. Hence, early submission of information will provide the best potential for successful co-use processing. A future announcement regarding availability of the BAA will be sent directly to those vendors who have received co-use agreement approval. IARPA will contact the Primary Point of Contact to announce BAA availability using the unclassified e-mail address provided.</p>
<p>Interested potential bidders are required to provide the following information to assist in the establishment of the requisite co-use agreement:</p>
<p>Company Name:<br />SCIF Address:<br />SCIF Room Number(s):<br />SCIF Sponsor:<br />SCIF ID Number:<br />Facility Waivers (if yes, list waivers):<br />Level of Facility Accreditation (TS/SI required):<br />Level of Classified Storage (TS/SI required):<br />Open/Close Storage:<br />Level of Information Systems (IS) Processing?<br />Courier System Utilized:<br />Courier Address:<br />Security Officer Name(s):<br />Security Officer Contact Information (unclassified and classified e-mail/phone):<br />Primary Point of Contact (unclassified and classified e-mail/phone):</p>
<p>All responses should be directed, via secure channels, to schalot@dni.ic.gov. Responses should be sent as soon as possible, but must be received no later than 5:00EST, 29 May 2009. Those potential bidders planning to utilize multiple SCIFs must provide the above information for each facility.</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) announces the upcoming release of a solicitation entitled Human Genetic Cell Repository.
  
The proposed project is a continuation of the Human Genetic Cell Repository funded by the contract HHS-N-260-2005-00001-C.  The Human Genetic Cell Repository is a unique resource designed to provide investigators with cell lines from patients with a wide variety of genetic disorders and from normal individuals, as well as other cell lines useful for genetic studies.  The Repository also prepares and distributes DNA derived from selected cell lines.  To provide these cell lines and DNA samples, the Repository acquires appropriate cell samples, establishes cell lines from them, characterizes and stores the cell lines, extracts and stores DNA samples from cell lines, maintains a comprehensive computerized database, advertises the availability of the cell lines and DNA samples, and distributes them to investigators upon request.  During the next contract period the Repository will continue to perform essentially the same tasks but will increase its efforts in the establishment, maintenance, and distribution of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and differentiated cells, and will offer certain services related to providing cell cultures and DNA samples.

It is anticipated that a five-year cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded, with an expected award date on or before January 1, 2010. 

All responsible, qualified entities are invited to submit a proposal to be considered by the Government. The estimated release date of solicitation number NIHGM2009001 is 15 days after issuance of this synopsis and will be posted on www.fbo.gov.  Offerors are responsible for routinely checking this website for any solicitation amendments that may be issued.  Proposals will be due 30 days after issuance of the solicitation.

RELEASE OF TECHNICAL DATA PACKAGE INFORMATION:  This program includes information that has been designated a Distribution D and is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  In addition, the program requires a procurement effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms.  Some documents are under Federal export control for sensitive or controlled technologies regulated by the U.S. Department of States International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) protecting national security.  Data may not be exported without an approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.  As such, the documents contain data whose export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law and dissemination to non-U.S. persons whether in the United States or abroad requires an export license or other authorization.  Disclosure of the control drawings requires the verification of a current license for the oral, visual or documentary disclose of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons as defined under the U.S. Department of State website, http://pmdtc.org/licenses.htm.

To participate in this program, all firms must acknowledge their responsibility under the Arms Export Control Act.  A foreign firm may be required to team with a U.S. firm that possesses a current and valid U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities, inclusive of the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program.  Any resultant contractor teaming or license agreements between U.S. firms and foreign firms, to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S. firms, shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy and shall require the prior approval of the contracting officer and foreign disclosure officer.  It is the contractors responsibility to provide evidence of any such agreement and/or license to this office for review and this shall be verified prior to release of any controlled documents.  

Prior to release of any control document under this solicitation, the contractor must acknowledge its responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations (including the obligation, under certain circumstances, to obtain an export license prior to the release of technical data within or outside the United States) and agree that it will not disseminate any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide this certification and/or proof of a current approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.  Upon verification of your status and acknowledgement, the requested documents will be provided.

As such, some attachments associated with the solicitation may not be posted with the draft RFP and must be obtained through this office.

In addition, the written request must include acknowledgement of the contractors responsibility under the U.S. export contract laws and regulations.

<DESC>The Robust Surface Navigation (RSN) program seeks to develop technology for geospatial location and navigation using signals of opportunity (SoOP).  These SoOPs are primarily envisioned to be man-made radio emitters not originally intended for location and navigation (such as commercial communications satellites, commercial radio and television broadcast towers, or mobile telephone towers), but may be extended to active beacons purposefully deployed in a tactical military situation.  The RSN program is intended to counter localized jamming or global failure of the Global Positioning System (GPS) due to enemy actions, and to complement GPS capabilities in situations for which it was not intended, for example, inside buildings, in dense urban environments, and under dense foliage. Phase 1 of RSN presented analyses that showed the expected positioning performance using SoOPs and beacons in various environments, including open-sky line of sight, urban canyons of varying density, inside buildings of varying complexity, and under dense foliage.  The objective of RSN Phase 2 is to develop and demonstrate a functional prototype of the RSN system.  The RSN system must solve the fundamental problem of navigation and geolocation in GPS-denied areas, especially in difficult environments of inside buildings and in urban canyons.

<DESC>Sierra has three potable water wells; these wells exceed the allowable levels for manganese, iron, and uranium. The State of California has demanded that corrective action be taken. This design-build project is intended to provide treatment facilities at two of the three wells to eliminate the contaminant load (the third well, 9, will be pumped to the nearest well, 5, and be treated there due to real estate constraints).  Design will be required to transport wastewater generated by the treatment methodology, to a disposable area on the north area of the post.  Further, all building interior elements of building 92, which houses limited telemetry on the existing system, shall be removed to provide sufficient space for all the new control equipment and electronic record-keeping equipment to monitor the system.
