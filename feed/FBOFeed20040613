A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.  THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSUED TO CORRECT THE DUE DATE OF RECEIPT OF CAPABILITY AND INTEREST STATEMENT TO READ JUNE 22, 2004 IN LIEU OF JUNE 29, 2004.
