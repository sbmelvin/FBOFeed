SEWRPC with its history of producing digital imagery, desires to become a long term partner for this data.  It is in the interest of USGS and the Homeland Security program to continue working with SEWRPC.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  NO FORMAL RFQ WILL BE AVAILABLE.  The anticipated award date is 07/16/2005, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13.5.  The NAICS code is 925120.  FSC (P&S) Code is 7644.

<DESC>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a sole source commercial purchase order to Agilent Technologies, Inc.  The requirement is to replace the eleven [11] year old LC/GC/Mass Spectrometer for the Chemistry Department at USAFA CO.  The Department of Chemistry has an important need for an ESI/MALDI LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System to meet the requirements of large molecule inorganics or organometalics, nonvolatile molecules and protein/peptide analysis in advanced chemistry courses and work being done in the chemistry research center.  Time-of-flight mass spectrometry [TOF MS] was developed in the last 1940’s, but until the 1990’s, its popularity was limited.  Recent improvements in TOF technology, including orthogonal acceleration, ion mirrors [reflections], and high-speed electronics, have significantly improved TOF resolution.  This improved resolution, combined with powerful and easy-to-use electrospray [ESI] and matrix-assister laser desorption ionization [MALDI] ion sources, have made TOF MS a core technology for the analysis of both small and large molecules.  Most of the introductory organic or analytical chemistry courses work with volatile organic compounds that can easily be analyzed on Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometers [GCMS.  As chemistry courses advance into courses such as Biochemistry, Macro Biochemistry and Materials Science studies larger and more complex molecules are studied.  To work with these large molecules, a new type of sample introduction process is needed to transfer, separate and inject Liquid Chromatography [LC] into a mass spectrometer [TOF MS].  As well as being an extremely sensitive detection system [TOF MS] can separate large proteins and peptides, like RNA and DNA for example.  The purpose for this sole source acquisition is to provide a more “user friendly”, easy to maintain, and highly technological ESI/MALDI LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System that is capable of meeting the needs of the USAFA Chemistry Department, departmental teaching criteria and student ease of use requirements.  The Agilent Technologies model 1100 series ESI/MALDI/ LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System is the only brand name/sole source that can satisfy the government’s requirements.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  “See Note 22”.

<DESC>Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a firm fixed price contract for 1,176 commercial body armor vests, 2,352 soft ballistic panel inserts, and 2,352 ceramic hard armor inserts to KDH Defense Systems, Inc., 239 Main Street, Suite 240, Johnstown, PA 15901. These body armor vests manufactured by KDH have been determined to be the only vests capable of meeting the functionality and specific mission requirements, including wear-ability, flexibility, a quick-release mechanism so that the armor can be jettisoned from the wearer to reduce the potential for drowning, and certified protection against NIJ 0101.04 Level III threats and 7.62mm x 39mm API threats. KDH vests have the following characteristics which fulfill these requirement: Quick-Release Mechanism utilizes a single wire for simplicity in activation; Quick-Release Mechanism single wire allows for efficient reassembly; Quick-Release Mechanism can be re-assembled within 75 seconds or less; Quick-Release!  Mechanism is also utilized for fit adjustment; all moving parts of the Quick-Release are centrally located in the front panel; Quick-Release Mechanism has no exposed parts with the exception of the handle; and upon release of the Quick-Release the vest remains in no more than two sections. The hard armor ceramic plates offered by this vendor provide certified protection against NIJ 0101.04 Level III threats, military threats as specified for the Interceptor SAPI plates, and also the 7.62mm x 39mm API threats recently experienced in the combat theater. No other supplier provides this same protection in its ceramic plates. Ceramic plates are required for their reduced weight, which is also a requirement as a result of the specific mission environment. Further, the Berry Amendment, 10 U.S.C. 2533a, as implemented at DFARS 225.7002-1, prohibits the Department of Defense from expending funds for foreign fabrics, including synthetic fabrics. The vendor is also capable of meeting ! an accelerated delivery schedule, to begin delivery 30 days after contract award, and make final delivery no later than 14 weeks after award. See Note 22.

<DESC>This procurement is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposers whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone Small Business concerns, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4.  AWARD MAY BE MADE TO A FIRM OTHER THAN THAT SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICE.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED.  THEREFORE OFFERORS INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERMS.  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction and repair by design-build or design-bid-build of roofing systems at various locations within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility, including but not limited to:  Arizona, California, and Nevada.  However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California.  The type of work/projects may include, but is not limited to: new installation, addition, alterations, maintenance, and repair of various roofing systems such as, but not limited to, single ply, modified bitumen, shingle, preformed metal, foam and built-up roofing systems.  It also covers all roofing related work such as, but not limited to, demolition and disposal of roofing materials that may contain asbestos and lead paint, removal and reinstallation of equipment, piping and HVAC ductwork, carpentry work, painting and installation of gutters, downspouts, fascia, vents and drainage assemblies.  The North American Industry Code Standard is 238160 and the annual size standard is $12 million.  In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (Architect-Engineer) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract.  In an effort to avoid a potential conflict of interest, Offerors are encouraged to offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.      After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months.  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. For each contract, the estimated maximum dollar value over the base year and all four option periods combined is $25,000,000.  Task orders will range between $2,000 and $1,000,000.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $25,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  Factor 1 - Past Performance of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 2 – Support of Small Business; Factor 3 - Experience of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 4 – Technical Approach; and Factor 5 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  The recommended subcontracting goals for the contract value (base and all options periods) are as follows: 5% - Woman-Owned Small Business; 5% - Small Disadvantaged Business; 3% - HUBZone Small Business; 3% - Veteran-Owned Small Business; 3% - Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; - and 50% Other Small Business.  Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  Proposed Task Order (PTO) 0001 includes all labor, materials and equipment necessary for removal and replacement of the existing metal roofing system of Hangar No. 1 and incidental related work at Marine Corps Base, San Diego, CA.  The project will also include disposal of the existing roofing material, corrective repairs, weatherproofing, metal deck pitch roof replaced with standing seam insulated roof, hazardous material removal and disposal, and incorporating sustainable design features.  The Hangar will remain in operation during the entire construction period.  The Contractor shall conduct his operations so as to cause the least possible interference with normal operations of the activity.  This PTO is representative of the type of work that may be procured through this contract not necessarily the value.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for the fabrication of ten (10) carbon phenolic material billets, which will be evaluated for use as a heat shield for planetary probes, or, potentially, as thermal shielding for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV). NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Reinhold Industries, Inc. of Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), only one source reasonably available.  The contractor has the unique capability necessary to manufacture chopped molded carbon phenolic materials using required heritage (flight-certified) processes.  Selection of an alternate vendor would require re-qualification of their process, which would entail additional quality, budget and schedule risks for the Government. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local (Pacific) time on July 20, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the Characterization of Total Noise vs. Temperature Stability for JWST NIRSpec Sensor Chip Assembly. Statement of Work is attached. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from the University of Hawaii, for the following reason(s): The James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Spectrograph Detector Subsystem has a requirement on temperature stability on the focal plane array (FPA) of 20 mK (TBR) per 1008 seconds integration (Req. 10.2.4.2.1; JWST-RQMT-003115). This requirement is in turn driven by a 6 electrons rms per 1008 seconds integration total noise requirement (Req. 2.7.1.2; ESA-JWST-RQ-22).  To resolve the TBR on Req. 10.2.4.2.1, we plan to undertake ultra-low background testing in a laboratory that has the following capabilities: (1) experience testing Rockwell's JWST detectors and (2) established capability of meeting Req. 2.7.1.2. As of today, only the University of Hawaii has experience testing 5 micron JWST sensor chip assemblies and an established ability to meet the challenging 6 electrons rms total noise requirement. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 21, 2005.

The breakout of items required is below: 162 BU-65553M2-612 1   One Lot Date Code 4   BU-65570M1-300 4   BU-69404DS-64VM NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Data Device Corporation (DDC) which currently manufactured the original units to enable an upgrade path which avoids any impacts to any of the users of the old 1553 cards.  Units will be distributed to developers and to replace flight units as per current usage with the old units.  DDC built the original flight cards and is the only manufacturers whose card has been certified by NASA for the Space Station Program.   DDC implementation allows NASA to utilize this card with minimal or no	impact to the PCS Command and Control software that utilizes this 1553 card and driver.  The existing 1553 card and its replacement identified in this procurement can utilize the same 1553 driver and allows for the use of the new card with no new code development.  The new 1553 card with its expanded memory also allows the PCS software to utilize the existing memory space established by the predecessor card with no impact to software code. DDC is providing detailed manufacturing and testing information to support NASA’s certification of this card.  This significantly reduces the need to repeat certain identified tests that were performed previously by the manufacturer as part of their internal certification.   DDC is producing a unique lot of 1553 cards for this procurement as well as a	unique part number assigned only for NASA.  Additionally, DDC will be stamping all part numbers, serial numbers, and date code information on a single side of a 1553 card reducing the need for an identifying label.	This is being done to support all flammability requirements and testing required by NASA. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 15, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>B--Development of Statistically Based Quantitative Structure-Toxicity Relationship (QSTR) Models for Predicting the Sub-Chronic Toxicity Benchmarks for a Variety of Chemicals
<SOLNBR>PR-CI-05-10965
<CONTACT>LYNNE W. LEWIS, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: (513) 487-2040, E-Mail: Lewis.Lynne@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.EPA), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC), seeks a contractor to use the experimental sub-chronic toxicity benchmark (in the form of a LOAEL, BMD, or BMDL10) data to develop predictive models to estimate the sub-chronic toxicity of a variety of chemicals through the use of Quantitative Structure-Toxicity Relationships (QSTRs).  The contractor shall develop a separate QSTR model for each of the above-mentioned benchmarks.  QSTRs are mathematical equations that describe correlations between various descriptors of molecular structures of chemicals and their observed biological activities.  The resulting mathematical equations can then be used to calculate the biological activities of new chemicals or other chemicals that lack experimental toxicity data.  The descriptors should be able to quantify the transport, bulk and electronic attributes of a molecular structure that are responsible for the observed biological activity. In this research, NHSRC will provide the contractor with the sub-chronic toxicity benchmark data, including toxic endpoints, and relevant experimental citations for approximately 200 to 500 chemicals.  The contractor shall calculate descriptors for these chemicals using common descriptor generator programs similar to Computer Aided Chemistry (CAChe), Codessa, Molconn-Z, Dragon, and other commercial or non-commercial descriptor generator tools.  The contractor shall reveal the source and the details for both the commercial and non-commercial descriptor generator tools,  and provide NHSRC details on obtaining the software such that NHSRC can duplicate some of the work.  Such descriptor generator tools should be capable of generating descriptors using both 2D and 3D structures. Each proposed QSTR should be a statistically robust model that can 1) predict the sub-chronic toxicity benchmarks for a variety of chemicals that lack experimental toxicity data, 2) recognize the varying toxic effects of isomers, and 3) incorporate mode and mechanism of action if these data are available and provided by NHSRC.  In addition to developing the QSTR models, the contractor shall test the predictive ability of the model by using at least 10 percent of the database chemicals as test chemicals.  The contractor shall also group the final QSTRs into sub-models based on chemical classification and test these sub-models for their predictive ability. The proposed contract will have period of performance of 13 months.  It is anticipated that a firm-fixed contract will result from this solicitation. The current projected start date of the contract is February 1, 2005.  The applicable NAICS code is 541990 with a size standard of $6 Million.  The solicitation will appear on the Internet under Solicitation Number PR-CI-05-10965.  It may be accessed through the EPA?s home page on the World Wide Web (www.epa.gov). The direct link URL is  http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  All responsible sources who submit a proposal will be considered by the Agency.  It is the responsibility of offerors to check FedBizOpps or the EPA website address for updates or changes.  It is anticipated that this RFP will be available after August 10, 2005.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks to award professional services on a sole source basis to the University of Wisconsin based on the following circumstances outlined below that only one source is available.  This requirement is to provide professional services for the project titled, "Assessment of Distribution of Prions During Wastewater Treatment".  This project is a follow-on to 2004 US EPA's Region 8 RARE research project, "Prion Fate in Wastewater Systems".  The data generated will be used to 1)  enhance the understanding of the fate and persistence of prions in wastewater treatment systems, 2) aid in the development of best management practices for handling and disposing of prion-contaminated waste; and 3) help guide the selection and promulgation of US EPA regulations concerning the  discharge of prion-contaminated wastewater in primarily publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) and septic systems.   The U.S. EPA-Office of Research and Development, National Risk Management Research Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio is only aware of one source that is available for this project.  The  University of Wisconsin is the only source that is capable of conducting this research on the fate and transports of prions in wastewater treatment systems.  It is the only research institute in the United States with facilities having an acceptable safety protocol for conducting engineering  studies using prions.  The University has ongoing work to develop the analytical methodologies for detecting prions in the environment outside of infected animal tissue and have synthesized the only labeled prions in wastewater systems for the past year under the guidelines of the 2004 US EPA  Region 8 RARE research project.  As a result of the above, the University of Wisconsin is the only acceptable source that can provide the required services for this requirement.  Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to perform the services described above, should provide a  capabilities statement demonstrating how their qualifications, experience, and ability to provide a greater understanding of prions in wastewater treatment systems.  A statement of work and any other applicable documents will be made available upon request.  The information received in response to  this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please send your documentation to Angela Schopler at the office identified above, by fax (513)487-2109 or by e-mail at schopler.angela@epa.gov which establishes that their  specifications or qualifications meet the EPA's requirement.  Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.  No phone requests will be honored.  A determination by the EPA not to compete this proposed contract  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a purchase order, using FAR Part 13 procedures,  for ME Receptor Model Development for Rotational Control.  The purpose of the order is to develop a stand-alone executable of ME-2 that builds upon the previously developed executables and incorporates source profile and/or contribution constraints.  These versions of the program will be registered to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the EPA will be able to freely distribute the programs at no cost to the users.  Inputs to the  executable will include sample concentrations, sample uncertainties, supplementary data (factors such as weekend/weekday), and profile/contribution constraints expressed through direct rotational control, targets and tolerances, or physically-relevant properties.  Outputs from the executable will  include model diagnostics, source profiles, sample source contribution estimates, factor coefficients, and measures of whether the data support the profile/contribution constraints.  In addition, the executable shall provide estimates of uncertainties in these model outputs.  Period of performance  is expected to be one year from award of the purchase order.  A Request for Quotations (RFQ) with complete information will be posted in approximately 15 days on the EPA's website at the following address:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/   Hard copies of the RFQ will not be available.  Offerors  should note the Quality requirements of this procurement.  As part of their quotation, offerors must provide a description of their organization's quality system and a brief quality assurance project plan consistent with G-5M or the "Review Criteria for Category 4 Modeling QAPP."  The EPA's G-5M  document is posted at the following web address:  http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/g5m-final.pdf   A copy of the Category 4 document is posted on the EPA web site along with the RFQ.  Offerors must submit both a technical proposal and a price proposal.  The technical proposal must include  responses to the Technical Evaluation Criteria posted with the RFQ, as well as the required Quality documentation.  In determining the best value for the government, responses to the Technical Evaluation Criteria are considered significantly more important than price.  The cost proposal must show  costs broken out for each Task.  Additionally, the quotation must stipulate that the EPA will be allowed to distribute all executables developed under the procurement at no charge.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments (if any) will be distributed solely through the  EPA's web site.

Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV missile is required to perform this effort, RSC is the only source capable of performing the tasks necessary to upgrade the GTS with the new GEU-R and AGR4 in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Experimental Immunology Branch (EIB) plans to enter into a sole source procurement for LAS-3000 Multi-Functional Camera System from Fuji Film Medical Systems U.S.A., Inc., 419 West Ave, Stamford, CT 06902.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.    The EIB performs basic research in the functioning and interaction of immune cells and how they relate to oncogenesisis and cancer progression.  Many of these studies require very precise measurements of metabolic compounds.  The Fuji LAS-3000 is a true 16-bit camera and super Charge Coupled Device (CCD) technology providing for an ultra-high resolution equivalent of 6.3 million pixels and a 4 order of magnitude dynamic range, with the enhanced sensitivity of an f0.85 lens, which reduces exposure time and increases sensitivity to very low light conditions.  The camera system the EIB requires for its experiments must:  1) provide superior dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude; 2) have high resolution image equivalent exceeding 4 M pixels; and 3) have faint light capturing ability of a f0.85 lens to detect molecules at very low concentrations.  This increased sensitivity and linearity is necessary to document very small changes in expression of the molecules being studied. 
Fuji Film Medical Systems U.S.A., Inc. is the only source known to the NCI researcher that has a camera system that provides the aforementioned unique features that are required for their research. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT, on July 13, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the services of a contractor to  convene an expert panel of vocational and occupational medical experts and disability policy and program experts for a study that will review the value and efficiency of using vocational experts at various levels of the disability determination process currently used by SSA to determine eligibility for the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability programs.  The purpose of this study is to enhance the expertise needed in disability decision making related to functional limitations of a claimant’s ability to perform jobs available in the national economy.  The contractor will direct and oversee the project and work with panel members, as necessary, to develop the required research and policy papers on which the expert panel will deliberate.  The contractor will convene an expert panel to 1) assess the current use of vocational and occupational medical expertise throughout SSA’s disability determination process; 2) determine how to provide needed vocational and occupational medical expertise at all levels of the disability determination process to improve the quality of case adjudication; 3) determine how the needed expertise should be provided – specifically, should SSA create a national or regional cadre which would be available to all disability adjudicators?; and 4) determine what qualifications candidates should have to provide vocational and occupational medical expertise.  SSA anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price (with reimbursable travel) contract with a period of performance of 27 weeks from the date of award.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720, with a size standard of $6.0 million.  Solicitation number SSA-RFP-05-1037, is scheduled for release on or about May 6, 2005, with proposals due 30 calendar days thereafter.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE MAILED.  Telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders list will be maintained.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the FedBizOpps website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments that may be issued.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  All questions must be submitted via email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command intends to solicit a proposal for research and development services in the area of improved grids for lead-acid batteries.  These vehicle battery grids will extend battery life, especially for batteries used in deep cycle applications by preventing corrosion of the battery grids when operated under extreme conditions required by the military.  The Army's vision is to greatly reduce costs by reducing the frequency of replacing batteries in ve hicles, such as the HMMWV and other types of equipment, such as communications equipment, generators, and other support-type equipment.  It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded to Firefly Energy, Inc. of Peoria, IL without competition.  The contract may have follow-on opportunities.  A cost reimbursement contract is anticipated.  The estimated release date of the solicitation is 2 2 July 2005, closing on 29 August 2005.

<DESC>Provide marine debris collection and removal from Unalaska Island and Vicinity Aleutian Islands, Alaska during August and/or September 2005

BACKGROUND
Marine debris poses a serious threat to marine biota. Small plastic particles may be ingested by marine organism, causing deleterious effects. Larger marine debris items such as fishing nets, ropes, and plastic packaging kill thousands of birds and mammal each year, mostly by entanglement. Cleaning up marine debris reduces its impact on marine biota, and makes a significant aesthetic contribution to the affected shoreline.

During December, 2004, the M/V Selendang Ayu grounded on the west side of Unalaska Island releasing over 400,000 gallons of a heavy fuel oil, much of which made its way to the island’s shorelines. As part of the response to this oil spill, scientists from NOAA Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R) and representatives from other agencies are conducting a detailed survey of the location and characteristics of the oil on the shoreline. This survey will cover over 750 km of shorelines. Marine debris, prevalent in the area, is expected to be encountered. Concentrations of marine debris will be photographed, described, and their exact location surveyed by GPS. Thus, an extensive and expensive survey conducted for the purpose of characterizing the oil spill will also serve to collect data on location of marine debris, and the data be used to collect marine debris from affected shorelines.

2.	OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this statement of work (SOW) are:

2.1	Collect marine debris identified in the Selendeng Ayu surveyed shoreline data, in pre-designated areas in the vicinity of Unalaska and adjacent Islands. Load the debris on a landing craft (or similar vessel(s)) and transport the marine debris from the contaminated sites to a collection area;

2.2	Segregate marine debris items into useable, recyclable items such as floats, and unusable, non-recyclable items which need to be disposed of;

2.3	Dispose of the marine debris appropriately and legally either locally or off-island.

The Contractor must perform all work required to meet the objectives and complete the tasks as described in this SOW, including but not limited to mobilizing personnel, equipment and materials necessary to complete all tasks exercised.

The Contractor must ensure that all work is conducted in an environmentally sound manner and conforms to the applicable laws and regulations promulgated by the Federal Government, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the US Coast Guard, the State of Alaska, and local government entities.

3. 	GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION
In general, the area targeted for this round of marine debris collection is in the greater vicinity of Unalaska Island, Alaska. Specifically, the areas are along the north side of Akutan Island, the north side of Unalaska Island, and the east-facing shoreline of Umnak Island. 

4.	SPECIFIC TASKS
The Contractor must provide all labor, management, supervision, tools and equipment, materials, transportation, lodging, meals, and administrative supplies necessary to perform the tasks of this SOW. 

4.1	Task 1: Marine Debris Collection
The contractor shall transport personnel and equipment to specific locations identified by earlier surveys, and as directed by NOAA. Contractor personnel will collect marine debris in these locations and load it on the landing craft (or similar vessels). Marine debris may be collected by hand, tools, and/or with the aid of mechanized means such as ATV with trailer or small backhoe/front loader. The contractor must ensure that the marine debris collected is not contaminated with oil. 

4.2	Task 2. Marine Debris Transport
The contractor will transport the marine debris to a central location for disposal. The contractor shall utilize vessels and equipment in an optimal way to maximize efficiency and reduce unnecessary costs. 

4.3	Task 3: Marine Debris Offloading and Disposal
The contractor will offload the marine debris at a central collection point, and, if possible, segregate the debris into (1) usable and recyclable items such as floats in good condition, and (2) unusable debris that shall be disposed of. The contractor will dispose of unusable marine debris locally, if possible. If local disposal is not possible, the contractor will make arrangements to dispose of the marine debris at a landfill off-island. The contractor will seek necessary approvals and permits to dispose of the marine debris, and, if necessary, make arrangements for off-island disposal. 

5.	SCOPE OF WORK
This marine debris cleanup project is expected to involve the following:

•	Three laborers plus manual tools for seven days to load, transport, and unload debris;
•	A landing craft (or similar vessel) including landing craft operators for seven days to load and transport debris;
•	One skiff + operator to for seven days;
•	One ATV + ATV trailer for seven days to haul debris;
•	One backhoe/front loader (or similar) for 7 days to load/unload debris.

Work Days and Weather Days
The contractor will perform no less than seven (7) full work days executing the task orders of this SOW. The contract will include a contingency for bad weather which may halt operations, for a total time not to exceed three (3) days. 
This is a simplified acquisition that is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.

This is a combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.       This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     The solicitation number is HSCEAM-05-R-00030, which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).     This requirement is a small business set-aside.     The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.


The proposed ranges must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:

       As set forth in the section entitled, ?Location and Schedule Requirements,? the range must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the time indicated.     

       The range may be indoors or outdoors and shall possess a minimum of ten (10) firing points with compressor and small generator.     An indoor range shall possess air conditioning, heating, and approved ventilation system in conformance with existing OSHA standards.

       The range shall be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards. There shall be firing lines at the 1.5, 3, 7, 15 and 25 yard lines.

       The range shall possess moveable barricades for the 15 and 25-yard line course of fire.     The barricades shall be constructed of a material that does not deflect or ricochet rounds that inadvertently strike it. (Example: wood).     FOR OUTDOOR RANGES THE BERMS MUST BE OF SUFFICIENT DEPTH SO THAT ROUNDS CASNNOT PENETRATE OR "SHOOT THROUGH" THE BERM.     THE BERMS MUST BE OF SUFFICIENT HEIGHT TO PREVENT ROUNDS FROM EXITING THE RANGE DURING NORMAL COURSE OF FIRE.     THE BERMS SHALL BE MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE A SAFE SHOOTING ENVIRONMENT AT ALL TIMES WHEN UTILIZED BY DHS PERSONNEL.     FOR INDOOR RANGES THE BACKSTOP/BULLET TRAO MUST BE MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE A SAFE SHOOTING ENVIRONMENT AS WELL.     ALL EQUIPMENT ASSOCIATED WITH AN INDOOR RANGE MUST BE IN GOOD WORKING ORDER AND FUNCTIONAL DURING COURSE OF FIRE (IE., PULLEYS, TARGET SYSTEM, LIGHTING, ETC.)

       The range should possess a public address system available during firearms training.

       The range should possess some type of ON-SITE classroom/instructional facility with marking board and/or chalkboard, and seating for a minimum of 25 students.     If a classroom is not available, a covered or enclosed area with seating for a minimum of 25 students, free from the elements, must be available for instructional purposes. 

       The range shall possess a secure storage area dedicated exclusively to DHS under the resultant contract.

       The range shall possess adequate parking to accommodate a minimum of 15 vehicles.

       The range rules cannot disallow movement between firing points or restrict movement-oriented firearms at firing points by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions).     The range rules cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster or from concealment.     The ranges rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present (i.e., tactical move and shoot type drills where student/ instructor ratio would be too restrictive).     The range rules shall allow shooters to utilize weapons on fully automatic during drills.

       The estimated number days for range usage per quarter is 24 days.     The estimated number of rounds fired is 175,000 per quarter.

This does not include weekends or holidays, however, there may occasionally be circumstances wherein a day of a weekend may be needed. 

Should weather (i.e., rainout) or unforeseen circumstances prevent the use of the range, DHS will have priority in re-scheduling those missed days within the same month if possible, or the following month if not possible.       

       The range shall be within a 75 minute commute of Highway 290 and Beltway 8.     The 75-minute commute will be assessed in consideration of prime, rush hour traffic in both the morning and late afternoon/early evening.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request for Information (RFI) for Host-Based Security Manager Support
<SOLNBR>RFI326
<RESPDATE>070805
<CONTACT>Anne Keller, Contract Specialist, Phone 618-229-9504, Fax 618-229-9440, Email Anne.Keller@disa.mil
<DESC>CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE DUE DATE FOR RESPONSES, DATE OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE MEETING AND THE DATE OF THE GOTS/COTS DEMONSTRATION DAY.  CHANGES ARE SPECIFIED BELOW.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR HOST-BASED SECURITY MANAGER SUPPORT.


SUBJECT:

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) for host-based security tools and centralized manager applications that could be deployed on host-machines across the DoD. Traditional efforts to secure Department of Defense (DoD) networks have been focused on placing defenses at the network boundary with less emphasis on end-point or host-based security. While such defenses as network firewalls and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) have proven effective at countering identifiable threats originating from outside the network boundary, they do not address the insider threat or defend against external threats that are able to penetrate boundary defenses or enter through backdoors. Such threats include viruses, worms or other attacks that target known or previously unknown operating system and application-specific vulnerabilities. In order to address the insider threat, increase end-point security, reduce end-point management requirements, and provide defense in depth, DoD is considering integrating existing capabilities and fielding enhanced host-based security products and associated integrated managers across the enterprise. 

Under the host-based security concept, security products are installed directly on network end-points. In general, this means installing agent-based tools on host machines (e.g., workstations, laptops, servers). In order to be effective across enterprise networks, host-based capabilities must be centrally managed to support installation, monitoring, updating, and configuration however, existing security product management requires an independent manager for each of the multiple products, in effect, reducing time available for detection and response efforts as a result of the excessive redundant management requirements.

DoD intends to integrate existing security products and capabilities, eliminate redundant management processes, and enhance end-point security through a unified security product and management suite. The intent is to reduce the impact of management traffic and redundancy of end-point security agents. For this RFI, the following descriptions will be used: 

Central Manager: The portion of the host-based security manager suite that provides the central management functionality is called the central manager.  The central manager provides centralized installation, management, monitoring, and configuration of host-based Information Assurance (IA) capabilities. This central manager will reside at Tier 3, however it must be able to accept policy and configuration changes from higher-level tiers. Security information collected by Tier 3 central managers will report to higher tiers as well as an external security information manager (SIM). 

Host Agent/Modules(s): Those tools (or portions of tools), which actually perform the tasks associated with protecting host machines, are referred to as modules in this RFI. The local host capability to communicate with the central manager and control modules is referred as the host-based agent or just agent.  The capabilities listed in Section 3.0 could be provided either by a single agent with multiple modules, the use of multiple agents/modules, or a combination of the two. Each module will implement the security policies to be enforced using a set of rules that may be modified by the central manager. 

Additional definitions regarding the functions and designations of host-based security components are given in Attachment 3. A copy of Attachment 3 can be obtained from either Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr. Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.


DESCRIPTION:

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), in support of the Computer Network Defense (CND) mission assigned to the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), is seeking information from industry, academia, and government that will assist in the deployment of host-based security capabilities to enhance the CND posture of the DoD computer network systems. 
The DoD host-based security concept for acquiring and implementing capabilities on DoD computers and computing platforms follows the Network Operations (NetOps) Joint Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the Global Information Grid. Under the NetOps CONOPS, the DoD is organized into three tiers to conduct CND. Tier 1 provides DoD-wide CND operational direction and support to all DoD components. Tier 2 provides DoD component-wide operational direction or support and responds to direction from Tier 1. Tier 3 provides local operational direction and support and responds to direction from a designated Tier 2 entity. Tier 1 entities include the CDRUSSTRATCOM and supporting entities, such as the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO), CND Service Certification Authorities (DISA and the National Security Agency [NSA]), the CND Law Enforcement and Counterintelligence Center, and the National Security Incident Response Center. Tier 2 includes CND Service Providers designated by Heads of Components to coordinate Component-wide CND and associated major command entities. Tier 3 includes all entities responding to direction from DoD Component Tier 2 CND Service Providers, e.g., local control centers that manage and control information systems, networks and services, either deployed or fixed at DoD installations. A copy of Attachment 1 can be obtained from the either Capt Strakos or Mr. Carr. Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.


REQUIREMENTS:

This section describes the desired capabilities for the Host-based Security Manager. The DoD does not expect that any one product will have all of the capabilities listed however, a goal of the Host-based Security Manager is to provide as many of these capabilities as possible under a single management architecture. A solution with multiple products under a single manager is acceptable for the purpose of this RFI. Individual products with a subset of these capabilities are also of interest, and vendors and/or government organizations with these solutions are encouraged to respond to this RFI. A copy of Attachment 2 can be obtained from the either Capt Strakos or Mr. Carr.  Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.
 
Agent Control / Management:

Central Manager: Provides centralized installation, management, monitoring, and configuration of host-based Information Assurance (IA) capabilities.

Agent / Module Characteristics:

Agent: Provides agent software to be installed on host systems that reports to the central management server.  The configuration of the agent and the modules it controls will be managed from the central management server.

Modular Protection: Implements security policies to be enforced using a set of rules that are disseminated and updated by the central manager.

Alert Generation: Sends alerts to the central manager and SIM, as configured, when rules are enforced or other auditable events occur.

Access Control or Communications Management:

Ports, Protocols, and Services Control and Management: Provides control over inbound and outbound external network traffic as well as services running on a host.

Application Wrapper: Monitors and controls the inputs and outputs of an application.

OS Wrapper: Monitors security-relevant procedure calls to the operating system (OS) kernel.

File Protection: Protects files and directories from malicious /unauthorized activity.

Registry Protection: Prevents unauthorized changes to the registry settings.

Signature-based Detection:

File Integrity Checking: Inventories properties of known objects (intended to be a fingerprint/hash).

Anti-virus: Monitors status and provides updates to currently installed anti-virus software.

Anti-spyware/adware (Malware): Monitors status and provides updates to currently installed anti-spyware/adware software.

Intrusion Detection: Signature-based IDS examines traffic passing through network interface cards (NIC) or virtual equivalents.

Intrusion Prevention: Provides an automated response capability based on configurable conditions.

Behavior-based Detection:

Anomaly Detection (machine/user profiling): Monitors status and provides updates to anomaly detection software.

Process Monitor: Detects and sends alerts for anomalous process activity or initiation.

Policy Violations: Detects policy violations or misuse and alerts based on rules.

Security Configuration Management:

Hardware/Software Inventory: Real-time or controlled reports of host information.

Audit Log Filtering and Reporting: Performs real-time audit reduction and alerting.

Application Status Monitoring: Audits application installation.

Non-compliant Host Quarantine: Limits communication from a non-compliant host to only approved resources based on its configuration.

System Snapshot Generation and Comparison: Captures current system configuration and compares it against a baseline.

Granular Device Control: Applies fine-grained access controls to internal and external devices.

Boot Sequence Authentication: Authenticates the boot sequence.

Kernel Integrity Monitor: Monitors the integrity of the OS kernel independent of the OS.

OS Service Monitor: Monitors the execution path of vulnerable OS services to prevent buffer overflow exploits.

Execution Control: Prevents the execution of unauthorized executables.

Information Tracking / Management:

Honey Token or Beaconing: Selectively deploys embedded code that allows for the unique identification of data or products generated on a particular host machine or by a particular user.

Data Tagging: Applies cryptographically bound metadata tags, which tell what classification a document possess as well as other distribution and releasability attributes.

Post-delivery Content Management: Controls access to data and information after dissemination.

SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE:

<RESPDATE>071305
<ARCHDATE>09112005
<CONTACT>michael.hier, 7325321523
<DESC>The Product Manager Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) is conducting market research to determine night vision drivers enhancement sensor system availability for possible use in Army Tactical Wheeled Vehicles.  The Government is looking for a 'sensor s  ystem', meaning an imager and display mounted on the vehicle.  The drivers display must be located inside the cab and mounted in a flip-down configuration (must be flat panel and not a heads-up-display).  The imager can be mounted at any point on the veh i cle that allows the driver to see the road ahead.  Key performance parameters of interest include: (1) The threshold capability for the drivers viewing system shall allow the driver to see and drive the vehicle at speeds up to 55 MPH during periods of d ar kness, and during other degraded visibility conditions (smoke, fog, haze, rain, sandstorms, etc) a t 40 MPH.  The objective capability will allow the driver to operate the TWV at speeds up to 70 MPH during periods of darkness and in conditions of other deg raded visibility conditions (smoke, fog, haze, rain, sandstorms, etc).(2)System shall have a flip-down viewing screen that is easily accessible to the driver.(3) System shall be removable by the vehicle operator and installed into the basic mounting ki t of     another vehicle within 30 minutes (threshold). Key parameters are: (1) Thermal Sensor: wavelength: 8-12 micrometer, allows driver to follow a lead vehicle generating a dust signature, or any general obscurant to visibility and allows driving durin g period s of darkness.(2)Display: allows driver to maintain a relaxed driving position while viewing the image, provides unity of magnification, and allows for brightness adjustments during day/night operation Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) target  is $6,00 0 for the system. The nonvariable total system cost includes all components to be delivered and installed on light, medium, and heavy Tactical Wheeled Vehicles to include armored variants.  The camera e ngine will have power supplied externally. For evalua tion purposes, each potential source is requested to provide a brief description of work previously or currently being performed, which specifically demonstrates the contractor's ability to successfully satisfy the requirement description herein . Firms are also invited to submit any literature, brochures, or references necessary to support claims of being able to meet or exceed the requirement.  In addition, responses must include the following: name and address of firm; commercial activity/gover nment entit y (CAGE) code; size of business relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code; and, point of contact name, title, phone, and email.

<SUBJECT>A--60,000 BTU/HR Improved Environmental Control Unit (60K IECU) Program Request for Proposal
<SOLNBR>W909MY-05-R-0007
<RESPDATE>082505
<ARCHDATE>10242005
<CONTACT>Patricia Davis, 703-325-1713
<DESC>This announcement is being issued to amend the previous Pre-solicitation Announcement for RFP W909MY-05-R-0007 for 60,000 BTU/HR Improved Environmental Control Unit (60K IECU).  It is now expected that the RFP will be issued on or about 11 July 2005.   In addition, the original announcement is amended to include FedBizOpps Numbered Note 12 which was inadvertantly left off of the original announcement.  The full announcement is as follows: It is the intent of the C-E LCMC Acquisition Center Washington t o issue a competitive Request for Proposal for the 60,000 BTU/HR Improved Environmental Control Unit (60K IECU) program.  The 60K IECU program is a joint Army and Air Force effort to replace heavy and inefficient field environmental control units that util ize ozone-depleting refrigerants.  The proposed full and open competitive acquisition will result in a single contract award.  The single acquisition will be executed in three phases:  1) an 18-month Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase, 2) a 6-month Firm-Fixed-Price option for the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Phase, and 3) 5 one-year Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity options for the Full Rate Production (FRP) Phase.  During the SDD p hase, the selected contractor will be required to design and fabricate 8 prototype 60K IECUs to support Production Qualification Testing, Logistics Demonstration and a field user evaluation . If the LRIP option is exercised, the contractor will be required to deliver 60 LRIP units for First Article Testing.  If exercised, the FRP phase will occur over a 5 one year periods and it is anticipated that a maximum of 5,747 IECUs will be acquired du ring this phase.  The 60K IECU will be a replacement for the existing Army 54,000-Btu/hr ECU and the Air Force developed 66,000-Btu/hr Field Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU).  The 60K IECU will be much lighter in weight than these existing mil itary standard ECUs which are currently used to provide environmental control capability to Force Provider, Deployable Medical Systems, Tactical Operations Centers, and other joint services including the Air Force.  The need for the lightweight 60K IECU is  shared by all services especially the Army and Air Force who are striving to reduce the logistics footprint and increase system deployability.  Present and emerging command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissanc e (C4ISR) systems require environmental control to moderate the environmental temperatures in which these systems operate.  The key performance driver and constraint for military systems today and in the future is system weight.  Additionally, the primary shortcoming is that refrigerants for existing military standard (MIL-STD) ECUs use ozone depleting hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), namely HCFC-22.   This ozone depleting chemical has been regulated according to a specific schedule that prohibits its manuf acture after 1 January 2010, and bans its use altogether by 1 January 2020 for servicing of existing equipment.  These phase-out dates occur much earlier in some allied nations where the U.S. Army must continue to operate.  Additionally, existing MIL-STD ECUs are becoming increasingly unreliable due to lifecycle expiration and/or are no longer supportable by Army logistics and training systems.  MIL-STD ECUs and their associated components were designed to operate with ozone depleting refrigerants and cann ot be economically modified to accept environmentally friendly alternatives.  These ECUs in all sizes and configurations will not meet stated domestic legal requirements or international agreements and shall be used until no longer repairable and then repl aced with the Family of IECUs.  A recent revalidation to the IECU ORD was approved that identified new requirements for 60K Btu/hr and 120K Btu/hr capacity IECU systems. Performance parameters set forth in the ORD include red uced power consumption, reduced weight/logistics footprint, increased reliability, compatible with current military shelter systems as 'drop-in' replacement for MIL-SD ECUs including FDECU, elimination of ozone depleting refrigerants and designed to field and sustainment level maintenance.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on the Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP), https://abop.monmouth.army.mil on or about 11 July 2005.  No hard copies or copies via email will be available.  Response s shall also be submitted via the IBOP.  In order to use the IBOP a vendor must register by completing the following steps:  1) At the IBOP homepage select: New User Registration, under the User Services; 2) click on the Industry Button; 3) Select either t he Browse button or the Browse & Post button.

<CONTACT>MARILYN J. HUTCHISON PURCHASING AGENT 3032369321     mhutchi@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), National Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS), has a requirement for A&E Services to complete construction documents, including specifications, floor plans, and project drawings for the Classified Information Handling Facility (CIHF) located at the National Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  This will  be a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) approximately 2,000 square feet in size.  This facility will house an extensive archive of remote sensed data of the Earth.  The purpose of this notice is to announce the intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with CTA Architects and Engineering, Billings, Montana.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Suppliers will Satisfy Agency Requirement for continuation of design and production of construction drawings for the facility.  Completion of this project is a follow on effort of Feasibility Study previously provided by CTA under a previous contract.  It has been determined that replacing CTA with a new firm would severely burden the government with a loss of critical knowledge in architectural, engineering, and scientific details needed for this new facility and would lead to delays due to time lost in bringing a new contractor up to speed which would produce a substantial duplication of costs that would likely not be recovered through competition.  This is not a request for proposal.  However, if another firm believes it can perform these services without a negative impact to the project, they are invited to submit an affirmative response.  Should additional sources be identified who feel they can complete the requirement without a loss of time or duplication of costs, they are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement within 15 days of this notice.  An affirmative response must include a demonstration of their ability to provide an equivalent service, rationale as to why they should be considered, and demonstration that a new A&E firm would not negatively impact costs, quality, or schedule.  This information will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information shall be considered non-responsive, without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV requires additional software toolkits for our JACK digital human modeling software package.  

The proposed contract action announces the Governments intent to issue a purchase order, on a sole-source basis in accordance with FAR 302-1(b)(1)(i), to USG Corporation, Waltham, MA.  This procurement is for additional software toolkits for our JACK digital human modeling software package.  These toolkits will be used to study/analyze issues associated with human fit, form, and function – such as anthropometry, postural analysis, comfort, human performance, and task performance.  The 3D Bodyscan Module will allow PTB researchers to use the CAESAR database within the JACK software package.  This will allow researchers to create digital humans from actual human 3D body scans.  The Task Analysis Toolkit will add the functionality to calculate forces/loading on the spine of the digital humans created within JACK.  This toolkit will allow researchers to apply loads to the digital humans performing different tasks and then analyze the forces on the body, including spinal loading, fatigue parameters, and strength predictions.  Finally, the Motion Capture Toolkit will allow PTB researchers to tie in either our PEAK or ProReflex motion cameras to record real human motion and apply it to digital humans.  This toolkit will also provide the ability to tie in DSR’s Virtual Reality Laboratory to create scenarios that an actual person can perform while simultaneously having the digital human perform the same task.  Once captured the digital model can be analyzed and evaluated further.  These additional toolkits will allow PTB researchers to combine data from the Human Factors Laboratory, the Anthropometry Laboratory, and the Virtual Reality Laboratory to create better, more realistic digital human models for studying human performance issues related to occupational safety and health.  

This is not a request for competitive quotes, and no solicitation is available.   Any interested parties  may identify themselves to the contracting officer no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Submit information to Rebecca Mullenax, MS-L1019, Reference:  000HCCB7-2005-23338, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.   The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources exist, therefore, no solicitation will be issued.  If no responses are received within 15 days, award will be made to UGS Corporation.  Award will be made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) without further notices being issued.  All responses received shall be considered by the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR HOST-BASED SECURITY MANAGER SUPPORT.


SUBJECT:

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) for host-based security tools and centralized manager applications that could be deployed on host-machines across the DoD.  Traditional efforts to secure Department of Defense (DoD) networks have been focused on placing defenses at the network boundary with less emphasis on end-point or host-based security.  While such defenses as network firewalls and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) have proven effective at countering identifiable threats originating from outside the network boundary, they do not address the insider threat or defend against external threats that are able to penetrate boundary defenses or enter through backdoors.  Such threats include viruses, worms or other attacks that target known or previously unknown operating system and application-specific vulnerabilities.  In order to address the insider threat, increase end-point security, reduce end-point management requirements, and provide defense in depth, DoD is considering integrating existing capabilities and fielding enhanced host-based security products and associated integrated managers across the enterprise. 

Under the host-based security concept, security products are installed directly on network end-points.  In general, this means installing agent-based tools on host machines (e.g., workstations, laptops, servers).  In order to be effective across enterprise networks, host-based capabilities must be centrally managed to support installation, monitoring, updating, and configuration however, existing security product management requires an independent manager for each of the multiple products, in effect, reducing time available for detection and response efforts as a result of the excessive redundant management requirements.

DoD intends to integrate existing security products and capabilities, eliminate redundant management processes, and enhance end-point security through a unified security product and management suite.  The intent is to reduce the impact of management traffic and redundancy of end-point security agents.  For this RFI, the following descriptions will be used: 

Central Manager: The portion of the host-based security manager suite that provides the central management functionality is called the central manager.  The central manager provides centralized installation, management, monitoring, and configuration of host-based Information Assurance (IA) capabilities.  This central manager will reside at Tier 3, however it must be able to accept policy and configuration changes from higher-level tiers. Security information collected by Tier 3 central managers will report to higher tiers as well as an external security information manager (SIM). 

Host Agent/Modules(s):  Those tools (or portions of tools), which actually perform the tasks associated with protecting host machines, are referred to as modules in this RFI.  The local host capability to communicate with the central manager and control modules is referred as the host-based agent or just agent.  The capabilities listed in Section 3.0 could be provided either by a single agent with multiple modules, the use of multiple agents/modules, or a combination of the two.  Each module will implement the security policies to be enforced using a set of rules that may be modified by the central manager. 

Additional definitions regarding the functions and designations of host-based security components are given in Attachment 3.  A copy of Attachment 3 can be obtained from either Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr.  Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.


DESCRIPTION:

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), in support of the Computer Network Defense (CND) mission assigned to the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), is seeking information from industry, academia, and government that will assist in the deployment of host-based security capabilities to enhance the CND posture of the DoD computer network systems. 
The DoD host-based security concept for acquiring and implementing capabilities on DoD computers and computing platforms follows the Network Operations (NetOps) Joint Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the Global Information Grid.  Under the NetOps CONOPS, the DoD is organized into three tiers to conduct CND.  Tier 1 provides DoD-wide CND operational direction and support to all DoD components.  Tier 2 provides DoD component-wide operational direction or support and responds to direction from Tier 1.  Tier 3 provides local operational direction and support and responds to direction from a designated Tier 2 entity.  Tier 1 entities include the CDRUSSTRATCOM and supporting entities, such as the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO), CND Service Certification Authorities (DISA and the National Security Agency [NSA]), the CND Law Enforcement and Counterintelligence Center, and the National Security Incident Response Center.  Tier 2 includes CND Service Providers designated by Heads of Components to coordinate Component-wide CND and associated major command entities.  Tier 3 includes all entities responding to direction from DoD Component Tier 2 CND Service Providers, e.g., local control centers that manage and control information systems, networks and services, either deployed or fixed at DoD installations.  A copy of Attachment 1 can be obtained from the either Capt Strakos or Mr. Carr. Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.


REQUIREMENTS:

This section describes the desired capabilities for the Host-based Security Manager.  The DoD does not expect that any one product will have all of the capabilities listed however, a goal of the Host-based Security Manager is to provide as many of these capabilities as possible under a single management architecture.  A solution with multiple products under a single manager is acceptable for the purpose of this RFI.  Individual products with a subset of these capabilities are also of interest, and vendors and/or government organizations with these solutions are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  A copy of Attachment 2 can be obtained from the either Capt Strakos or Mr. Carr.  Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.

<DESC>The Rapid Equipping Force was originally formed at the direction of the Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army (VCSA) to develop strategies and methodologies to swiftly introduce materiel innovations into the U.S. Army by taking emerging techn ologies to operational environments for initial field evaluation.  As a result of its successful record, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army (CSA) directed the VCSA to institutionalize the REF as an independent operating activity with an expanded mission scope, supporting current and future Army requirements.  The CSAs intent for the REF is to fulfill the following three functions: Insertions into the Current Force.  The REF will continue to insert technology and capability enhancements into the c urrent force as it conducts the Global War on Terrorism thereby enhancing its ability to successfully execute its mission; Acceleration of Technology Transfer.  The REF will pull emerging technologies and future force capability surrogates into the current  operational environment to accelerate technology transfer and hasten its achievement of desired future force capabilities; and Agent of Change.  The REF, through its assessment and evaluation of current Army processes, will serve as an agent of change, to  model potential changes to current Army business practices.  A recent capability gap analysis has identified the following as they apply to the current force: soldier protection in counter-insurgency environment, protection of the force in counter insurge ncy operations and ability to conduct joint urban operations.  The analysis also identified the following as they apply to the future force: enhancement of individual soldier protection, enhancement of platform/group protection, modular and tailorable forc es, and sustainment of modular forces.  The REF is seeking proposals through this broad agency announcement for small vehicles that can bridge the gap between the soldier and the HUMMV.  Submissions shall not exceed 50 pages and shall provide adequate info rmation for our peer review team to assess its viability.  Your submission shall also include your estimated cost to produce 3 prototypes of your design and a limited production run of 10 additional units.  Submissions will be evaluated for technical feas ility, to include use of the latest innovations in maneuverability, drive train, power plant, communications and robotics.  Your proposal shall also include information on your production capability.  The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptanc e shall be technical, importance to the program, production capability and fund availability.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall be considered to the extent appropriate when considering fund availability.   Proposal shall be submitted electronically to  Maj Jorge Concepcion at jorge.concepcion@us.army.mil.  Proposals must be received NLT 2:00 PM EDT on 25 Jul 2005.  All interested parties may submit a proposal.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 336992 with a small business size standard of 1,000 em ployees.

<DESC>USDA Forest Service, Fire and Aviation Support Branch at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, with this Special Notice advises all interested parties and vendors of the postponement of issuance of the proposed solicitation for the services of National Type 2 IA firefighting crews for the 2005 fire season. The revision of the current contract requirement for these services has not been accomplished within a time frame by which the exigencies of the current fire season have not unduly interfered with the Government’s ability to effectively solicit and evaluate proposals or award contracts for these firefighting services.  The Government’s urgent and compelling need for the continued availability of crews under the current contract is provided as justification for an extension, on a sole source basis, of the crews currently under contract.  The proposed contract period extension will encompass the remainder of the 2005 fire season, but in no case will extend beyond December 31, 2005.  Resolution of proposed contract requirements and provisions are ongoing and there is a reasonable expectation that a Request for Proposals for a new contract will be published in FedBizOpps before December 31, 2005.

<SUBJECT>--Sole Source Contract - HLB Decisions
<DESC>1.  HLB Decisions built a vessel trip cost (VTC) model for Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence Seaway as part of a study for the International Joint Commission.  The work was completed under contract with Transport Canada and under the direction of a j oint U.S-Canadian Commercial Navigation Work Group (one of the co-leads being the Buffalo District).  Currently, the Corps of Engineers is working on a complementary study that considers Lake Ontario, the St. Lawrence Seaway and lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan  and Superior  the rest of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway (GLSLS).  This study is a multi-agency, U.S-Canada study jointly managed by Transport Canada and the Detroit District (CELRE).  Other USACE districts (Huntington, Buffalo, Louisville, and New England) are participating in the study.   2.  The GLSLS Economics team is building a system economic model that includes a VTC module and a Lock Risk Module.  Though no VTC module for the entire GLSLS navigation system exists, HLB has, as stated above, developed such a model for Lake Ontario and t he St. Lawrence Seaway.  The other necessary module, the Lock Risk Module, is being developed for the system economic model by Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  This module needs to link to the VTC module.   3.  HLB Decisions has unique knowledge of the computer code that will allow them to: 1) expand their existing VTC model to cover the entire GLSLS navigation system and 2) ensure that the Lock Risk Module links properly to the VTC module.  The LRD Navigatio n Planning Center requests a sole source contract with HLB Decisions to make the necessary modifications to the VTC module so that it to covers the entire GLSLS and links properly with the Lock Risk Module.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/SOLE SOURCE Initially this is a combined synopsis/solicitation for "sole source" wherein the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Integrated Service Network 23(VISN 23), Minneapolis, MN will negotiate a purchase order under FAR Part 13 for a sole source contract with Clarkson College Professional Development section under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-04. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition. This procurement is a follow-on procurement for a Coding Certification Review Course. The current contractor has knowledge and experience with the VA culture of Network 23 as well as a good understanding our unique coding requirements. The delivery of this course requires an AAPC certified instructor to meet requirements for the certification process. Clarkson College provided the same course for former VISN 14 in 2000. The same instructor will be utilized to provide this training. Although the content of this course is not VA-specific, having an instructor who is familiar with the VA culture and coding/billing issues impacting the VA Health Care System are critical in order to respond effectively to student questions. Videoconference technology will be utilized to provide this training to staff at all network facilities. This is the same technology that was utilized for this program when it was presented in 2000 so the instructor is familiar with the technology. This will avoid a natural learning curve that would exist if a new instructor was used who is not familiar with this technology. Since this course will be 20 weeks in duration and the instructor needs to be at the Omaha VA in order to present the training it is critical that the instructor be local to the Omaha area to avoid excessive travel fees that would occur by bringing in an instructor from another location. SCOPE OF WORK The purpose of this contract is to provide a series of videoconference training sessions designed to increase knowledge about coding practices, improve the accuracy of coding and prepare VA coding staff to achieve certification in coding through the American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC). The vendor is responsible for providing the following: Organize and conduct the AAPC Certification Review course; Provide an AAPC certified instructor to conduct the training sessions; Training sessions will be 2 hours in length, conducted twice a week for 20 weeks for a total of 80 hours of training. Content will address coding procedures for both outpatient and inpatient settings. Obtain and distribute AAPC textbooks and workbooks for each student (cost of the materials is the responsibility of the VA) Proctor the AAPC certification examination and provide AAPC certification upon successful completion of the exam. The VA will be responsible for the following: Provide a group of 10 or more individuals who have successfully completed high school, or its GED equivalent, to take the course as a group; It is estimated we currently have approximately 30 individuals who require the training.  Provide classroom space at each site with videoconference capability to facilitate instruction; Support staff attendance at the training sessions by providing necessary coverage to allow staff to leave their work area for 4 hours each week for a total of 20 weeks. Videotape each of the training sessions EVALUATION FACTORS APPLICABLE TO THIS SOLICITATION: Criteria to consider in vendor selection: AAPC certified instructor is required.  Instructor needs to be familiar with presenting training utilizing videoconference technology. Instructor needs to be located in Omaha to be accessible to the videoconference classroom located at the VA to eliminate the need for paying travel expenses for 40 class sessions over a 5-month period. Technical capability to provide deliverables listed above must be identified. Past performance: Identify government contracts and or private contracts of a similar scope and complexity of this procurement. Price: Technical and past performance when combined will be more important than price.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. All proposals received by 4:00PM Central Daylight Time, July 7, 2005 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Offerors to provide a detailed written and signed proposal on company letterhead or other proposal forms, including pricing, for these services. Offerors are further required to provide Representations and Certifications as identified below.

The Technical Proposal shall include:

The Technical Proposal shall include:

•	Technical Approach
•	Organizational Experience & Past Performance 

1.  Key Personnel (maximum 3 pages per resume, no limit on the total number of resumes)

Provide a description of the experience, skills and capabilities of each of the key personnel on your proposed project team.  Descriptions shall include the quality and depth of experience of proposed personnel in working on similar projects in terms of background, education, work experience, and accomplishments.  Descriptions shall demonstrate the knowledge that key personnel have gained through completed and ongoing efforts on similar projects.  "Similar projects" is meant to convey similarity in subject matter, dollar value, duration, and complexity.

2.  Technical Approach 

A technical approach is required from each Offeror.  The approach shall be simple, easy to read, and shall clearly and concisely describe project responsibilities and personnel, any proposed subcontracting or teaming arrangements, communication and coordination, scheduling of all tasks and subtasks, meetings, and deliverables.  All staff needed to conduct the work and produce all required products and deliverables must be identified.  In meeting deliverables, Offerors shall elaborate on how they plan to measure their efforts to ensure the highest quality of performance.


3.  Organizational Experience & Past Performance

Describe the experience and capability of your organization and key personnel in conducting similar work.

EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS

Each Offeror’s proposal shall be evaluated according to the factors shown below. The factors are roughly equal to each other.  

FACTOR A: Key Personnel

•	Availability and qualifications of the proposed staff, their experience in similar projects and their capability to fully and professionally accomplish the objectives stated herein;
•	Ability to communicate both orally and in writing with both technical staff and senior management.
•	Consideration of the required knowledge, skills and abilities as specified in the SOW. 

FACTOR B: Technical Approach 

•	Understanding of the work, including creativity, thoroughness and innovation shown in planned execution of the requirements in the SOW;
•	Discussion of specific methods and techniques for completing each discrete task;
•	Anticipation of potential problem areas, and creativity and feasibility of solutions to problems; and
•	Discussion of schedule and any other issues about which the Government should be aware.


FACTOR C: Organizational Experience

CONTRACT AWARD: Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and cost considered. The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost. Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between proposals that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror.

The name and telephone number of the individual to contact for information regarding the solicitation: Contract Specialist Kurt Verner, (916) 231-1525.  This requirement is to provide Local Telephone Service for DMEA as defined herein.  The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain local telephone communications  service and support.  Included in the contract are provisions for the reuse of the existing PBX and if needed the purchase of and interface between the PBX and new phone service line.  1.1  Background: Telephone service for DMEA employees and DMEA customers is a vital part of the engineering process.   Long distance is provided for under another DMEA contract and is not a part of this agreement.  1.2  Location: 4234 54th Street, McClellan, CA, 95652.  1.3 Additional Information: The NPA for DMEA is 916.  The present NXXs for DMEA are 231 and 414.  2.0 Definitions: The following definitions are given for the purpose of this contract:  demarc:  A demarc (an abbreviation for demarcation point) marks the point where communications facilities owned by one organization interface with that of another organization. In telephone terminology, this is the interface between customer-premises equipment and telecommunications  service provider’s equipment.  A synonym is network terminating interface (NTI).  NPA: Numbering Plan Area (telephony, AKA: Area Code).  NXX: Network Numbering Exchange (in North American Numbering Plan).  3.0 Requirements:  3.1 Location: The telecommunication circuit shall be installed at 4234 54th Street, McClellan, CA 95652. The contractor shall install a telecommunications circuit and provide telecommunications service.  The telecommunication communication circuit shall be installed in room 159.  Installation shall be accomplished so as to minimize downtime of DMEA’s telephone connection and service. Additional work shall be performed at the contractor’s site as needed in support of this contract.  3.2 Current equipment and related information: At present, DMEA uses a PBX switch made by Tadiran. Local telephone service is provided over ISDN via PRI. Reuse of the existing PBX shall be a requirement of this contract.   DMEA uses an Adtran T1 CSU (Ace) as the interface between the phone company circuit and one PRI card installed in the Tadiran switch that accepts the PRI circuit (23 ISDN channels). We have a spare T1 card that was used  with our previous T1 service.   DMEA calls go out from the lower ISDN channels up, and incoming calls come from the higher ISDN channels down. DMEA has never run out of open channels for our calling needs – usually many channels are idle. The number of channels shall not be reduced by this  new contract.  3.3 Work to be performed: The contractor shall install all necessary hardware as required to provide the telephone communication service to DMEA.  The new telecommunications circuit and service shall be fully operational within 30 days ARO.  The Contractor shall submit a Site Preparation Plan to the Contracting Officer within 10 days ARO. The Site Preparation Plan shall identify all changes required of Government-provided space in order to deliver services.  All costs associated with any site changes will be determined and negotiated.  DMEA will approve or request changes to the site preparation plan within 5 business days.   After submission and acceptance of the Site Preparation Plan, further alterations or modifications in the site preparation plan which are directly attributable to failure to adequately identify changes initially shall be furnished at no cost to the Government, and any additional non-recurring and recurring charges attributable to those alterations or modifications shall unless directed by the Government be borne by the Contractor.  3.4 Security: The contractor is required to provide advance notification prior to conducting any on-site inspection, installation or maintenance.  A two (2) hour minimum notice during normal business hours shall be given.  In general, all installation and maintenance work will be performed by US citizens.  Exceptions to this can be made (1) if no US Citizen is capable of performing the work and (2) with the advance approval of the DMEA director.  Contractor personnel shall provide proof of citizenship in accordance with the DMEA visitor approval process in effect at the time the visit is requested and prior to being allowed entry into DMEA facilities.  During periods of exceptionally heightened security, additional advance notice and background investigations of contractor personnel may be required prior to gaining entry into DMEA. DMEA may at that time require additional minimum notice during normal business hours be given.  Exceptions to these requirements can only be made with approval of the DMEA director.  Exceptions generally require 5-10 working days advance notice.  3.5 Applicable standards: All preparations shall be in compliance with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Electronic Industries Association (EIA), National Electrical Code, and all state and local codes.  3.6 Acceptance criteria: The contractor shall develop and conduct an acceptance test that demonstrates to DMEA that all requirements of this contract have been met.  The initial acceptance test shall be conducted and successfully completed immediately after installation of the new telephone communication circuits.  3.7 Special requirements: The following special requirements apply to this contract:  3.7.1 The contractor shall provide a cut over plan that brings up trunk service at least 3 days prior to the agreed cut over.  The plan shall cover installation and testing of the circuit to prove stability to DMEA representative. Circuit must remain up for three days before cut over will be attempted. Cut over test will be done no later than the weekend prior to the agreed cut over date. DIDs (Directed Inward Dialing) will be moved to the new service and after testing, the trunk shall remain operating to handle all inbound traffic. PBX will be reconfigured by DMEA during the cutover to allow outbound calls to be routed out the new service. Downtime during normal work hours (6 AM to 6 PM Monday through Friday) shall not exceed 2 hours total during the change over.  3.7.2 The contractor shall reuse the existing PBX equipment and interface cards to the greatest extent possible.  If the interface card between the PBX and the contractor provided circuit must be replaced, the contractor shall provide and install the equipment. The contractor shall identify any needed hardware and software options to be installed on the TADIRAN PBX to ensure compatibility. The contractor shall provide any necessary cables for the new equipment.  DMEA shall own the equipment past the demarc.  3.7.3 The contractor shall be responsible for the installation, configuration and integration of all equipment affected by this contract including but not limited to the telecommunications circuit interface if required, the data communication circuit, and the router.  3.7.4 The contractor shall ensure that DMEA has the continued use (number portability) of its existing phone numbers.  DMEA has 300 DIDs -- 275 are 231 (1505 to 1679 and 2801 to 2900) exchange (1505 to 1679 and 2801 to 2900) and 25 are 414 exchange (0343 to 0367).  3.7.5 The telecommunications circuit shall be fully operational on a 24 hour 7 day schedule at least 99.9% of the time.

Using this system, DMEA shall be notified of problems affecting the service by at least one and preferably at least two of the following methods: phone, fax, or email.  3.7.7 The contractor shall submit monthly invoices to the Government billing address shown on the applicable order by the 20th of the month following the month in which the charges occurred.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The following criteria are critical and bidders are required to demonstrate their ability to comply with these criteria when submitting their proposals.  Failure to provide any one element in this section shall be cause for elimination from consideration:  Contractor shall certify their ability to meet all requirements of each of the paragraphs in Section 3.  Contractor shall clearly identify the costs for installation and for operation of the telephone circuit for the initial year and for four option years.   Preference shall be for fixed monthly cost for unlimited usage.  Contractor shall provide a tentative plan, including timeline, for the installations of the local phone service connection lines.

Plans shall address all aspects of the move including support for any needed configuration changes to the existing connection and the Tadiran switch.

For pricing and evaluation purposes, the following criteria are provided:  The total value of the contract should be based on either (a) a fixed monthly fee for unlimited minutes for all 5 years of the contract plus installation costs or (b) a fixed monthly fee plus per minute charges based on Jun 2004 – May 2005 average of 13532 minutes per month used plus installation costs.  In the later case, since virtually all of DMEA’s minutes are daytime minutes, DMEA will compare costs based on the assumption that 95% of our average minutes used are daytime minutes and that the remaining 5% of minutes used are equally divided between evening and nighttime minutes.  DMEA will further assume an increase of 10% per year in minutes used for each of the four option years.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

"Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.   The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.   Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.   Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C., 20593, Telephone:  202-267-2285

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Provisions of 52.212-1 through -5 apply to this acquisition.  Line item structure is for one base year and 3 one-year option years.  Performance iaw PWS attached. Nodal Cargo Movement/Processing Model Purpose The purpose of this project is support of the in-house rewrite of the Port Simulation model (PORTSIM) into a non-proprietary simulation language.  All work must be compatible with Old Dominion Universitys (ODU) DIESEL simulation engine and Programmable Pr ocess Flow Network (PPFN) process flow language.  This project is in support of the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command-Transportation Engineering Agencys (SDDC-TEA) mission.  Background PORTSIM is a discrete-event computer simulation of military equipment moving through commercial seaports.  It provides the military planners with the capability to compare seaports of embarkation (SPOE) and debarkation (SPOD) and determine for planning pur poses, a ports throughput, infrastructure constraints, and utilization of critical resources.  Currently, PORTSIM is comprised of two separate models (SPOE and SPOD) with varying levels of capability.  The SPOD model is more robust than the SPOE model.  B oth models are written in MODSIM III, a COTS simulation language.  Since MODSIM III is no longer supported it has become necessary to migrate the PORTSIM development effort to a new, non-proprietary development environment.  This migration is currently und erway in-house using ODUs DIESEL simulation engine and PPFN process flow language.   Scope of Work.   Nodal Cargo Movement/Processing Model The current work is based on the development of a nodal model where transports move cargo between nodes.  Internal to nodes, process flow is provided by the user to dictate the activities acted upon the cargo.  This supports the development of any cargo te rminal (seaport, installation, airport, etc.) though initial efforts will focus on development of PORTSIM.  This improves upon previous versions of PORTSIM by supporting user control over the internal processes without requiring reprogramming the simulatio n and removing dependencies on proprietary simulation languages. The new system will be built upon the DIESEL simulation engine and the Programmable Process Flow Network (PPFN) process flow language, both developed by ODU.  A nodal architecture will support the movement of cargo between nodes.  A process engine will the n manage execution of the processes. The compiler will allow user control over the internal processes. A graphical user interface (GUI) will oversee execution of the resulting simulation.  An output analysis system will handle collecting data the user iden tifies as interesting during simulation execution and producing useful results. Specific Tasks 1) Nodal Architecture.  The nodal architecture supports the ordering and movement of cargo between nodes.  The structure will be hierarchical to manage movement between cargo terminals as well as between functional areas within a cargo terminal. Development activities: a)	Design and implement nodal structure b)	Design and implement interconnect mechanism c)	Document design of nodal structure 2) Process Engine.  The process engine executes the user-defined processes within each node of the network. Development activities: a)	Design an assembly language describing the process execution b)	Design and implement data structures to capture the execution state c)	Model and implement the activities capable of executing the processes 3) Compiler.  The compiler will interface with the process definitions currently under developed by our agency in the PPFN process flow language and the  process engine under development by ODU. The process flow definitions defined in the PPFN process flow language in turn, must be compiled to produce an executable data structure.  This process flow data structure is read in by the process engine and execu ted.  This task will involve access to and the ability to work with the model architecture and DIESEL simulation engine. Development activities: a)	Develop a model of the compiler b)	Implement the compiler model  c)	Test the compilers compatibility with the process and DIESEL simulation engines  4) Output Analysis.  Norfolk State University (NSU) generated a new output analysis capability for PORTSIM v.3.0.  This capability will be replicated in the new nodal architecture.  To achieve this, statistics must be identified in the input language.  The n the appropriate entities within the simulation must be tagged for data capture and a data capture capability provided.  Then a similar output analysis capability can be utilized to process the data and report results.  Development activities: a)	Develop process of identifying statistics of interest in the simulation b)	Design a data format for the capture of data c)	Develop a data capture capability within the nodal architecture and the process engine d)	Develop and integrate an output analysis tool 5) GUI Development.  While primary GUI development will be performed by SDDC-TEA, assistance is necessary in proper GUI design and integration with the scenario files used as input to the simulation. Development activities: a)	Develop GUI model b)	Assist in GUI implementation c)	Document GUI 6) Process Development.  The process development is the primary responsibility of SDDC-TEA.  However, assistance is required to review and develop the processes within the framework of the nodal architecture and process engine.  Also, assistance will be ne cessary to test the processes during the ongoing development of the compiler and process engine.  This effort may also identify required changes in the PPFN process flow language and subsequently the compiler and process engine. Development activities: a)	Assist in process flow development b)	Test process flow c)	Modify simulation as a result of process development 7) Cargo Terminal State System.  The nodal architecture/process engine will be designed to support initialization of the system to an intermediate state, and the saving of an intermediate state.  This allows the simulation to be initialized to a current st ate to support operational work.  It also allows the simulation state to be saved, modified to reflect unforeseen changes, and restarted to observe the resulting change.   Development activities: a)	Develop a state capture format b)	Design and implement a state capture capability c)	Design and implement a state initialization capability d)	Develop an interface to support inputting/modifying states 8) Programmatic Events.  PORTSIM 3.0 included a concept called programmatic events that allowed the user to schedule changes in the simulations behavior by modifying available resources and infrastructure and by modifying processing times.  This concept w ill be developed within the nodal architecture and process engine, potentially even supporting changes in the processes. Development activities:     a)  Identify components, which are appropriate to apply programmatic events     b)  Develop a programmable events model     c)  Implement the programmatic events model 9) Testing.  The testing process will be partitioned into two phases.  The developers will perform Alpha testing. A group not involved in the development will be responsible for this testing.  Beta testing will be performed by SDDC-TEA with ongoing support  from the developers. Development activities: a)	Conduct Alpha testing b)	Assist with agency Beta testing c)	Document all testing 10) Maintenance.   Maintenance will be required for the existing SPOE and SPOD PORTSIM models that are written in MODSIM III.  This maintenance support will be necessary until the rewrite of PORTSIM in a non-proprietary simulation language is complete. After the rewrite and testing of the new PORTSIM model is complete, maintenance of this model will als o be required.  This maintenance will require extensive knowledge of the nodal architecture, process engine, DIESEL simulation engine, and PPFN process flow language.  Development activities: a)	Maintain existing MODSIM III code b)	Maintain new system c)	Provide in-house help desk support d)	Develop and provide user manuals e)	Conduct training 11) Analytical Support.   Analytical support is required for the existing SPOE and SPOD PORTSIM models and the eventually the new PORTSIM.  The operations research systems analyst (ORSA) will perform functions such as in-house port analyses.  Development activities: a)	Run PORTSIM in support of analyses  b)	Be familiar with other analytical tools such as TARGET, ELIST. MIDAS, JFAST, and JOPES c)	Research and collect pertinent model data 12) Project Management.  Management of all aspects of software design, development, implementation, testing, maintenance, life cycle management, and software validation, verification, and accreditation (VV&A) as required. Development activities: a)	Manage development timelines and schedules b)	Write all pertinent reports and life cycle documents c)	Interface the designated project officer and coordinate with any outside agencies Deliverables/Delivery Schedule. Software Releases			As modified Reports					Quarterly  --Testing --Enhancements --Bug Reports/Problems Progress Reports			Monthly Surveillance Plan. SDDCTEA will be responsible for performing inspections to confirm that the Contractor is performing the services at a satisfactory level.  The COR shall maintain records on contractors performance.

All proposals will be evaluated to determine the best value to the Government.   There are four evaluation factors:  Technical , Experience, Past Performance, and Price.  Technical, Experience and Past Performance are equal in weight.  These three eval uation factors, other than price when combined,are approximately equal to price.  Although price will not be rated during the evaluation of the proposals, it may become the determinative factor in the final selection decision when making the best value det ermination.  The Government is willing to select other than the lowest priced qualified offer, if there is a benefit to the Government, which would be clearly explained in a benefit trade-off analysis. 2.  Offerors must submit (1) Resumes that address technical and experience requirements outlined in the PWS,  (2) Past performance information  and (3) Pricing.  Failure to include required information may render your proposal non-responsive.    Factor 1.  Technical  Understanding of work to be accomplished. Sub Factor 1-1.  In depth knowledge of Port Simulation Sub Factor 1-2.  Knowledge of MODSIM III Sub Factor 1-3.  Knowledge of TARGET, ELIST, MIDAS, JFAST and JOPES Sub Factor 1-4.  Knowledge of  ODUs Diesel Simulation Engine and Pr ogrammable Process Flow Network (PPFN) process flow language Factor 2.  Experience  Ability to demonstrate experience necessary to accomplish the tasks in the Statement of Work Sub Factor 2-1.  Understanding of PORTSIM Sub Factor 2-2.  Understanding of MODSIM III Sub Factor 2-3.  Understanding of Seaports of Embarkation (SPOE) and Seaports of Debarkation (SPOD) MODSIM III structure Factor 3  Past Performance Sub Factor 3-1.  Offeror must provide demonstrated experience in the work effort. Factor:  TECHNICAL & EXPERIENCE The Evaluation Team will evaluate the personnel proposed for this effort.   The Contractor shall submit the resumes as appropriate for this requirement.  The resumes will clearly demonstrate the Skills, Knowledge and Experience as listed in the PWS, which will be evaluated to ensure they meet the qualifications and posses the knowledge and ability to perform the services required.   These qualifications contained in this list are all considered of equal importance.  Though not required, Contractors may subm it more than one, but no more than two, candidates to fulfill each position, allowing the Government to evaluate and consider more than one candidate.  Substitution of those personnel upon award is not authorized without specific approval of the Government .  Failure to adequately address this area may render the proposal unacceptable.   Factor:  PAST PERFORMANCE  	a.  The Evaluation Team and the Contracting Officer will assess each offeror's past performance to determine the risk level, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the services required under the solicitation.  Relevance of past performance is important for this acquisition.  Past Performance contains three areas to be evaluated: (1) Quality of Service (2) Timeliness of Performance and (3) Business Practices/Customer Satisfaction.  All three areas are considered of equal importanc e. 	b.  The Contractor shall submit a list of contracts (no more than 7) awarded in the past 3 years that are similar to this project, which would demonstrate the ability to successfully staff and complete this project.  The Government may contact the referen ces and determine the level of performance, or may utilize the past performance database, or a combination thereof.    Format: Name of Agency/Company Awarding Contract (include name and phone number of customer), contract number, date of performance, contract value and type of service performed. Factor:  PRICE        Technical, experience and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  Although price will not be rated during the evaluation of the proposals, it may become the determinative factor in the final selection decision when making  the best value determination.   The Government intends to award without discussions.  However, should the Government determine discussions are necessary, reserves the right to enter into discussions.   This is a best-value procurement and the Government i s willing to pay more for an increased value, especially in terms of the contractors ability to perform independently with out Government oversight.  Government oversight increases the cost of the procurement, because Government personnel have to be paid and their efforts should not have to be diverted from normal day-to-day activities (reducing their productivity) in order to assist and constantly advise the Contractor.

The following clause applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text:

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK

“DEFINITIONAL MISSION” FOR ADVISORY AND ASSISTANCE SERVICES BY NON-GOVERNMENTAL SOURCES FOR CHINA”

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. 

The purpose of this Definitional Mission (DM) is to identify environmental sector projects that will qualify for USTDA funding consideration.  The Contractor shall focus on potential projects related to air quality monitoring and emissions control, although other environmental sector projects could be considered in order to meet the requirements of this contract.  The Contractor shall also focus on environmental sector projects in the northeastern section of the country (e.g., Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Liaoning, and Jilin provinces), although environmental sector projects in other areas could also be considered.

The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed study, technical assistance or other trade capacity building activity(ies) herein after referred to as “study(ies)”;

Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.

Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures

USTDA has a dual mission of promoting US exports and advancing economic development in the host country.  USTDA would like to re-emphasize the Agency’s developmental mandate.  Toward this goal, the Agency is collecting more detailed information regarding the impact of its activities on the economic development of the host country.

What does USTDA mean by Development Impact?
USTDA’s activities impact host country economic development in a variety of ways.  There are four primary categories that are tracked and measured.  However, the Agency recognizes that there are additional ways that activities can benefit the host country.  Therefore, study contractors are encouraged to address any significant benefits. 

Category	Explanation
Infrastructure	USTDA funds feasibility studies of and technical assistance for many critically important infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications systems, water and sewerage systems or environmental improvements or enhancements, as well as projects such as refineries and manufacturing plants.  Implementation of these projects contributes to the improvement and security of the physical, financial and social infrastructure of the developing world.  
Market-Oriented Reform	Many USTDA activities have as a primary objective the facilitation of market-oriented reforms in developing countries. These reforms include encouraging more transparent regulatory systems and institutions, privatization of state-owned economic entities, promotion of greater competition in non-competitive economic sectors, lowering of non-tariff barriers to trade, strengthening of intellectual property rights and modernizing international trade systems and regulations.  
Human Capacity Building	When implemented, the Agency’s projects often create new job opportunities, sustain employment for those in jeopardy of losing jobs and/or offer advanced training to upgrade the capability of the work force.  USTDA considers a project to have Human Capacity Building impact if ten or more jobs are created and/or ten or more people receive significant training.
Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement	The Agency’s projects result in the introduction of advanced technologies (e.g. management information systems or process technologies) or licenses that improve processes and/or systems , resulting in greater economic productivity or more efficient use of resources.
Other	Other development benefits not captured by the above four categories - examples include enhanced government revenue, increased good governance or spin-off projects.






 
How Should the TOR of the FS/TA Address Development Impact?

The TOR should include a task that assesses the expected development benefits of the proposed project.  For example:

The FS/TA Contractor shall report on the potential Development Impact of the project in the host country.  In this section, the FS/TA Contractor should focus on what the economic development outcomes will be if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.    While specific focus should be paid to the immediate impact of the specific project that is being considered, the FS/TA contractor should include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits to the project, including spin-off and demonstration effects.  The analysis of potential benefits of the feasibility study contractor should be as concrete and detailed as possible.  The Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the host country.  The FS/TA contractor will provide estimates of the project’s potential benefits in the following areas: 

·	Infrastructure: a statement on the infrastructure impact giving a brief synopsis.  For example “This project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve x additional households in the region.”

·	Market-Oriented Reform: a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

·	Human Capacity Building:  The Contractor should address the number and type of positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of the training program.

·	Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement: a description of any advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that will be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%).

·	Other: any other developmental benefits to the project, including any spin-off or demonstration effects.

 
How Will This Affect the Final Report For the FS or TA?  

·	A section in the final report will be devoted to the projected host country Development Impact of the FS or TA recommendations if they are implemented.  The section should focus primarily on the key issues mentioned above (infrastructure and industrialization, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity, and market oriented reform).  Other host country development impacts (e.g. improved financial revenue flows to host government etc.) can be mentioned where appropriate.  The discussion should be as detailed and concrete as possible, and the contractor may provide estimates in ranges as appropriate.

Within five (5) working days after receiving the COTR’s comments on the draft report, the Contractor shall submit a revised copy for COTR review.  The Contractor shall revise the report as necessary until securing final COTR approval.  

5.3		FINAL REPORT – COTR APPROVAL

The final report shall incorporate all mutually agreed upon material and revisions.   The report shall include any supporting documentation.  It shall be grammatically and factually correct in all respects, internally consistent, and all statements and tables shall be clear and easily understood by a competent reader, and contain no typographical errors.  Upon notification from the COTR that the report is considered acceptable, the Contractor shall submit twenty (20) copies, and one (1) unbound original to USTDA.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

		USTDA has approved up to $35,000 for a Definitional Mission (DM) to China to review potential technical assistance, feasibility studies, and other activities related to environmental sector projects. The Contractor shall focus on potential projects related to air quality monitoring and emissions control, although other environmental sector projects could be considered.  The Contractor shall also focus on environmental sector projects in the northeastern section of the country (e.g., Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Liaoning, and Jilin provinces), although environmental sector projects in other areas could also be considered.

		China’s rapid industrialization in recent years, which is based in large part on a heavy reliance on coal for energy (as well as outdated technologies to reduce emissions), has led to increasing instances of environmental degradation.  A report by the World Health Organization noted that of the ten most polluted cities in the world, seven can be found in China.  Sulfur dioxide and soot caused by coal combustion are two major air pollutants, resulting in the formation of acid rain, which now falls on about 30% of China’s total land area.

Environmental damage is especially acute in the northeastern section of the country, which is home to a large concentration of power plants and factories that utilize coal as their main energy source.  In this part of the country, air pollution resulting from power plant emissions has been a particular problem.  The Chinese government, increasingly aware of the environmental problems in this part of the country, has emphasized the need for projects that would improve air quality in the region.   The World Bank and ADB have supported projects (particularly in Shandong province) to improve air quality in the region.

In addition, the region has also experienced significant degradation of its water supply.  The Contractor shall also examine a proposal submitted to USTDA related to improving water quality in the region.

<ARCHDATE>10172005
<CONTACT>Darlene Howes, 207-626-4559
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to request for clarifications. There is no change in the proposal due date. Further requests for clarifications must be submitted to the Contracting Office no later than close of business on Monday, 8 Augus t 2005. Requests for clarifications received after that date will be denied. 1.     Question: Voice Infrastructure: What type of Voice Telecommunications Customer Provided Equipment (CPE) is going to be used with the Voice Infrastructure Network?           Answer: We have a mix of voice telecommunications equipment from Nortel Meridian switches to Cisco VoIP enable routers. 2.   Questions: Is the Voice CPE existing, or is it going to be new?          Answer: Voice CPE is existing 3.	Question: Will JFHQ be deploying any components of Voice over IP (VOIP)? Answer:  JFWQ is currently deploying VoIP. 4.	Question:  Hardware Requirements.  Im looking for clarification here. Sections a,b &c lead me to believe that JFHQ wants the Provider to lease all the needed Cisco equipment to JFHQ. Section d & e lead me to believe that JFHQ is supplying all Cisco Lan  & edge equipment & only want the provider to provide services to the demarc (RJ48). Would appreicate advise as to whether  you want the chosen Provider to provide the solution to both the demarc (RJ48) as well as a solution including Cisco LAN & Edge devi ces. Answer: Clarification for Appendix  A Data Infrastructure, Hardware Requirements: Vendor will be responsible for supplying a solution to the Demarc (RJ48) but not any further.  If there is any requirement for hardware in between Demarcs that the vendor wou ld like to have JFHQ purchase , i.e. from Augusta Host Demarc to Remote Armory Demarc, than JFHQ is asking for a lease option as decribed in section a, b, c of the Hardware Requirements paragraph.
