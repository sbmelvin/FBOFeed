(i.e. Drywall, drop tile, etc.)  <br>    <br>  A2:  Acoustical Panels and building roofing with firewall material affixed to it.  <br>     <br>  Q3:  Are there any pictures available for the auditorium?  <br>    <br>  A3:  No, there are no pictures or drawings available.  <br>     <br>  Q4:  Is there a preferred speaker placement?
