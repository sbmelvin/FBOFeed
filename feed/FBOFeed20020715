<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intend to negotiate under FAR Part 13 - SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS PROCEDURES on sole source basis with the Center for Aging and HealthCare in West Virginia, 517 Market Street, 2nd Floor, Parkersburg, VA  26101 to conduct a rural analysis of the data from the demonstration of chronic disease self-management models for HRSA's Office of Rural Health Policy.  This acquisition is to support a rural analysis of the data from the demonstration of chronic disease self-management models.  The Office of Rural Health Policy has a mission to improve access and delivery of care to rural Americans. To assure the successful application of models for chronic disease self-management to rural America, it is essential to conduct an analysis to compare results for rural places to those for urban places.  The contractor shall conduct a quantitative analysis; analyze main and interactive intervention effects on the outcomes and conduct special analyses. The Center for Aging and HealthCare in West Virginia, Inc. is the sole organization with exclusive rights to the demonstration data.  Because the Center has an in-depth working knowledge of the data from the demonstration, the staffs possess specialized knowledgement of the scope and interrelationship of the variables for a rural analysis and they are the only organization that has analyzed the data for all geographic areas, both urban and rural areas and any other organization who attempts to do this type of work would have to replicate their previous accomplishments.  This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Therefore, the Center for Aging and HealthCare in West Virginia, Inc. is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S. C. 253 (c),(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (B) (1). 

This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification For Other Than Full and Open Competition is on file.  Written inquiries must reference Requisition number 02-OA-113.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for One (1) Inertial Measurement Unit and Pulse Code Modulation-based Telemetry System components consisting of airborne and ground elements. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Microbotics Inc. who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  They are the only company that can provide a telemetry system of components for the radio control operation of Remotely Piloted Vehicles. Microbotics previously built a custom telemetry system for NASA/LaRC as a testbed, which is the foundation for the work required.  Continuity and compatability are paramount for integrating the new system with the expanded requirements.  Microbotics has developed an unparalleled knowledge base of capabilities of the telemetry system that would take substantial time and money for another company to duplicate and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing (Phone Calls are not accepted)to Ms. Terry Cobb, NASA/LaRC, M/S 126, Hampton, VA 23681; fax number 757-864-6966, not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on July 30, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This synopsis is for informational purposes only.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to procure from Enterprise Integration Inc., 4031 University Dr Suite 200, Fairfax VA 22030, on an other than full and open competitive basis, Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) Software and Maintenance/Support consisting of the following:  five (5) ARIS EasyDesign for mySAP.com., one (1) ARIS Toolset for mySAP.com, one (1) ARIS Server,  one (1) ARIS Web Publisher, and associated ARIS Maintenance/Support.  The software is required in support of the Navy?s Integration & Coordination Board?s (ICB) effort to develop the business process architecture (BPA) supporting the Navy?s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) interoperability efforts.  In order to adequately represent the business-operating environment, the documentation software must be able to capture multiple process attributes (i.e. functional, organization, data, and output requirements).  In addition, since the SAP solution will enable an end-to-end business event, the software must provide the additional capability of integrating these attributes together into one seamless business process, with no additional manual effort required.  Providing the software documentation repository is a critical element of the BPA effort.  SAP uses the ARIS Toolset to create and maintain the business process repository within SAP.  ARIS also provides the required automated integration view, with complete end-to-end business event flow.  In addition, significant effort has been expended over the past 18 months modeling relevant business processed from other Navy ERP projects in ARIS; therefore, process comparisons to facilitate Navy interoperability can be leveraged and re-used.  The Government plans to procure the identified ARIS Software in support of tasking under GSA Schedule GS-35F-0557L with Enterprise Integration, Inc.  The performance period for this tasking is from 01 August 2002 through 15 November 2002 and the performance shall occur at NAVAIR Enterprise Solutions Program Office, Lexington Park MD.  Questions regarding this procurement can be referred to Katherine Lang, Contract Specialist, (301) 757-9716 or e-mail langkk@navair.navy.mil.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Tank-automotive Command (TACOM-WRN) is soliciting offers under Request for Proposal Number: DAAE07-02-R-L522 research and development for encapsulated ceramic tiles. General description of work to be performed:  One of the missions of TARDEC is to develop technologies for enhancing survivability of existing armored ground vehicles and future combat systems against future threats. The ongoing army transformation goals and objectives place a high demand on the use of light weight armor to meet t he weight requirements of the Future Combat System (FCS). Armor made of ceramic material is light in comparison to other armors. This effort is directed at developing technologies to reduce the weight of armor for FCS and still provide protection level tha t will defeat potential threats for the FCS. The effort will focus on the effect of lateral confinement pressure on the dwell time and depth of penetration in encapsulated ceramic from ballistic projectile impacts. It requires technical expertise in cerami c materials fabrication, armor design, mathematical formulations of confined ceramic tiles under ballistic loads, development of analysis tools, and hydrocode computer simulations of highly nonlinear phenomenon of the expanding comminuted tile material aft er fracture. This solicitation is competitive and will result in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with incremental funding.  Solicitation to be issued on or about 29 Jul 02 electronically on FedBizOpps at www.eps.gov.   Proposals due on or about 29 Aug 02. O nly electronic submissions will be accepted.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 7/31/2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.   Therefore, 3R Net, is the only responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S.C. 253(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  The anticipated period of performance is for thirty-six (36)
months.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.  This announcement is for information only.  NO solicitation is available.

MAINTAIN CHIMNEY SUPPORT QTRS 92

This acquisition is being offered for full and open competition subject to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 233210 as well as the Standard Industry Code (SIC) of 1521.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, Disabled Veteran Small Businesses, and HUBZone certified Businesses are encouraged to participate.  This project is located within the National Historic District at F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming.  The floors in historic quarters 92 slope downward towards the central chimney.  The apparent cause is that the central chimney settled more than the rest of the structure.  Prior attempts to rectify this situation have included, shimming of main support beams to the joists, supplemental foundations, and support framing systems.  It has been determined by a recent structural analysis that the structure has not stabilized.  This project entails installing an AB Chance drilled Helical Pier System, or equivalent, under the existing central chimney of an historic residence.  Access to the chimney foundation is a 5-foot high crawlspace.  The drilled piers will be torqued into the subgrade using minimum amount of torque as a criteria for the pier support.  Seven piers will be placed around the chimney foundation.  Each of these piers will support 12 Kips as a minimum.  The installation of the piers must allow for the chimney foundation to be "jacked" back to the residences original position.  The performance period for the resultant construction contract award as a result of this solicitation is fourteen (14) calendar days from issuance of a Notice to Proceed.  Magnitude of this project is less than $25,000 and the Government has a budget of $20,000.  Issue date for this solicitation is anticipated to be on or before 19 July 2002, with a closing date 30 calendar days after issuance.  A site visit will be conduct 12 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) - lowest price.

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from  Cadence Design Systems, Inc, 2655 Seely Avenue in San Jose, CA 95134 only.  These  (CAE) tools are used to facilitate the design of very high density integrated circuit components are being developed for high performance ground and space based systems.  these tools directly support the ongoing efforts of the microelectronics and signal processing branch (Code 564) to design, develop and test advanced ground systems.  The CAE tools from Cadence are required to continue the evolution of current in-house VLSI design methodologies to a higher level of design abstraction in order to promote higher design productivity and design reuse.  An increase in productivity is required to design the next generation very complex, very dense integrated systems without significant increasing staffing levels.  Having software support will aid in this endeavor and augment the current GSFC-owned CAE tools with a net effect of accelerating integrated circuit test development and allowing designers more access to high level CAE tools.  Since these CAE tools are proprietary to Cadence Design Systems, Inc., this is the only vendor that can provide software support for these CAE tools.

<DESC>BEST TERMS FROM A COST OR PRICE AND TECHNICAL STANDPOINT.  The Government reserves the right to award only one contract covering the project identified in the RFP if the minimum guarantee of funds is not available for three or more awards.  This is an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written Task Orders to the Contractor.  Award of Task Orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for Commercial and Institutional Buildings.  Work will consist of construction, design build for new construction, renovation, alteration and repair and associated work at various locations within Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Washington and Alaska.  However it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in California.  Type of work/projects may include, but are not limited to: administration buildings, hospital and medical buildings, auditoriums, fire stations, garages, office buildings, hangars, laboratories, and parking structures.  The NASIC Code is 23332.  The annual size standard is $27.5 million.  Individual Task Orders/Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed on individual task orders to satisfy a variety of NASIC 23332 projects projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  Architectural/Engineering (A/E) firms their subsidiaries and affiliates that were involved at the RFP or design stage of a project may not be proposed or used on the relative project.  The Contractor's architect/engineering team shall accomplish all discipline coordination.  The Government shall not coordinate the work for the contractor.  Projects assigned to the IDIQ contract(s) use the Solution Order Concepts approach to scope and price the work.  After award of the initial contract(s), each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505 (b)(2).  Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order and may be competed on the basis of price, best value or technically acceptable, low-price selection procedures.  The subsequent task orders may be performance oriented tasks requiring minimal design, may occasionally be complex construction requiring design development for design-build construction or a combination of both.  They will be scoped by the Government/Contractor Team and may not have traditional plans and specifications but may include sketches, and requests for catalog cuts, and other submittals.  The salient requirements of the task order will be scoped by the Government/Contractor Team, in order to develop a mutually agreed upon Statement of Work.  The awarded task order will be performance scoped, firm fixed price task with a specific completion date.  Should any of the IDIQ Contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded a task order.  If a contracts list will not be faxed.  IT IS THE OFFEROR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE DAILY FOR ANY AND ALL AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.  The response time set by FAR 5.203 will begin on the date of issuance of the solicitation.  Note:  Joint venture offerors shall submit their joint venture agreement with their proposal.  Offerors participating in teaming/partnership agreements for this procurement shall submit their teaming/partnership agreements with their proposal.  Each agreement shall demonstrate the relationship between firms and identify contractual relationships and authorities to bind the firm/joint venture/team/partnership.  The joint venture or teaming/partnership agreements will not be rated.  However, they will be utilized as a reference tool in determining the validity of and or risk associated with this or any other factor in the offeror's proposal.  The agreement will not count in the page limitation.  Additionally, the name of each entity within a joint venture/teaming arrangement or partnership shall be shown in Block 14 of the Standard Form 1442 submitted with the proposal.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Craft-Tech (Combustion Flow and Research), 174 North Main Street, Building 3, P.O. Box 1150, Dublin, PA 18917. Craft-Tech is the only known qualified source to perform this effort.  AFRL/MNAC requires modification to the proprietary Craft-AD CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) Code.  This code was developed specifically for AFRL/MNAC to handle calculations relating to chemical and biological agents. These modifications are to model blast events directly in the Craft-AD code as the means of initializing CFD calculations for Counter Proliferation Studies.  The algorithms to be added include an Equation of Sate for the explosive, and models/algorithms for the high-resolution calculation of the detonation of the explosive such that the resulting blast waves are obtained correctly.  The modifications are to be integrated into the existing physics and code framework of the Craft-AD source code.  Also, modification to the input deck structure of the Craft-AD CFD code will need to be performed.  This work requires having the source code to the Craft-AD code.  Craft-Tech is uniquely capable of performing this task through direct experience with the Craft-AD CFD code developed under the Modeling and Data Acquisition Research program, a Phase II SBIR (contract F08630-99-C-0003).  Currently, AFRL/MNAC believes that only Craft-Tech has the source code to their Craft-AD code.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Craft-Tech sole source.  However, all responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  Technical inquiries may be addressed to Dr. Kirk Vanden, email kirk.vanden@eglin.af.mil or phone 872-3124 x 3350.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist identified herein.  For any other concerns, interested parties may email the AFRL/MN Ombudsman, Lt Col Mary T. Quinn, at mary.quinn@eglin.af.mil or fax (850) 882-9599.  See Note 22.

<DESC>In preparation for the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau conducts a series of tests.  In early 2003, Census plans to test various modes of responding to the census.  The 2003 Census Test includes mail, IVR and Internet as optional modes for completion of the census short form.  Census shall contract for the design, development, testing and implementation of an IVR and Internet census short form for the 2003 Census Test.  Census request a separate, smaller effort to design, develop, test and implement an outbound IVR reminder call to non-responding residents.  The results of the 2003 Census Test feed directly into planning for the larger 2004 Census Test.  The results of the 2003 Census Test provide feedback for recommending what options we offer respondents during the 2004 Census Test.  Additionally, the results of the 2003 Census Test provide guidance for the recommended timing of offering various options.  The Census Bureau plans to award a sole source purchase order to Dr. Kent Norman, 7 Thomas Drive, Silver Spring MD to provide advice and guidance to the Bureau of the Census IVR and web design teams to (1) ensure requirements are complete, (2) review prime contractor progress, (3) participate in formal testing, and (4) review results and evaluations.  The support contractor shall assist with making recommendations for Census response option strategies for 2004 and beyond.  The support contractor's guidance shall be based on interviews, analysis and application of similar web survey instruments and procedures based on human-computer interaction, interface design and research on self-administered questionnaires and computer assisted interviewing.  The contractor will assist the Bureau of the Census in determining the most effective designs based on the type and nature of census data and the latest technologies available.  Knowledge of census form design, data collection processes and post-processing activities are essential. Dr. Norman has previously conducted work for the Bureau of the Census in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Maryland and has an appreciation for the data-intense Census environment.  Dr. Norman's expertise and leadership is demonstrated by peer-reviewed publications and seminar presentations.  Period of performance is through September 30, 2003.  The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive quotations; no solicitation will be issued.

<ARCHDATE>08302002
<CONTACT>Robert Mohn, Contracting Officer, 412-386-4963, mohn@netl.doe.gov;Robert Mohn, Contract Specialist, 412-386-4963, mohn@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>SUBJECT: FUEL CELL POWER UNITS DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy"s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Morgantown, WV site intends to award a fixed priced purchase order to Fuel Cell Technologies Ltd., 20 Binnington Court, Kingston, ON Canada to purchase the following: 1.  Introductions: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a need for 3-5 kW fuel cell power units that can provide electricity for instrumentation and communications gear positioned at abandoned hardrock mines for the purpose of environmental monitoring.  These mines are in remote locations, and are typically visited by EPA technical personnel 2-3 time/year. Winter weather conditions may prevent access to these mines for a period of up to 6 months.  Power sources that are presently being used are limited by the expense of the power, low power density, unattended operating life, sensitivity to climate (especially cold temperatures), and reliability, as well as compatibility with mine environments.  The technical requirements for this application are somewhat representative of portable power units used in a broad variety of market applications (e.g., camping, military, etc.).  The U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) will procure a single 3-5 kW fuel cell system that meets the requirements described in the following sections.  The NETL will then conduct performance tests of the power unit in Morgantown, WV, publish the results, and, upon validation of the requirements, deliver the unit to the EPA. 2.  General Requirements: The power unit should be suitably designed for use at remote hard rock mines sites in Montana.  Since these mine sites are officially designated as abandoned, there are no specific requirements regarding Mine Safety Standards per se.  However, the unit is expected to follow NFPA and IEEE safety standards for the design and operation of general-purpose power units. Of equal importance is the general environmental performance of the unit. The proposed unit should provide equal or better environmental performance than competing technologies currently on the market; e.g., diesel and gas generators.  The evaluation of this factor includes both criteria pollutant emissions as well as net fuel efficiency.  The proposer is required to include references to available competing technology and show the magnitude of improvement their unit offers in pollutant emissions rates. 3.  Detailed requirements: 3.1.  The power unit shall be complete package with a fuel cell, reformer, inverter, etc., such that the input will be fuel and the output will be grounded split-phase 120/240 VAC, 60 Hz electrical power. 3.2.  The power unit shall be able to start-up and operate in a remote location where no utilities (natural gas, electric, phone, city water, etc) are available. 3.3.  The power unit shall be easily transportable by truck (over rough road) to the remote location.  If the system consists of numerous individual sub-systems, multiple trips to deliver the complete unit are acceptable. 3.4.  Maximum electrical output is 3-5 kW continuous, 10 kW peak for 5 seconds (during startup of motors); a storage device (e.g., batteries) may be used for load-buffering. 3.5.  The system should be able to be operated in an idle state (zero loading) for up to several days. 3.6.  All equipment within the power unit shall be capable of running unattended continuously (24 hours/day 7 days/week) for 6 months without maintenance or breakdown.  The system shall be capable of operating at least 40,000 hours with routine maintenance when subjected to normal use. 3.7.  Fuel efficiency over a variable loading is critical for this application given the extended, remote unattended operation of this unit. 3.8.  The power unit shall be able to be started, operated and monitored remotely (using standard digital and analog inputs/outposts for communication), with appropriate remotely monitored status indication provided to indicate malfunction of the power unit. 3.9.  The power unit must be capable of automatic self-diagnosis and re-set. 3.10.  Digital and analog communication signal lines must be included for indication and control as follows: 3.10.1 - Fuel level indications. 3.10.2 - Safety/operational status indication. 3.10.3 - Remote control request for startup and shut down. 3.11.  The power unit shall be suitable for outdoor installation in and around mine applications and able to operate at elevations of 5,000 to 7,000 feet in ambient temperatures between  -52 F  (-47 C) and 100 F (38 C).  The unit may be placed within a protective heated enclosure, if necessary.  If such an enclosure is required, the technical requirements of such an enclosure should be included as part of a quotation in his  bid or quote. 3.12.  The power unit shall be capable of safe, routine operation in and around a hard rock mine by non-technical personnel. 3.13.  The total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output voltage shall be less than 5% when supplying power to a non-linear load of two computer power supplies over any range of output. 3.14.  Output voltage tolerance shall be no more than +/-6%, and frequency shall be 60 Hz -/-0.1 Hz, from no-load to full-load conditions., 3.15.  Able to meet FCC Class A-industrial requirements for conducted and radiated EMI. 3.16.  Self-protection against output short circuit, over current, over temperature, over voltage, and under voltage or loss of input fuel shall be provided to prevent damaging the power unit. 3.17.  If submitting a quotation it must be accompanied by the following additional information: 3.17.1 - Statement regarding acceptable fuels for use. 3.17.2 - Statement regarding fuel-to-electric efficiency for each fuel under specified nominal full power, 1/2 power, and 1/4 power operating conditions. 3.17.3 - Statement regarding the system acoustic noise. 3.17.4 - Statement regarding the system lifetime when operated at specified nominal operating conditions. 3.17.5 - Statement regarding maximum permissible maintenance intervals. 3.17.6 - Statement regarding lowest survivable (non-operating) temperature. 3.17.7 - Statement regarding lowest ambient temperature for startup. 3.17.8 - Statement regarding the length of time for startup. 4.  Deliverables: 4.1.  A complete power unit built to the specifications listed in sections 2.0 and 3.0. 4.2.  Three (3) copies of operation and maintenance manuals (specify maintenance intervals) for the power unit. 5.  Delivery: The vendor is responsible for shipment of all deliverables to: DOE/NETL Building 19 3610 Collins Ferry Road Morgantown, WV 26505. This purchase order is being issued to Fuel Cell Technologies Ltd., because this vendor is uniquely qualified to provide such a unit since Fuel Cell Technologies Ltd (FCT) has a unique relationship established with EPRI. FCT will be able to provide to the government a low cost power system, through leveraging of appropriated funds.  Time is important since the EPA desires that testing at NETL occur in "winter time" conditions.  To meet these conditions, it is important that a purchase order be placed as soon as possible given the lead time necessary to provide a unit that meets the government requirements and initiate testing during the coming winter which FCT is able to do.  A previous attempt was made to acquire such a power unit and was published in FEDBIZOPS for sources sought by no quotes were received by NETL except from FCT. This request is considered to be sole source to Fuel Cell Technologies LTD. Therefor, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  This award shall be made using simplified acquisition procedures.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770.  The Technical Representative for the above purchase is Mr. Randall Gemmen, phone (304) 285-4536

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate with LifePlans, Inc., Two University Office Park, Suite 304, 51 Sawyer Road, Waltham, MA 02154, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302.1.  The purpose of this contract would be to obtain expertise to assist the DHHS Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in conducting a study of the attitudes and preferences of members of the federal workforce (active workers, annuitants, spouses and parents) related to the first offering of private group long term care insurance.  The Contractor must: have access to survey and insurance policy information collected by Long Term Care Partners related to this offering, have a thorough knowledge of previous research on buyers and non-buyers of both group and individual long-term care insurance and be capable of preparing the data and conducting the analysis.  A major requirement of this acquisition is that the contractor possesses considerable background in research on private long-term care insurance so that the study can be completed in time to provide information relevant to government policymaking.  LifePlans, Inc. alone has access to this proprietary data set and has the research experience necessary to conduct this study.  Any other contractor would have to; 1) have access to the data collected by Long Term Care Partners, 2) have the data system capabilities for cleaning and analyzing the data, 3) acquire specialized knowledge of the previous buyer and non-buyer research related to the purchase of long-term care insurance.  Therefore, the government believes that to award this contract to any other contractor but LifePlans would result in a significant increase in cost and even then would not assure access to the data, or the expertise necessary to conduct the study.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a cost estimate and statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirements as described above.  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above. See Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to purchase the following four items on a sole source basis from Y2 Ultra-Filter California, Inc., 1201 Via La Jolla, San Clemente, CA 92672:  One PMS Lasair 101, an eight-channel particle counter, two PMS Lasair 510s, which are seven-channel particle counters, and one TSI 3400A, a fluidized bed aerosol generator for the Chemical/Biological Systems Division, NSWCDD.  A sole source procurement is necessary because this equipment has already been tested and validated for evaluation of electrically-enhanced filters in an integrated test setup.  This equipment is surplus hardware from Y2 Ultra-Filter Inc., and is able to interface and communicate with existing hardware and computer programs.  The purchase of similar test equipment from alternate suppliers would entail time-consuming and expensive validation testing.  In thes e tests the equipment would have to be transferred between three different laboratories across the United States for round-robin validation testing.  This round-robin testing would require excessive and costly redundant tests, and would also risk exposing the delicate test equipment to damage in multiple shipping stages. The equipment to be purchased, however, has already undergone the round-robin validation tests for electrically-enhanced filters. Award is to be made under simplified acquisition procedures on an all or none basis.  The closing date is 29 July 2002.  Anticipated award date is 31 July 2002.  Delivery is required by 26 August 2002.  Pricing should be FOB Destination to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA  22448-5100.  THE GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT ISSUE A WRITTEN REQUEST FOR QUOTATION AS ALL ITEMS ARE IDENTIFIED IN  THIS COMMERCE BUSINESS DAILY (CBD) NOTICE.  The Government will award a purchase order from this combined synopsis/solicitation to Y2 Ultra-Filter California, Inc.  All responsible sources may submit their quote by e-mail in Microsoft Word format to sd13@nswc.navy.mil.  E-mail should reference N00178-02-Q-3025.

<DESC>Statement of Purpose NASA seeks an unfunded collaboration with a commercial or non-profit organization to define, organize and execute a nationwide contest for K-12  students in U.S. schools to select names for the two robotic Mars rovers  launching in 2003.  In some cases where there is significant private investment, provision of value-added public benefits and value to NASA,  the Agency may contemplate limited exclusive offers, under certain conditions, such as:     ·	Official designation  ·	Association with NASA This request for entrepreneurial offer outlines the minimum requirement  for such a contest.  NASA is interested in receiving from U.S. companies, academic institutions or non-profit organizations any creative  recommendations to accomplishing these minimums and/or any additional  ideas that may result in increased public involvement in NASA's  exploration of Mars.  It is intended that this request for entrepreneurial  offer will result in the establishment of a non-reimbursable Space Act  Agreement that will define the full roles and responsibilities of NASA and  the proposing organization (for information on Space Act Agreements, please  see http://www.hq.nasa.gov/ogc/samanual.html). Mission Background The rovers, equipped with cameras and other scientific instruments, are central to NASA's Mars Exploration Rover-2003 (MER-2003) mission, which  seeks clues to the history of water on Mars.  Launching in May/June and  June/July 2003, the rovers will land on Mars in January/February 2004.   The rovers are part of a single mission, yet each rover will have a mission  of its own.  Each rover will be launched on a separate launch vehicle and  will have a separate space flight and landing area. The mission calls for  each rover to operate on the surface of Mars for three months, utilizing  identical suites of science instruments to conduct similar investigations in different regions of the planet.   The mission is managed by the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of the California Institute of Technology,  Pasadena, CA, where the rovers are being built. JPL also will be home to  the rover mission operations and data return. Project Background: "Name the Rovers" Competition Names for NASA missions, spacecraft, landers,  and rovers ultimately will be selected by the responsible program managers at NASA Headquarters,  Washington, D.C.  Submissions of candidate names, however, may be gathered through a variety of methods, including contests that invite participation by K-12 students.  By focusing the Mars Exploration Rover-2003 "Name the Rovers" contest on K-12 entries, NASA seeks to engage U.S. students in the engineering and scientific enterprise behind Mars exploration in furtherance of national goals to stimulate interest in science, mathematics and technology education. NASA views such contests as opportunities that further the Agency objectives to inform the public and distribute knowledge gained  from the space program to a broad audience.  To support these objectives,  NASA has determined that all suggestions for potential names for the two  MER-2003 rovers will be gathered through a "Name the Rovers" competition  with broad K-12 student participation. For the 1997 Mars Pathfinder mission, a contest was conducted by a  non-profit scientific organization inviting U.S. students to submit names  with accompanying essays. Approximately 93,000 entries were received for the Mars Pathfinder rover.  The winning entry, "Sojourner," in honor of  abolitionist Sojourner Truth, was submitted by a middle-school student who received national recognition for her contribution.  She also received an all-expenses-paid trip (provided by the sponsoring organization) to Cape  Canaveral, Florida, for the launch of the Pathfinder mission.  Because such contests draw considerable public interest, the process of  registering, sorting, evaluating and judging entries is labor-intensive and  requires careful consideration of entries and feedback to entrants.  At the  same time, such contests present excellent opportunities to engage the  interest of young Americans in space science and exploration, its  objectives, and the advances it produces in science, math, engineering and  technology and knowledge in general.   Scope  This request will be open through three weeks following date of release of  this announcement.  All proposals must be received by August 1, 2002, to be  considered.  The successful offeror will agree to conduct a contest during  the 2002 fall-winter semester to evaluate, select and deliver to JPL by Feb. 15, 2003, the top 25 names that have been proposed and the associated  nomination essays submitted by the students. JPL will recommend a subset of  the 10 names to NASA Headquarters by March 30, 2003.  NASA Headquarters will make final selections prior to the launch of the rovers in May and June  2003. Benefits to a Corporate Partner In exchange for the creation and facilitation of the naming contest, NASA  may consider negotiating limited exclusivity and other opportunities as part of a strategic collaboration.  Consideration may be made for those offers  that are commensurate and reflect NASA mission, values and goals.  The selected offeror would have an opportunity to be part of a historic  mission, one that helps NASA reach its mission and outreach goals. Secondly, the selected offeror would have the appropriate level of acknowledgement as  a partner with NASA, commensurate with the offeror's added value return to  the Agency.   The Mars Pathfinder project attracted extraordinary public awareness and  interest, on an international level.  During the course of the project there was extensive coverage through virtually all media outlets, over one billion hits were observed on project Web sites, and the project received extensive  attention in multiple public forums (including academic, Congressional and  industry communities).  It is our expectation that the MER-2003 project will receive even more attention.  This offers intrinsic value to potential  project partners. Deliverables:   Deliverables include, but are not limited to:  -	Monthly reports from September through December 2002 on:  o	The number of schools, children's organizations and students reached directly and indirectly through the proposed advertising strategies;  o	Number of respondents from each school/city/state at each grade level;  o	Post-selection plan for making any awards or prizes.   -	A January 2003 report that includes:  o	The top 25 nominations and rationale for their selection;   o	Final data on contest participation;  o	Advertising and/or educational programs associated with the winners or  winning submissions.  -	The contest organizer will preserve relevant data on the numbers of  entries received, the most commonly suggested names, the most unique names,  and the locations in the U.S. or its territories from which entries are  received.  All submitted nomination essays become the property of NASA.  -	Weekly status teleconference Term of Agreement The Space Act Agreement will be in effect from the time of selection  through completion of proposed activities, or no later than the landing of  the second rover, which is scheduled for February 2004.  There are no  options for renewal. Instructions for Proposal Preparation Offerors' proposals will be judged on their educational value and the  expected breadth and depth of penetration into the national K-12 student  population via the mass media and traditional channels into the classroom.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to develop the plan in coordination with a  nationally recognized education association or similar professional educator network of the offeror's choosing.  A key goal of this effort is to inspire American youth in science, math, engineering and technology learning;  creative collaborations between commercial and non-profit educational  organizations in furtherance of this objective are encouraged. The  successful proposal will include: -	A plan to launch and manage a contest inviting K-12 students  nationwide to submit, at no charge, names for one or both of the two Mars  Exploration Mission rovers (currently known as MER A and MER B).  Student-written essays of 500 or fewer words will explain the nomination.  Submissions from students will be invited in the fall of the 2002 school year, and will be accepted through the end of December 2002.  Both electronic mail and paper mail delivery (including submission by compact disc) will be  accepted as means of submission. Proposals must include the process for handling electronic submissions. -	A description of roles and responsibilities of contest coordinators, and the management structure of the implementation team.   -	A description of how the contest will be conducted, including how  entries from widely varying age groups will be judged based on  grade-appropriate evaluations.  In addition, it should include how the  contest will be widely advertised, how it will be evaluated and by whom,  qualifications of contest judges, how duplicate entries (same name proposed  by multiple entrants) will be judged, and what recognition, benefits  and/or prizes all entrants shall receive.  The offeror also must describe  how personal information, submitted by the essay authors, will be protected  (most, if not all, of the authors will be minors) and any proposed,  additional use of that information.   -	A schedule of key events in the process. -    Description of the educational plan for the contest and how it will  reinforce student learning. -    Description of additional activities to increase public involvement  in NASA exploration of Mars. Threshold Requirements All proposals must comply with the following to be considered:  ·	Demonstrable ability to design, conduct and manage this competition  under the parameters described.  ·	Organization and its proposal are consistent with NASA mission,  objectives and values.  ·	No requirement of personal endorsement or personnel participation in advertising or marketing by NASA officials or employees.  ·	Compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1972, the  Child Online Privacy Protection Act and any other applicable Federal laws. Evaluation and Award Process Evaluation Criteria   The five evaluation criteria listed below are in a descending order of  importance.  The government will make award for the proposal that is most  advantageous to the government based on these five factors. 1.	Educational benefits associated with participation in the "Name  the Rovers" competition.  2.	Breadth and depth of penetration into the K-12 student population by the proposed activity (e.g. awareness of, and access to, the "Name the  Rovers" competition by all geographic and socio-economic segments).  3.	Demonstrated ability to design, construct, and manage the "Name the  Rovers" competition under the guidelines stated in this solicitation, and  the efficiency and effectiveness of the review and recommendation process. Include documented ability to accept, review, store, summarize and deliver  the received nomination essays and associated summary and demographic  statistics (e.g. distribution of submissions by geographic, economic  (urban, rural, etc.) and educational region, grade-level participation).   4.	Additional value and benefits to NASA. 5.	Ease and availability of the nomination process to participating  students. General Conditions Offerors must understand that NASA, as a taxpayer-funded Agency, must  make its information available to the broadest possible audience. While  some limited exclusivity may be possible, proposals that would severely  restrict participation in the competition will be unacceptable. Special Agreement Conditions Following NASA's guidelines, names of current or proposed space missions  cannot be used, and if a rover is to be named after a person, that person  must be deceased with no post mortem right of publicity.  The rovers cannot be called by names already adopted by any previous, present or planned  astronomical observatory (domestic or international).  Names may not include terms reserved for ongoing NASA flight programs (e.g., Explorer, Discovery, Navigator). A trademark search shall be performed before a final selection  of a name is made to uncover any possible trademarks that could cause  confusion.  Further information on official names for major NASA projects  may be found at the following Web site: http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/library/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PD_7620_001 G_&page_name=main The naming contest must be open to all students who, in the fall of 2002,  will be in grades K-12 in the U.S. (including U.S. possessions and schools  operated by the U.S. for the children of American personnel overseas),  except employees directly affiliated with NASA, JPL, the California  Institute of Technology, the offeror's organizations/companies, and their immediate families. Any Web sites created in conjunction with this project must be fully  accessible to the disabled, according to the 1998 amendment of Section 508  of the Rehabilitation Act of 1972, and comply with the Child Online Privacy  Protection Act and any other applicable federal laws.

<DESC>FINAL UPDATE:  The purpose of this synopsis is to advise industry for planning and or/preparation purposes of an OMB Circular A-76 Direct Conversion for the Administration of Personnel Data Systems in the Air Force Special Operations Command located at Hurlburt Field FL.   A FINAL DRAFT copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is available on the Federal Government?s Electronic Posting System (www.fedbizopps.gov).    It is emphasized that this SOW is merely a DRAFT and various changes may be included in the final SOW once the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) is released.  The Contracting office anticipates issuing a RFP using FAR Parts 12 and 15 for a one-year basic period (includes a two-month transition period) with four (4) one-year option periods.  NAICS Code 541513 is applicable to this effort.   The small business size standard is $18,000,000.  The contract type will be Firm-Fixed Price.  This requirement will be 100% set-aside for small business participation (THIS IS A CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS POSTING). The anticipated issue date is on or about 15 August 2002 (THIS IS A CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS POSTING).  Relevant information regarding a site visit or conference will be announced in a future FedBizOpps posting.  This announcement is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract at this time.  However, the Government believes industry feedback is important and is receptive to any and all comments or questions from industry that would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.  Request that interested parties review the DRAFT SOW and QASP and take this opportunity to submit any comments on the overall content and their relationship to standard commercial practices for this type of operation.   All comments shall be forwarded to 16CONS/LGCY, 350 Tully Street, Hurlburt Field, FL 32544; or via email to Cathina Hill.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business against the above size standard.  This is a paperless acquisition.  Paper copies of the solicitation will NOT be issued.   A government cost estimate is being developed and a contract may or may not result.

We anticipate our presentation to take approximately the first 3-hours, leaving the remainder of the day for discussions and questions.  In addition, we have established a location on the Austin Automation Website for this acquisition and we will post our briefing charts No Later Than 31 July 2002 to provide you a "read ahead."

Attendance is not mandatory to participate in any subsequent solicitation for this requirement but it is important for several reasons.  First, we will be providing more specific insights to the genesis, goals, approaches and rough schedule of the proposed acquisition.  Second, this will be an opportunity for you to provide feedback and have a positive impact on the acquisition process.  Finally, the conference will allow an opportunity for you to network with other firm's representatives for possible teaming partners/subcontract arrangements.  This may be especially important given that our approach is to pursue omnibus contract(s) that cover the entire spectrum of IT services.  We welcome your suggestions for additions or changes to our agenda for the presentation and we will do our best to accommodate your inputs.  We also suggest that you forward your questions via email in advance so that we can research and improve the quality of the response at the conference.

<DESC>NA MODIFICATION -- This requirement, which was posted 22 January 2002, modified 21 February 2002, and reposted Jun 26 2002, has been reconfigured.  This notice supercedes previous notices for a competitive award in September, 2002.  The reconfigured requireme nt is less focussed upon the Test Support Network (TSN) and includes a narrower range of requirements.  The requirement is for non-personal services, including inside and outside communication plant installation of the Test Support Network (TSN) at White S ands Missile Range, New Mexico, and system support services.  The TSN is a fiber optic data transmission and communication system.  Installation tasks include current and future equipment installations, fiber optic and copper cable installations, interface s, and integration into test facility instrumentation.  System support includes maintenance and repair of the installed system.  (Engineering support, cable splicing and procurement requirements are no longer included.)  The requirement is not restricted t o the TSN Program. The fiber optic data transmission and communication system at White Sands may be expanded within and without the TSN Program to other test facilities in the western United States.  However, these expansions are not named, programmed or f unded at this point.  The Government will award a firm-fixed price, task order contract for the services.  Individual tasks will be assigned by bilateral modification of the contract. Funding is budgeted at less than $1 million in the first year, and is un certain thereafter.  However, subject to certain technical contingencies, it is estimated the contract may total $5 million if it goes to completion.  Tasks will be assigned based upon priority of need as funding becomes available.  This requirement is a 1 00% set-aside for Small Businesses.  The applicable NAICS code is 541512, Computer Systems Design Services.  The small business size standard is $21.0 million average annual receipts for the last three fiscal years.  The period of performance will be a bas e period of one year, with four one-year option periods.  The solicitation will be posted on the RMAC, White Sands Division web cite http://www.wsmr.army.mil/docpage/docpage.htm Thursday, 18 July 2002, and will close Thursday, 8 August 2002.  See Note 1.

Since its formation in 1990, the Alliance has been the preeminent policy and educational organization advocating for workable primary prevention solutions to lead poisoning.  The AECLP is uniquely qualified to develop Building Blocks for Primary Prevention in Public Health because it is the only organization with the skills, experience, and interdisciplinary reach across the policy, program, technical, and regulatory aspects of the health, housing, and environmental dimensions of lead poisoning prevention.  The AECLP championed the national shift to prevention by helping craft Title X, the landmark 1992 federal lead poisoning prevention law.  Its staff and board members chaired the Title X Task Force and its three major committees, which crafted the original vision for making the housing stock lead-safe.  With the help of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), the AECLP developed a model state law for lead poisoning prevention to translate the vision of the Task Force into legislative language.  Since that time, the AECLP has closely followed and influenced the development of every federal program, standard, regulation, and guideline related to lead poisoning prevention.  Among other things, the AECLP has helped lead the national approach towards mainstreaming the knowledge, tools, and strategies of lead poisoning prevention, including building capacity for lead-safe work practices among painters and remodelers and expanding capacity for clearance dust testing.  Over the past decade, the AECLP has established excellent working relationships with directors and staff of scores of state and local health departments, who frequently call on the AECLP for assistance and advice.  These relationships are mandatory for the identification of promising and innovative strategies.  In addition, the Alliance anchors the national network of more than 300 grassroots organizations committed to lead poisoning prevention and it maintains close working relationships with many of these groups.  The AECLP, with Vanguard Communications, directed the Campaign for Lead-Safe America, the national education campaign that helped raise awareness and delivered targeted information about lead safety strategies to parents, trades people, and landlords.  The AECLP keeps the larger lead poisoning prevention community apprised of important developments through its bi-monthly Alliance Alert newsletter and maintains the two most widely used listservs, L-S America and LeadNet, through which practitioners can compare notes across the country.  The AECLP web site, www.aeclp.org, provides a source of accurate and relevant information to parents, practitioners, and policy makers on many aspects of lead poisoning prevention, with an average of 8,000 visitors each month.  Each of these electronic communications networks are important to identifying innovative strategies and spreading the word about Building Blocks for Primary Prevention in Public Health.  Over the past decade, AECLP staff have done cutting-edge work and published resource documents on the constellation of issues and strategies that impact on lead poisoning prevention.  As the only organization with conversance in and command of all these strategies, the Alliance is uniquely qualified to tackle the assignment of crafting Building Blocks for Primary Prevention in Public Health.  The contract period of performance will two years from the contract award date.  The intended contract is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 U.S.C.  253 (c)(1).  AECLP is believed to be the only entity with ready access to the best technical advice available about the effectiveness of a range of strategies for evaluating and controlling lead hazards in housing through the National Center for Healthy Housing.  The Government knows of only one qualified source capable of providing the required services.  This is not a request for proposals.  Interested parties shall submit in writing; their name, address, point of contact, and telephone number.  Interested parties shall also submit a brief capability statement indicating their capabilities to perform this service.  This information shall be submitted in writing, or faxed to (770) 488-2671, or E-Mailed to BAS4@CDC.GOV.  Attn: Barry E. Smith.  Interested parties that fail to provide the required information within 15 calendar days from date of the publication of this announcement will be considered not responsive to this announcement and no information will be provided.  All responsible sources that meet the above requirements may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  See numbered note 26.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is seeking expressions of interest of responsible and interested sources and offerors with GSA contracts that are experienced in the deployment of rapid, low cost enterprise solutions that yield efficiency savings quickly with minimal life cycle support costs and performance guarantees by the integrator.  The NAVSEA goal is to have a Navy owned implementation that pays itself off within the same year it is implemented.  Based on the results of this Sources Sought Synopsis, NAVSEA intends to issue a Request For Quote (RFQ) (planned for late July) for the conduct of a Business Case Analyses (BCA) of an enterprise system implementation to a limited number of selected respondents to the Sources Sought Synopsis.   Over the next few years, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Headquarters (HQ) and Program Executive Offices (PEOs ) will need to reduce expenditures in its headquarters operations.  NAVSEA needs to save money in the core business processes of financial management, human resources and project management.  Enterprise IT solutions are widely considered as key enablers toward transforming an organization toward more efficient operations.  NAVSEA has developed internal cost, schedule and benefits realization estimates based on the work developed for the other Navy programs, especially the NAVAIR SIGMA Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and the NAVSEA Fleet ERP - NEMAIS.  NAVSEA needs an enterprise solution that can be implemented quickly, inexpensively and yet deliver benefits rapidly.   This Sources Sought Synopsis is intended to provide the command a list of companies who are interested and capable of addressing our business objectives with an enterprise system. NAVSEA will send RFQs to sele ct responsible and interested parties based on their response to the Sources Sought.  NAVSEA intends to make multiple (3-5) awards of contracts for the conduct of a BCA in the August timeframe, based on responses to the RFQ   Multiple awards are intended to provide different viewpoints on potential costs and solutions.  NAVSEA has approximately $350K available for completion of all BCA contracts awarded.    These BCA contract(s) would develop concept, cost, benefit realization, schedule and integrator guarantees of a NAVSEA enterprise systems for financial, human resources and project management.  Each BCA award is intended to cover all five of these areas.  Contractors will be encouraged to use their own format and process in the BCA.  The BCA contract(s) will be of short duration, with a period of performance of not greater than six weeks.  The BCA(s) will assist NAVSEA in  evaluating our planned approach, internal estimates, and in reassessing our business goals.  The enterprise solution system is intended for use in NAVSEA HQ and PEOs.  If an ERP is the best solution from a Business Case perspective and if it is funded, it would become part of the DoN ERP plan. Participation in the Sources Sought Synopsis is required in order to be considered for a BCA contract(s).  Participation in the Sources Sought Synopsis or BCA contract(s) is not required for participation in a future solicitation for an enterprise solution for headquarters operations.  Results from the BCA studies will be made available to all potential competitors in the event of a future competition for a corporate ERP integration effort.   	Interested parties having the required specialized capabilities to meet all of the above proposed requirements should submit to Ms.  Lynell M. Fo x (SEA 02662) a typed expression of interest/capability statement indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the efforts described above.

<DESC>DESC: New sources sought: During the calendar quarter ending
  JUN 2002, the Defense Information Technology Contracting
  Organization-Pacific (DITCO-PAC) contracted with suppliers
  of communication services (generally common commercial carriers)
  on behalf of Department and Agencies within the Department
  of Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration and various
  other Government agencies for lease of communication services
  and equipment at locations within the State of Hawaii and within
  the Pacific area. The service requirements include a wide spectrum
  of communication services, ranging from narrow band (voice
  grade) to wide band (56kbps and greater), voice and data, switch
  and dedicated services, and equipment. These leased services
  are generally point-to-point dedicated private line communication
  with two (2) service terminals located on military or other
  Government property. To the maximum extent possible, DITCO
  leases all components of each individual telecommunications
  service requirement (including transmission facilities and
  customer premise equipment) from a single source. During the
  past quarter approximately 17 services were awarded. The average
  monthly recurring charge per award was $7,114.00.  Based on
  an average life of 60 months the average life cycle cost of
  each award was $426,840.00.  DITCO-PAC desires to expand its  
  current list of available sources having the experience and 
  resources necessary to successfully compete for and perform under 
  new contracts for delivery of these types of services. If your
