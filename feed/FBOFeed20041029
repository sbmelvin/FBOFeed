<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate with Interindustry Economic Research Fund, Inc. on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) only one responsible source for a 12-month base period and four addition 12-month option periods.  

The responsibilities of the Office of Policy Development (OPD) within the Economic and Statistics Administation (ESA)include’s the ability to evaluate impacts to industries and the economy.  Recent examples of OPD’s use of the Long-Term Forecasting Tool (LIFT) model was to examine the economic consequences of terrorist attack scenarios--three scenarios for the Department of Homeland Security and one for the Council of Economic Advisers.   OPD, over the last two years, also used the model to assess industry performance: Information Technology (IT) industries in ESA/OPD’s Digital Economy reports, IT Use in Infrastructure Industries, and estimating the size and the economic performance of Biotechnology industries.  LIFT was also used in providing support for understanding impacts of various industry issues that could affect the Administration’s domestic policy:  implementing steel tariffs, higher crude oil prices, reduced petroleum refining capacity, and a possible longshoreman’s strike on the West Coast.

In order to perform these types of tasks, OPD needs an interindustry input-output model that measures interindustry transactions consistent with industry value added in the economy and total economic final demand (GDP).  The model needs to be versatile enough so that impacts to individual industries can be simulated in the economy as well as the effects of macroeconomic variables on individual industry performance.  The model also needs to relate output to jobs by occupations and by number of employees.  The INFORUM LIFT model meets all of these criteria.

Offerors certain they can meet the requirements are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis.

All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the attention of Juanita Beck, Procurement Specialist.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>This synopsis replaces the earlier Presolicitation Notice for Encoders and Monitors, dated 14 Oct 2004, which is deleted in its entirety. SYNOPSIS: The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) 412 Test Wing, Edwards AFB, CA has a requirement for flight termination system Encoders, Monitors and Triple Data Encryption Standard (3 DES) units (TDU). These units will support the Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) Project. The EFTS will provide a secure and robust method for terminating the errant flight of unmanned test vehicles operating on or from National Test & Evaluation (T&E) ranges. The EFTS will accomplish this by transmitting digital command messages instead of traditional analog tones to activate termination. The encoder will integrate into flight termination ground stations to format flight termination command messages.  The monitor will be integrated into flight termination ground stations to monitor radio frequencies transmitted by the Command Transmitter System (CTS) to verify proper EFTS command transmission. The TDU will integrate into the encoders and monitors to encrypt and decrypt EFTS command messages. This Synopsis is just partial information on the encoder, monitor, and TDU requirement. This synopsis, in its entirety, has graphics that will not post under the FedBizOpps synopsis software program. Therefore, Industry is referred to the FedBizOpps upload that is being posted under the encoder, monitor and TDU, simultaneously with this Synopsis notice. The encoder and monitor will integrate into a command transmitter system operating in conjunction with the TDU devices. Figure 1 (under the upload) shows the components that comprise a flight termination system. The shaded boxes indicate the units the EFTS Project will develop. This synopsis is only concerned with the development of the encoder, monitor and TDU. The encoder is colored orange, the monitor blue and the TDU purple to show their relationship to the other components. A command control unit will output a 64-bit command message to the encoder. The TDU is embedded in the encoder. The TDU will encrypt the 64-bit command messages. The encoder will then add 19 bits for frame synchronization, 61 bits for Forward Error Correction and encode the resulting 144-bit message using bi-phase level symbol (e.g. Manchester) encoding. The bi-phase signal is then output at 7200 bps to an exciter unit and high powered amplifier for transmission. The encoder must support a number of indicators and controls: power on, power indicator, lamp test, key loading, valid key status indicator, key selection, key zerorization, fault identification, self test message, error detection and reporting and error reset. The encoder shall fit into a standard Electronic Industries Association (EIA) 19-inch rack that is a maximum 1 rack unit (nominal 1.75 inches=1 rack unit) in height.  The encoder shall not extend more than 20 inches deep. Handles shall be affixed to facilitate removal and installation. The encoder shall be provided with rack slides. The weight of the encoder excluding the TDU shall not exceed 10 lb. The monitor will be used as a situational awareness tool for range safety personnel. The primary purpose of the monitor is to (monitor) signals transmitted from the CTS. Appropriate EFTS signals will be demodulated, decrypted and decoded. The monitor will provide a number of interfaces: power, RF Input, Status and Control Interface, RF or IF Output, Post Detection Output, Post Detection Input, Post Correction Output and Post Decryption Output. The monitor will support the following indicators and controls at a minimum: power on, power indicator, lamp test, key loading, valid key status indicator, key selection, key zerorization, fault identification, self test message, error detection and reporting, Built-In-Test (BIT) and error reset. The monitor shall fit into a standard EIA 19-inch rack that is a maximum 3 rack units (nominal 1.75 inches = 1 rack unit) in height. The monitor shall not extend more than 20 inches deep. Handles shall be affixed to facilitate removal and installation. The monitor shall be provided with rack slides. The weight of the monitor excluding the TDU shall not exceed 30 pounds. The TDU will be a plug-in module to the encoder or monitor device from the front panel, and secured using fixed (e.g. thumbscrews) attachment techniques that do not require tools. That is, the design should allow the item to slide into a third party device without attaching individual connectors. The encoder or monitor will be powered off when the item is installed.

<DESC>C-Architect-Engineer Services Solicitation # GS-04P-04-EXC-0038 – Anniston, Alabama, Contracting Officer, Denise Butler,  404-331-4627.

Continuing a centuries-old legacy of extraordinary public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects to design Federal buildings of outstanding quality and value, buildings that provide superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees as well as give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a New U. S. Federal Courthouse to be constructed in Anniston, Alabama in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  The building is approximately 5 340 gross square meters (gsm) 57,482 gross square feet (gsf) without parking, and approximately 6 084 gsm 65,482 gsf including 20 interior parking spaces.  The proposed courthouse will provide a total of two (2) courtrooms: - one (1) district, and one (1) bankruptcy courtroom.  The building will house the District, Magistrate and Bankruptcy Courts; U. S. Attorney; U. S. Marshals Service; U. S. Probation;  House Of Representatives Field Office and GSA.  The proposed facility will be constructed in downtown Anniston, AL with the exact site still to be determined.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is approximately $11 million to $16  million.

This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 52.219-19).  This procurement is set-aside and restricted to small businesses.  The NAICS Code is 541310; the size standard is $4.0 million gross average receipts over  three (3) years.

Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. (4) LEAD DESIGNER PORTFOLIO (30%): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer’s ability to provide design excellence.  If a single designer, submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project, and a typewritten description (maximum of two pages per project) of up to three projects completed in the last ten years.  If the lead designer is a team, submit graphics and typewritten description of up to two projects from each lead designer discipline.  The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and Operations & Maintenance objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria (1), the Lead Designer will address his or her participation in the project.  An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short-list of approximately three to six firms.  

For STAGE II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.  The firms will be required to complete Standard Forms 330 – Architect-Engineer Qualifications Parts I & II,  that reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  In developing the project team for the Stage II submission, the A/E Firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed within the state of Alabama.  The office(s) meeting this 35% (minimum) requirement must have an active production office within the state of Alabama established at least 90 days prior to the date of this announcement.  As a member of the A/E team, the Architect of Record must be licensed in the state of Alabama.  The required license must be in place within 60 days of award of the contract.  The Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the design team’s understanding of the unique aspects of the project, their design philosophy, project management process, and quality assurance plan.  Firms selected to participate in STAGE II will be further evaluated by an anonymous, one-day design charrette, judged by a jury of independent design professionals.  The purpose of the design charrette is to further evaluate the A/E’s qualifications for the project.  Details and procedures for the design charrette will be provided to the firms selected to participate in Stage II.  The submitted design concepts become the property of the government and may or may not be the basis, in whole or in part, for the development of the final building design.

<DESC>The US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to award a production contract for a handheld radio system that is Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant.  The primary objective of the Special Forces-Hand Held Radio (SF-HHR) program is to leverage ongoing industry initiatives in the area of software defined, reprogrammable radio technologies to satisfy Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and threshold technical/operational requirements as found in the Multiband Inter/Intra Team Radio (MBITR) Joint Operational Requirements Document (JORD), 01 OCT 2001.  The SF-HHR requirement is for a rugged, militarized handheld system including accessories.  Threshold performance parameters include:  an operating frequency range of 30 to 512 MHz; both amplitude and frequency modulation (AM/FM) modes of operation; Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certified SINCGARS-ESIP and HAVE QUICK II Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM) capabilities, National Security Agency (NSA) endorsed embedded US Type I encryption providing as a minimum VINSON, FASCINATOR, ANDVT/KGV-5, KGV-10 and receive OTAR/OTAT capabilities.  
 
USSOCOM intends to release an RFP in January 2005 with proposals and production representative hardware due February 2005.  The program and technical requirements will be described in a Government provided SOO and the MBITR JORD.  Offeror’s proposals shall include a Statement of Work (SOW), Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) and a Technical/Performance Specification for the proposed SF-HHR.  The basis for contract award shall be BEST VALUE.  The technical evaluation will assess both the written proposal and an Initial Production Sample (IPS) Demonstration (IPSD) at a Government facility.  The IPSD will assess the handheld radio, radio accessories including all cables and vehicle adapter.  The solicitation will identify the IPSD set-up, procedures, and performance parameters to be demonstrated.  The purpose of the IPSD is to assess the technical maturity of the radio and its accessories as well as the realism of the offeror’s proposed schedule for delivery of production systems.  If the IPS does not include all the KPPs and threshold performance parameters described in the SOO, offeror's Performance Specification and JORD, then the offeror shall explain in the technical proposal what additional effort is required to fully implement them.  

NSA endorsement, JITC Interoperability Assessments, and JTel SCA compliance certifications, in all modes of operation, are the sole responsibility of the offeror.  The Government desires that the IPS be NSA endorsed and JITC/JTeL certified prior to the demonstration but no later than July 2005 to support Government testing.  If however, the required certifications have not been obtained prior to the demonstration, then the technical proposal shall describe in detail the offeror’s plan and schedule to obtain these certifications. The Government anticipates, upon conclusion of source selection, the award of a 5 year, Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) production contract including Integrated Logistics Support (ILS).  The known quantity of new production radios and retrofit of the MBITR to the SF-HHR configuration is 6518 and 12,200 respectively. Additionally, various quantities of accessories including vehicle adapters will be procured.  The aforementioned documents will be available electronically on the FEDBIZOPS at: www.gotahaveit.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) anticipates award of several five-year Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs) to support the Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) in the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA/CMM). The Source/Origin Code for this activity will be 000 or as designated in future task orders. The CMM Office has three broad areas of focus: 1) early warning and analysis of conflict and state failure; 2) the development of new assistance models and program options that are better able to deal with the causes and consequences of conflict and fragility; and 3) provide technical leadership and Agency-wide field support, training and outreach in conflict management and mitigation. Building on the definitions of conflict mitigation and management provided in the new Agency Conflict Policy, the Guidelines outline three broad types of activities that USAID will undertake to address deadly conflict, and state failure. These include: conflict mitigation activities that respond directly to overt violence or the imminent threat of violence; conflict management activities that are explicitly geared toward addressing the causes and consequences of conflict and fragility, but are often implemented within a more traditional development sector such as democracy and governance, economic growth, the effective delivery of services in areas such as health and education, or the more effective management of natural resources; and conflict sensitive development and humanitarian assistance that do not have conflict mitigation or management as a central objective but nonetheless need to be designed to ensure that they do not inadvertently contribute to the potential for violent conflict or fragility, that is, that they “do no harm.” Conflict mitigation program components include mediation of specific disputes, peace advocacy, negotiation and implementation of peace agreements, community-based reconciliation, reintegration of ex-combatants and other war-affected groups, mechanisms for restorative justice, such as truth and reconciliation commissions. Conflict management programs include interventions that are distinct from regular development in that the short to medium term goals are to manage destabilizing trends that feed into deadly violence or state failure, but that can also lay the groundwork for significant results in longer-term, more traditional sectoral programs with the goal of integrating a concern for conflict and fragility into traditional development sectors. The IQC will also include a rapid response capacity (or “stand-by” mechanism) to support CMM and the Agency during times of high demand for experienced field staff; and monitoring and evaluation assistance support to CMM and the Agency related to conflict management and mitigation. This proposed mechanism does not replace the USAID/REDSO Managing African Conflict (MAC) but is a complimentary resource that will be available on a world-wide basis. USAID anticipates awarding approximately three (3) contracts, including an estimated two (2) unrestricted and one (1) set-aside for a small business, on the condition that it is capable of undertaking the work. USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering limitation of the contracts resulting from this RFP will be $400,000,000 over the five (5) year ordering period. Note that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate; each successful contractor will be eligible to compete on all task orders until the shared ceiling for all contracts is reached. Note that there is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded, the number of task orders that any one firm will receive, or the amount of money each firm is entitled to beyond the minimum monetary amount stated in the RFP. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541611. The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no solicitation will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.

A sole source acquisition is required under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) due to Genesys’ experience providing organizational alignment and integration strategies to NAVSEA and other Navy agencies. This experience makes them uniquely qualified to leverage this experience to provide alignment strategies across the Navy Systems Commands. Only Genesys can perform the required effort in a timely and cost effective manner without causing undue delay and unnecessary duplication of efforts and costs. The anticipated period of performance is 10-22 months if all options are exercised. This effort includes comprehensive review and analysis of key activities currently underway throughout the Command; application of and implementation of recommendations for leadership frameworks including Alignment, Execution Readiness, and Change Leadership; and analysis identifying gaps and demonstrated best practices within the Command to successfully accelerate the NAVSEA ! transformation. No phone inquires will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing by email to Ms. Lynn Fox at foxlm@navsea.navy.mil.   See Note 22.

<DESC>The Office of Public Health Service, OPA  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy (NCPTP), Washington, DC .

Purpose:

Data from Cycle VI of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) are scheduled to be released late this summer (2004).  The NSFG, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, is the largest and most comprehensive source of data on fertility, marriage, divorce and reproductive health in the U.S.  The survey covers a national sample of women 15-44 years of age and, for the first time, Cycle VI will include a national sample of men 15-49 years of age.   Of particular interest to the Office of Population Affairs (OPA), as well as the adolescent pregnancy prevention community in general, will be the data on adolescent sexual behavior, pregnancy, and childbearing.  The last cycle of the NSFG was done in 1995; early and detailed analyses of  the new cycle are of great importance in efforts to understand the factors underlying the ongoing trends in adolescent sexual and fertility behavior and in developing effective prevention strategies.

The purpose of this project is to generate statistics from the new NSFG for adolescent females and males  on sexual behavior, pregnancy and childbearing.  Trend analyses will also be prepared using  Cycles III, IV and V of the NSFG for adolescent females and the 1988 and 1995 National Survey of Adolescent Males (NSAM) for adolescent males.  This information will be disseminated widely in a Chart Book , as well as a series of fact sheets covering selected topics in more detail: an overview of the sexual experience of adolescents; unwanted and nonvoluntary adolescent sexual experiences; characteristics of adolescents who are not sexually active; parent/child communication; and risk prevention interventions for adolescents.

Since the  NCPTP was established in 1995, it has built a solid reputation for developing  studies and reports, of the highest caliber, in the areas of adolescent sexual behavior, pregnancy and childbearing—both describing their prevalence and exploring strategies for prevention.  These endeavors have been, as this one will be, overseen by the NCPTP’s Effective Programs and Research Task Force (EPR), currently chaired by Dr. Brent Miller, Vice-President for Research at Utah State University and composed of a group of highly regarded social scientists in the field of adolescent pregnancy prevention.    In addition to its strong track record on report development, the NCPTP has an equally strong record on dissemination, guaranteeing a reach into the field that is both broad and deep.

 NCPTP has capacity to begin work immediately and complete it in a timely manner.  In addition to the EPR, on site research staff are well qualified, experienced in the field of adolescent pregnancy prevention, and available for assignment to the various tasks that will be required.   Reductions in adolescent sexual activity and pregnancy have been observed for some years.  Data from a number of sources indicate that these positive trends continue.  An early and detailed look at Cycle VI of the NSFG will provide additional confirmation and the more in-depth analyses of related topics will add richness and context as the field continues to develop and implement risk prevention programs for our Nation’s youth.

Given the match between the requirements of the intended project and the capacities of the NCPTP, as well as its ability to undertake the project in the immediate manner necessary for timely dissemination of the new data from the NSFG, will result in useful  products and efficient completion of the work.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This modification is to correct the description in which the date due of 30 Nov 04 was not corrected in the descriptive text. It should read as:
DESCRIPTION: This notice replaces notice dated 27 Sep 2004, reference number DECON, with an original response date of 8 Nov 2004.  That notice is cancelled and replaced by this posting.  The classification code is changed from 42 – fire fighting, rescue & safety equipment to 68 - Chemical and Chemical Products, and the response date is now 30 November 2004.
DESCRIPTION:  The Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) Systems Manager is examining all current decontaminants and applicators to determine what interim solutions exist for the ability to decontaminate the interiors of vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft, to include sensitive equipment within, which have been exposed to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents/contamination and/or Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs)/Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and new threat agents (NTAs).     This requirement is associated with Joint Service and multinational capabilities for detecting, identifying and eliminating CBRN hazards. JPID will decontaminate sensitive equipment items installed in platform interiors without requiring removal of the equipment.

This announcement is for mature chemical and biological (CB) agent decontamination systems.     Mature, is Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Six or higher per DoD 5000.2-R, Appendix 6.     TRL-6 means that a system prototype has been demonstration in a relevant environment.     Prototype system is well beyond the breadboard and has been tested in a relevant environment.     Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment.     Your applicator/technology must offer significant improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered. Your applicator/technology must offer significantly improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered.
Capability for the decontamination effort review is the ability to decontaminate chemical and biological agents on non-removable sensitive pieces of equipment, located in vehicles, aircraft or shipboard areas. At a minimum these systems shall use applicators that are man-portable or do not require dedicated prime movers (trailer mounts or ?slip ins? are acceptable).     Due to the operational environment, decontaminants that can be stored at up to 150oF without significant loss of effectiveness are needed. 

For consideration, potential decontamination technology providers must: l) Demonstrate decontamination efficacy against chemical warfare agents.     Provide testing results on the efficacy against VX, HD and a G-type agent performed by a reputable Chemical Agent Surety Laboratory, either domestic or foreign. 2) Demonstrate a decontamination efficacy to kill bacterial spores such as Bacillus anthracis or simulant such as B. subtilis, B. globigii, or B. thuringensis, etc.     3) Supply decontaminant/ system information on material compatibility. The general materials in the various platforms consist of categories such as plastics, alloys, elastomers, metals to name a few. If data on the system does not exist, at the minimum, a paper study of the components should be provided. 4) Supply Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on all products.     5) Provide evidence of production capability/capacity. 6) Not produce any uncontrollable hazards (residue or secondary) that are toxic or corrosive during decontamination operations. 7) Describe or illustrate packaging and/or mixing options.     8) Disclose detailed shipping and storage requirements or restrictions as well as the results of pot and shelf life testing.     9) Be compatible with Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) clothing and not present a hazard to equipment or personnel while being operated in MOPP.     10) Using its product, provide the results of developmental and operational testing in the decontamination of integral sensitive equipment, fixed facilities such as buildings, and terrain.     11) Provide procedures for applying the decontaminant on large equipment, aircraft, vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft, to include sensitive equipment within. 12) Identify on-going federal, commercial, DoD contractual effort that is within scope of the above objectives along with point of contact and contact information. 
NOTE:     Any change in the formulation of a selected product requires resubmission of updated (e.g. surety, material compatibility, pot life, shelf life, etc.) data.

For submissions to be considered as decontamination systems, developers/sponsors must electronically supply (.doc or .pdf format) the preceding information in the order and format in which it is presented to Mr. Leo Gomez, leo.gomez@brooks.af.mil, no later than close of business November 30, 2004. Telephonic and hard copy responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>Amendment 01 has been issued. 

Federal Technology Service, Technical Services Division is releasing a FINAL Request for Proposal for Information Technology Engineering, Scientific, Technical and Analytical Services.  Services under this requirement may include development of new technology to support existing functionality; all phases of system engineering (including reverse engineering of conceptual designs); component development of new hardware and software; security/information assurance for systems,  networks, hardware, software and firmware components; cryptographic development & validation; limited hardware/software/firmware support; and training.  These services are in support of Fleet Numerical Meteorology & Oceanography Center (FNMOC) located in Monterey, CA.   FNMOC is responsible for around-the-clock operational meteorological and oceanographic support to the U.S. Navy, other U.S. Government agencies, and elements of the armed forces of allied nations providing numerical environmental global forecast models for ships, aircraft, and other forces throughout DOD.  FNMOC is DOD's principle operations processing center for automated numerical, meteorological and oceanographic analysis and prediction and has been designated the ForceNet Development Node.  This requirement will support the ForceNet concept for the U.S Navy.  ForceNet is defined as "the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the information age that integrates warriors, sensors, networks, command and control, platforms, and weapons into a networked, distributed combat force that is scalable across all levels of conflict from seabed to space and sea to land."   ForceNet implements the theory of network-centric warfare.

This procurement is being conducted using a multiple award, indefinite delivery/ indefinite quantity (IDIQ) approach.  Award of the basic IDIQ contract will enable firms to compete for individual task orders over the life of the contract.  We anticipate award of the basic contract will be made to those firms offering the overall "best-value."  

The contract is planned to be for a twenty-four (24) month base period, plus three (3), twelve (12) month options, and incorporate multiple pricing methods (Fixed Price/Labor Hour/Time & Materials & Cost reimbursable.)  The estimated value of work is $20 million for each year.  Offeror's may be required to possess security clearances up to Top Secret.     


This is a FINAL RFP based on the draft version issued under GS10T04ECD02. This solicitation is considered "Open Continuous", Offers submitted on or before August 24, 2004 (9:00 a.m. local time) will be included in the first group, and those received on or before August 31, 2004 (9:00 a.m. local time) will become the second group. These two groups will be included in the intial round of proposal evaluation and awards.

<DESC>Federal Technology Service, Technical Services Division is releasing a FINAL Request for Proposal for Information Technology Engineering, Scientific, Technical and Analytical Services.  Services under this requirement may include development of new technology to support existing functionality; all phases of system engineering (including reverse engineering of conceptual designs); component development of new hardware and software; security/information assurance for systems,  networks, hardware, software and firmware components; cryptographic development & validation; limited hardware/software/firmware support; and training.  These services are in support of Fleet Numerical Meteorology & Oceanography Center (FNMOC) located in Monterey, CA.   FNMOC is responsible for around-the-clock operational meteorological and oceanographic support to the U.S. Navy, other U.S. Government agencies, and elements of the armed forces of allied nations providing numerical environmental global forecast models for ships, aircraft, and other forces throughout DOD.  FNMOC is DOD's principle operations processing center for automated numerical, meteorological and oceanographic analysis and prediction and has been designated the ForceNet Development Node.  This requirement will support the ForceNet concept for the U.S Navy.  ForceNet is defined as "the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the information age that integrates warriors, sensors, networks, command and control, platforms, and weapons into a networked, distributed combat force that is scalable across all levels of conflict from seabed to space and sea to land."   ForceNet implements the theory of network-centric warfare.

This procurement is being conducted using a multiple award, indefinite delivery/ indefinite quantity (IDIQ) approach.  Award of the basic IDIQ contract will enable firms to compete for individual task orders over the life of the contract.  We anticipate award of the basic contract will be made to those firms offering the overall "best-value."  

The contract is planned to be for a twenty-four (24) month base period, plus three (3), twelve (12) month options, and incorporate multiple pricing methods (Fixed Price/Labor Hour/Time & Materials & Cost reimbursable.)  The estimated value of work is $20 million for each year.  Offeror's may be required to possess security clearances up to Top Secret.     


This is a FINAL RFP based on the draft version issued under GS10T04ECD02. This solicitation is considered "Open Continuous", Offers submitted on or before August 24, 2004 (9:00 a.m. local time) will be included in the first group, and those received on or before August 31, 2004 (9:00 a.m. local time) will become the second group. These two groups will be included in the intial round of proposal evaluation and awards. All other proposals received (after group 1 & 2) will be evaluated quarterly based upon receipt of the proposal on or before the last working day of each quarter (Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec.)

<CONTACT>Mark Snell, Contract Specialist, Phone (360396-0239, Fax (360)396-0853, Email mark.snell@navy.mil
<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is open to 8(a) firms only.  The Government intends for the 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $15,000.  The $15,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $100 Million.  The NTE amount for each contract will be $120 Million divided by the number of contract awardees. Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000 and $1,500,000.  Note, an additional Large 8(a) MACC will be awarded by the conclusion of Fiscal Year 2004 with a Task Order award range of $1,000,000 to $6,000,000.  Offerors can submit proposals for both MACC vehicles.  
	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.  Representative types of projects for NAICS 236 include, but are not limited to: administrative and industrial facilities, housing renovation, childcare centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional buildings, manufacturing and industrial buildings and other similar facilities.
     Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
     The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.     
     THE SOLICITATION WILL BE OFFERED IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  NO HARD COPIES WILL BE PROVIDED.  The solicitation package, including plans and specifications will be posted on the NAVFAC electronic solicitation website http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to check the web site for any updates to the status of the solicitation or other notices.  The only plan-holder list available is via the ESOL website under this solicitation number.  Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  The response time set by FAR 5.203 will begin on the date of issuance of the solicitation.  The solicitation will be posted on or about November 30, 2004.  The estimated period of proposal preparation will be at least 30 days.  The e-mail address for inquiries is: mark.snell@navy.mil.

Technical POC/ Program Manager, John Vergis, AFRL/IFEA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome  NY 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-1771, email: John.Vergis@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori L.

The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division in collaboration with U.S. Joint Forces Command and Electronic Systems Center are soliciting proposals for innovative approaches in support of the Multi-sensor Aerospace-ground Joint ISR Interoperability Coalition (MAJIIC) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD).  The objective of MAJIIC is to demonstrate network-centric "Post Before Process" ISR capabilities that will enable warfighters and C2ISR systems on IP based operational C2I networks to access and utilize near real time ISR data. ISR data of interest includes mission and sensor data from U.S. Joint Service and Multi-national coalition manned and unmanned air platforms with an initial focus on video, EO, IR, SAR, GMTI, and ELINT sensors. MAJIIC capabilities will be open, scalable, secure, and non-intrusive to current operational ISR architectures; support common and emerging DoD/NATO/Commercial data formats; provide data pedigree and quality tagging; provide a range of data access methods including XML-based Web services and APIs; work in bandwidth challenged environments on DoD operational networks; and provide a flexible architecture that will support both distributed and traditional client-server deployments.  The ultimate goal of MAJIIC is to improve ISR data accessibility and utility in support of time sensitive missions, battlefield situational awareness, decision making, and C2I analysis. 

The MAJIIC PRDA will focus on the following technology areas: database optimization techniques; XML-based web services; automated video, imagery and streaming data optimum dissemination techniques; and common geo-registration. In the area of database optimization, technologies are sought to find the optimal techniques in the storage, cataloging, retrieval, and searching of video, EO, IR, SAR, GMTI, and ELINT sensor data, and mission situational awareness information, that will enhance the ability to share data across Service, Joint, and Coalition networks. This will include data parsing, conversion, compression, cataloging, and tagging. In the area of XML web-based services, technologies are sought that will allow for "disadvantaged" users (bandwidth challenged and/or lacking an application that supports raw ISR data formats) to access and display ISR data over the operational network in a legacy and/or commercial formats.  Advanced XML-based web services are also sought to support distributed machine-to-machine interactions, as well as concepts for managing information services across theater networks (e.g., service interface standards, service registries, ontology, access control).  Automated video, imagery, and streaming data dissemination techniques are required to allow for the optimal distribution of real-time and archived video, GMTI, EO, IR, SAR, ELINT, mission, and steaming data across networks that may have limited bandwidth constraints. Common geo-registration is needed to accurately determine target location by reducing detection errors from multiple sensors; MAJIIC is specifically concerned with registering GMTI detections, SAR, ELINT, EO, IR, and video data.  These technologies will be used and validated in military exercises, currently scheduled annually, two (2) per year.  The expectation is that one of these exercises will be in the U.S. and the other exercise will be in the Europe.  Exercise participation will include integration and checkout prior to the exercise, military operator training, technical support during the exercise, performance and discrepancy data collection, and post-exercise analysis.  Additionally, there will be approximately four (4) working group meetings per year, two (2) of which will be in the U.S. and two (2) in Europe, with each meeting lasting approximately one week.

An unclassified briefing for all interested firms will be held on 1 October 2003, at the Beeches Hotel and Conference Center, 7900 Turin Rd (Rt. 26), Rome, NY 13440 at 0900 hours.  A hard-copy briefing package will be made available to all attendees.  Please contact John Vergis at (315) 330-1771 (e-mail John.Vergis@rl.af.mil) or Lt. Tony Rendon (315) 330-2548 (e-mail: Antonio.Rendon@rl.af.mil) no later than 29 September 2003 if you plan to attend.  Firms who do not attend the briefing, but desire to have a copy of the additional material can access this information from the FedBizOps special notice available at http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda-main.html , under the 03-16 PRDA link.

This PRDA is accepting white papers until 1 Oct 2009, but white papers must be submitted by no later than 10 Oct 03 for consideration of the initial FY 04 award. White papers submitted after this date are less likely to be funded in FY04.  Beyond FY 04, it is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY 05 should be submitted by 1 May 04; FY 06 by 1 May 05; FY 07 by 1 May 06; and, FY 08 by 1 May 07. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper which shall be considered.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) Soundness of Approach; (2) Relevance to the Mission; (3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and (4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness. Note: Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4. Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this PRDA.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Individual awards will not normally exceed 48 months with dollar amounts ranging between $200,000 to $800,000 per fiscal year. Total funding for this PRDA is anticipated to be $24.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this PRDA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 04 - $1.000M; FY 05 - $5.565M; FY 06 - $6.195M; FY 07 - $6.565M and FY 08 - $5.175.  Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the US SECRET and NATO SECRET level; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for, or eligible for, access to US SECRET and NATO SECRET information. In addition, the offeror must have or have access to a certified and Government-approved facility available to support work under this PRDA. Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.  Questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal, including inquiries regarding white papers should be addressed to the technical POC, John Vergis/315-330-1771, John.Vergis@rl.af.mil.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition. A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. The Government may use the services of MITRE, SYTEX and ACS Defense Systems personnel in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of proposals.  The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government.  Representatives of the foregoing firm(s) participating in the evaluation process will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals.  Submission of a proposal constitutes permission to release the proposal to the identified firms for evaluation purposes.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice to assist NIST in completing market research for a procurement that will be initiated in the near future.  No solicitation is currently available, and no unsolicited proposals will be entertained as a result of this sources sought notice.

NIST currently utilizes a Pay for Performance System (PPS) for payroll processing of its employees, and has been using that system for a few years.  The current PPS is developed in Oracle development suite, which includes Oracle Forms, reports and SQLloader.  The backend Oracle database server resides on IBM AIX and the Forms, Reports and SQLLDR is deployed on Microsoft Windows 2000.

NIST IS SEEKING TO IDENTIFY COMPANIES WITH RECENT EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING SYSTEMS, ESPECIALLY BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY PAY FOR PERFORMANCE SYSTEMS, FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WERE REQUIRED TO UTILIZE FEDERAL HUMAN RESOURCES LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT SYSTEM.

SUMMARY OF RELEVANT CHARACTERISTICS OF CURRENT PPS AND CHARACTERISTCS OF MODIFIED OR NEW PPS:

The current NIST PPS needs to be modified, or a new system may need to be developed, in the very near future (this fiscal year) to reflect new FY 2005 NIST PPS requirements.  Basically, the PPS, either modified or new, will need to support several different NIST user groups and their tasks accordingly:

1) Application administration group: This group will perform the application access control, running system reports for senior managers, process all necessary pre and post pay out performance processing tasks which include loading the locality data from the U. S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), update pay pool access right, archive history data and freeze employees data, running employees reconciliation comparison reports against each pay period HR employee’s data, determines when the file to update the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Finance Center (NFC) Paypers database is to be generated the system and sent to NFC, etc.

2) Senior Management Advisor (SMA) group:

Each NIST Operating Unit (OU) has one SMA and the SMA’s role in PPS is to verify employee’s status, identify pay pool managers and rating officials, handle pay out bonus and increase, run reports and other tasks.

3) Pay Pool managers /Rating officials group:

Pay pool managers/rating officials give out the rating; pay increase and bonus amount to their staff.  Typically, this group of users would like to download the data to their own MS Excel to manipulate the data outside of the system.

4) Operating Unit (OU) group:

Each OU has the ability to give and/or modify ratings, pay increases and bonus amounts for their employees.  This group of users can download information into MS Excel and run OU reports.

5) Chief Office group:

This is a new requirement for the FY 2005 PPS.  This group does not exist in the current PPS.  The primary purpose of this function is for NIST Chief Officers to have the functions of the OU, but is limited to their organization instead of the entire OU.

6) NIST Director and OU directors group

This is the new requirement of the FY 2005 PPS.  This function does not exist in the current PPS.  The primary purpose of the function is for NIST directory to pre-calculate the NIST-wide salary increase (I) then each OU’s director can use that I or publish a lower I for his/her OU.

Basically, the PPS change from old to new is the following: Replace scoring and ranking with six performance levels; link performance pay increase to performance levels; convert pay increase to bonuses for pay-capped high performers; place annual cost-of-living increase (ACI) at risk for low performers.

Note: The current NIST PPS is tied to the Annual Cost-of-living Increase system (ACI). Therefore, a modification of the current PPS would include the modification of the ACI. Development of a new PPS would have to be designed such that it could integrate a new ACI in the near future.

The new PPS will be required to use Oracle database, PL/SQL for handling business logic processing and Oracle SQLLDR for data loading.  A front end graphical user interface (GUI) may need to be developed.  

The system will be contracted for in FY 2005, with a required completion date of no later than April 30, 2005.  The procurement process is anticipated to begin on/about December 1, 2004, with an award likely by January 15, 2004.  NIST estimates that approximately 2-3 full time equivalent Contractor personnel may be required to complete the requirements.

If your company possesses relevant experience for projects that are similar in scope to what may be required to implement the foregoing, then please provide the following types of information by email to Joseph.Widdup@nist.gov no later than November 15, 2004:

1.  Description of each similar project completed by your company as a prime Contractor or as a significant subcontractor within the past three (3) years, including:

(a) dollar amount of the contract;

(b) brief description of the technical requirements of that project;

(c) contract type used on that project (e.g., firm-fixed-price, labor-hour, time-and-materials, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, etc.);

(d) indication of how long the project took to complete from start to finish;

(e) how many Contractor and, if applicable, subcontractor full time equivalents were required to complete the job; and

(f) name, address, point of contact and phone number of customer organization for which the work was done.

2.  Current socioeconomic status of your company as it relates to NAICS 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services (see NAICS table at http://www.sba.gov/size/sizetable2002.html); also, whether your company is currently certified as an 8(a) company or a service-disabled veteran-owned company.

3.  Indication of whether your company currently has its own GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract and whether your company currently can provide IT developmental services under that contract; and

4.  Indication of whether your company currently has an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>1. Fairchild Air Force Base is requesting industry comment on new and rebuilt paving and curbing work associated with streets, parking lots, driveways, sidewalks and curbs. We are seeking engineering and local industry review of the attached specifications and comments on the following questions:
(A) Are the specifications complete and up to date for the manner in which this type of work is currently being performed in the industry?  If not, what changes would you recommend.?
(B) Are the line items described in the attachments adequate for the tasks?  These are new and rebuilt projects ranging from repair to complete demo and reconstruction, asphalt and concrete roads, driveways, parking lots, curbs, and sidewalks as well as repair of any adjacent landscaping.  If not, what line items need to be added?
(C) As the unit prices for this contract are based on quantity, are the quantity ranges for each main line item sufficient to allow ease of pricing for both the contractor and the government?  If not, which line items are deficient and how should they be modified?  Please limit the amounts of ranges to be used for the line items.
(D) Are the specifications and line items sufficiently clear that contractors can easily follow them to properly price and perform any variation of projects.  If not, what improvements should be done to help clarify the specifications and line items? 
(E) In light of the recent volatility in material prices, would it be reasonable to ask for firm fixed line item pricing for 1-5 years out?
2.	Please submit all comments to Richard Hedrick at richard.hedrick@fairchild.af.mil no later than 10 Dec 04.

<SUBJECT>A -- New Space Independent Research & Development (IR&D) Review Process
<DESC>The DoD Executive Agent for Space, Mr. Peter B. Teets, has requested a new process to improve Space IR&D communications between government and industry.  In addition, industry has requested a broader opportunity to get feedback as to how well their efforts fit with the government’s future plans.  In response, we have developed a new Space IR&D Process.  Our approach is to hold two major conferences a year to review Space IR&D technologies and investments, with follow-up visits to select companies for further in-depth review.  The new process will be pilot tested in the Space Community the first year with the intention of moving it Air Force-wide and possibly across the DoD. 

Conference Specifics.  Both IR&D conferences will be run in the same manner.  They will be conducted in the Spring and Fall, each one week long.  The first IR&D Conference will be held at Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs from 6-10 Dec 04 at HQ AFSPC, Building 1 Auditorium, for Day One and the Leadership Development Center, Bldg 910, for Days 2 through 5.  Monday will consist of government briefings.  From Tuesday morning through Friday morning there will be a series of one-on-one briefings from selected companies with government feedback.  We will have a second conference in the April/May timeframe, time and location still to be determined.  For details, visit AFRL’s website http://www.afrl.af.mil/announce/symposiums.html and select “IRAD Conference”.  Mr. Joe Sciabica of AFRL is designated as the team lead with support from senior leadership at HQ AFSPC, and SMC/TD.  Mr. Peter B. Teets, the Under Secretary of the Air Force and DoD Executive Agent for Space, is scheduled to be the keynote speaker. 

Government Message.  Monday will consist of government briefings. For this session, we ask each company to limit their attendance to two to three representatives due to conference room seating restrictions. The government intends to discuss investment strategy, objectives, priorities, and resources planned to achieve key future space capabilities. 

One-On-One Discussions with Industry.  For 7-10 Dec, we have scheduled time for one-on-one government sessions with companies.  Due to resource constraints, and our expectations for responses to this announcement, we anticipate having to select a more limited group of companies to participate in these sessions.  Selection for the Fall Conferences will be firm, with a tentative list announced for the Spring Conference.  The government will provide 1-3 hour blocks of time for each company to discuss their corporate strategy, key projects, and leave time for Q&A.  Electronic presentations will be required.  If not selected, we will attempt to schedule over the next series of conferences opportunities for all companies to participate.

Follow-on Site Visits.  After each conference, a more focused government team will visit select companies who briefed for further in-depth review.

Criteria.  We will use the following criteria as part of the selection process to participate in the one-on-one sessions and follow-on site visits: (1) Space IR&D funding levels and (2) Relevance of company efforts to DoD space objectives and interest areas. 

Restrictions.  The meeting is unclassified, U.S. Citizens only.  In order to attend, you must either be a DoD employee or DoD contractor with a valid DD 2345 Certification.

Please clarify whether HUD has any objections to GSA Teaming Arrangements for this solicitation. 
Answer:  This procurement is an open market Commercial Buy,  with full and open competition subject to commercial acquisition rules. As such, HUD will not entertain allowing a GSA Teaming Arrangement.  As a result of this amendment, the date set for receipt of offers remains unchanged at noon on Friday, November 5, 2004.
