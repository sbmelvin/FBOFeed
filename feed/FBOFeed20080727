     MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:   
1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees. 
2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:  
	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D.	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof of insurance.	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the prime contractor including contract number and term).	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year	covering the previous two years.  Contractor employee background checks are conducted at contractor expense.  The background check:
(a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.(b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S. for less than two years).  (c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at Government expense.
Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshals Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).  
3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under business access.  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractors expense.
4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.	b.    is illegally present in the United States.c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

The Contractors employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.
9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.  
Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offerors submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors.  Past performance information shall demonstrates how well the Offeror satisfied its customers on previous contracts and shall  include name(s) for points of contact, telephone numbers, email address, contract number (if any), contract price, period of performance, years performed and any unique qualities of the contract.

1) Price2) Delivery3) Warranty3) Technical Specifications; Provide descriptive literature (i.e. pictures, brochures, detailed specifications, construction specifications, etc.).   The descriptive literature shall adequately address the technical specifications. General statements that the offeror can comply with the requirements will not, by themselves, be adequate.

<CONTACT>Paris N Marshall, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-219-1368, Fax 202-501-3836, Email paris.marshall@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Contracting and Facilities Division (PGE) is seeking an Engineering Firm/Consultant to provide Integrated Blast/Progressive Collapse Analytical Studies for the Office of the Chief Architect.

The Government intends to award one (1) Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Engineering contract pursuant to procedures established by the Brooks Act and FAR Subpart 36.6, with a one year base period and a one-year option period, for a total of two (2) years.  The option year may be exercised within the time frame specified in the resultant contract at the sole discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the performance under the prospective contract.  

BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD.  The proposed contract is being solicited as a 100% Set-Aside for Small Business.   The small business size standard classification is NAICS 541330, Employee Size Standard is $4.5M.  Submitting firms must indicate their size status and that of their sub-consultants (if any).  

OBJECTIVES.  The Federal government has a need to implement the performance-based requirements of the ISC Security Criteria to minimize the threat of progressive collapse due to extreme loadings from blast attack. The primary objective of this study is to provide practicing structural engineers with the design tools needed to reliably produce both safe and economical buildings that satisfy the requirements of the new GSA/UFC Progressive Collapse Criteria, without having to conduct physical tests in order to determine the behavioral limits for the connections being proposed.

BACKGROUND.  GSA has an obligation to provide a secure working environment for its employees and tenants. To provide secure structures, the design of GSA buildings must implement the performance-based requirements of the ISC Security Criteria. 

Currently structural engineers designing GSA steel frame buildings are forced to ignore critical non linear behaviors of beam-to-column connections that are known to initiate progressive collapse of buildings, because no reliable modeling parameters exist in the industry for this purpose.  The results of these analytical studies and the criteria developed from it will provide practicing structural engineers with reliable, convenient and practical modeling tools that can be used to facilitate the capture of complex behaviors, high-order strains, and critical deformations needed to properly assess steel frame and connection performance when subjected to the combined threats of blast and progressive collapse.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES. The Contractor shall provide all management, supervision, labor, administrative support, materials, supplies, and equipment necessary to perform the services under this project.  THIS PROJECT REQUIRES A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER.

BASE PERIOD SERVICES.  The contractor shall develop a project work plan and a schedule of milestone dates for the work to be done (Deliverable 01) and allow for sufficient time to develop, review, and refinement. The plan shall be updated to reflect any approved changes during its progress.

The contractor shall identify candidate structural steel connection types and corresponding parametric sets of connecting member sizes, including those connection types being addressed currently by GSA. The matrix of study material (Deliverable 02) shall be reviewed and approved by the delegated Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), before beginning the analyses.

The contractor shall draw from existing resources and materials in conducting a search of available inelastic connection behaviors and properties for the selected candidate connections that might be part of a related program elsewhere.

The contractor shall develop the design details for each connection type assembly chosen to be analyzed.

The contractor shall conduct numerical simulations based on nonlinear modeling of candidate beam to column connection assemblies, for each parametric set of connection beams and columns, to determine representative dynamic blast and monotonic moment/rotation relationships from which to characterize inelastic connection behaviors and acceptable behavior limits.

Provide an interim Report (Deliverable 03) documenting and summarizing the analyses conducted and the findings and prepare a briefing on the subject to be presented by the COR to GSA management.

The contractor shall develop a project work plan for the option year work, which shall be a logical extension of the original work plan and showing what remaining work needs to be done (Deliverable 04).

Two (2) of the contractor's employees shall travel to GSA, 1800 F Street NW., Washington DC for meetings (at least 2 meetings are anticipated). The meetings are to include updates, and a presentation by the contractor. 

OPTION PERIOD I SERVICES.  The contractor shall update the original matrix (Deliverable 05) of connection types and corresponding parametric sets of member sizes that would complete all the possibilities of connections being used on GSA building designs.

The contractor shall provide details of every connection type assembly chosen to be analyzed.

The contractor shall conduct numerical simulations based on non linear modeling of each connection type and parametric member sizes, to determine the appropriate behavioral properties as an aid in non linear analysis that would be required by the new criteria.

The contractor shall proved a final Report (Deliverable 06) and make a formal Briefing together with the COR to GSA management.

Two (2) of the contractor's employees shall travel to GSA, 1800 F Street NW., Washington DC for meetings (at least 2 meetings are anticipated).  The meetings are to include updates, and a presentation by the contractor. 

TRAVEL.  All travel associated with this project must be approved in advance by the COR.  Travel will be reimbursable AT COST and in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) and FAR Part 31.
