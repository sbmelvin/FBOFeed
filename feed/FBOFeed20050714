<CONTACT>Lorrie Gleghorn Contracting Officer 5032312392     Lorrie_Gleghorn@fws.gov;
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SINGLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO MARVIN DAVIS FOR CONTRUCTION OF FISH BARRIER. Construction of a rock gabion basket fish barrier with a concrete apron on Wall Creek, Washoe County, Nevada.  The contractor will design and construct a fish barrier on Wall Creek to prevent upstream migration of non-native fishes.  Specifics about the project design will be provided to the contractor, and the final design will be approved by the Service prior to the beginning of construction.  The barrier will be designed to accommodate a minimum of 100 year flood flows and will be designed to blend in with the surrounding environment.  The barrier will prevent upstream migration of brown and rainbow trout.  When constructing permanent structures that potentially impound water or adversely affect hydrology of the surrounding area, many factors need to be taken into consideration such as geology, hydrology, climatic variations, biology, vegetation components, and impacts related to human activities.  In addition, existing levels of stream stability, stream profiles, bed features, and channel patterns must be considered when implementing structural changes to stream morphologies.  The adverse consequence of stream channel instability is associated with increased sediment supply, land productivity change, land loss, fish habitat deterioration, changes in both short and long-term channel evolution and loss of physical and biological function.  Dr. David L. Rosgen of Wildland Hydrology has developed many methods and theories for stream restoration and the development of permanent structures within stream channels.  While Dr. Rosgen's theories are widely known, only a select few geomorphologists and engineers are trained and certified to adequately implement his techniques.  Training in Dr. Rosgen's techniques is required to design permanent in-stream structures without negatively impacting the natural functioning condition of streams. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Project proposed award date is August 1, 2005.

The Parking Area is approximately 1200 long and the surface area is approximately 49,000 square feet. Crushed rock will be obtained from a commercial source.  Hot asphalt concrete will be obtained from a commercial source that provides hot asphalt concrete for County, State, and / or federal construction projects on a regular basis. A drainage ditch with an asphalt surfaced ford will be constructed to improve drainage in the Parking Area adjacent to an existing vault toilet.  A minor amount of excavation and embankment will be necessary prior to the placement of the crushed rock.****************

B. Full text of announcement

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) is soliciting proposals for a new program called Integrated Learning.  This program will develop computer software, called an Integrated Learner, that learns plans or processes from human users by being shown one example.  Sample applications include air-tasking-order (ATO) planning and CAD design planning.  Integrated Learners will learn from one example by opportunistically assembling knowledge from many different sources, including generating it by reasoning.  In addition to this BAA and before submitting proposals, a prospective offeror MUST refer to the Integrated Learning Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) located at the DARPA website, http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicitations/solicitations.htm for further information. The PIP contains additional details on the program objectives, technical issues, research questions, applications, program description, evaluation plans and metrics, general information, submission process, reporting requirements and procedures, proposal format, evaluation and funding processes, and administrative addresses.

I.  Funding Opportunity Description 

PROGRAM SCOPE DARPA. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art. Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered. However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications. 

II. Award Information 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.


III. Eligibility Information
1.  Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for Small Disadvantaged Business, HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.
2.  Cost Sharing or Matching
Cost sharing is not required for this particular program; however, cost sharing will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument (e.g., for any Technology Investment Agreement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371). 

IV. Application and Submission Information

1.  Address to Request Application Package

This announcement and the PIP contain all information required to submit a proposal.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.  [Note: see paragraph 6, “other submission requirements,” for reference to the PIP.]

2.  Content and Form of Application Submission
This BAA requires completion of an online Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission.  To do so, the offeror must go to http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=05-43  and follow the instructions there.  Each offeror is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal.  If an offeror intends to submit more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password must be used in creating each Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.
Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award.  If you choose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA.  

PROPOSAL FORMAT
Offerors must submit an original and 2 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk, or cd).  Mac-formatted disks will not be accepted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 05-43, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy number of 2.  
3.  Submission Dates and Times
The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (ET) September 14, 2005, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 05-43, Integrated Learning will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) July 11, 2006. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through July 11, 2006. While the proposals submitted after the September 14, 2005, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, offerors should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.
4.  Intergovernmental Review – N/A
5.  Funding Restrictions
Authorization of precontract costs will be considered in situations of genuine urgency where programmatic benefits will accrue from their use.
6.  Other Submission Requirements
Offerors must obtain the BAA 05-43 Offeror Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/solicitations.htm.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 05-43 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

V. Application Review Information

1.  Criteria (listed in descending order of relative importance): 

(1)	Overall Scientific and Technical Merit
(2)	Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem
(3)	Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience
(4)	Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition
(5)	Cost Realism and Project Management Plan

2.  Review and Selection Process
It is the policy of DARPA to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive evaluation of all proposals and to select the source (or sources) whose offer meets the Government’s technical and policy goals.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the above criteria which are detailed further in the PIP.

Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  DARPA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.
  
Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled for administrative purposes by support contractors.  These support contractors are prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are also bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  However, non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.   Use of non-government personnel is covered in FAR 37.203(d).


VI. Award Information Administration

1.  Award Notices

Principal Investigators will receive a letter informing them of the disposition of their proposal via U.S. mail.  

2.  Administrative and National Policy Requirements

Offerors may visit DARPA’s Contracts Management Office (CMO) website (http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/modelgrantagreement.htm) for model grant and cooperative agreement terms and conditions.

For Research Involving Human Subjects: 
Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the Department of Defense Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects.  This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards, and Federal Wide Assurances.  These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.
For proposals involving “greater than minimal risk” to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA.  For proposals that are forecasted to involve “greater than minimal risk” after the first year, a discussion on how and when the offeror will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).
DARPA has determined that work for this program is to be funded by budget category 6.2 (Applied Research). This means that research performed under this program on-campus at a university is considered contracted fundamental research; therefore, public releases of information about such research are not subject to prior Government review. The definition of CONTRACTED FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH is contained in DOD Instruction 5230.27 and can be found at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf2/i523027p.pdf. Public release of information about research performed under circumstances other than those described above is subject to prior government review, according to the procedures available at http://www.darpa.mil/tio.

3.  Reporting
The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Offeror Information Pamphlet (PIP).

The DARPA/CMO website referenced above also provides general information about reports required specifically for grants and cooperative agreements.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH has a requirement for the production of a Trivalent Recombinant Botulinum Vaccine for protection against serotyes A, B and E neurotoxins. This solicitation is being issued under full and open competitive procedures.  If selected for this requirement, the Contractor will conduct advanced process development activities necessary to produce and formulate in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) one lot of trivalent vaccine that demonstrates protective efficacy against types A, B and E botulinum neurotoxins. The development process shall include the following:  Developing and qualifying assays necessary to conduct FDA required nonclinical laboratory studies and stability testing; Preparing a clinical development plan; Submitting an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA; Conducting  a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a trivalent (ABE) recombinant botulinum vaccine candidate in healthy populations under a Contractor-held IND; and Preparing and submitting  reports for the Phase 1 clinical trial to NIAID.  The Contract for this effort will also include an option for the development of animal efficacy models to support the requirements of 21 CFR 314.600 and 21 CFR 601.90-95, Subpart H, “Approval of Biological Products When Human Efficacy Studies Are Not Ethical or Feasible,” and for testing of the candidate vaccine in these animal models. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will contain two Mandatory Qualification Criteria that must be met at the time of receipt of the original proposal submission and they are as follows:  Criterion 1 - Documented proof of access to starting materials and technologies suitable for the development and manufacture of the proposed candidate trivalent (ABE) botulinum neurotoxin vaccine:  a) If the offeror has ownership rights to the source materials and technologies, the offeror must represent that they possess those rights in a letter signed by an official legally authorized to bind the organization contractually, and b) If the offeror has negotiated access to the source materials and technologies through or from another party(ies), the offeror must represent that they have secured access to those materials and technologies in a letter signed by the officials legally authorized to contractually bind both the offeror’s organization and the other party(ies).  Criterion 2 - Given the timeline requirements for this vaccine development effort, it is essential that efforts funded as a result of this RFP build on the most advanced vaccine candidate(s). Therefore, offerors must provide data demonstrating the ability of each monovalent vaccine component for serotypes A, B and E to provide 100% protection against a lethal challenge from at least 1,000 mouse IPLD50 of a homologous serotype of botulinum neurotoxin in at least one standardized mouse protection bioassay.]  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 4-year period of performance beginning on or about September 1, 2006. This RFP will be available electronically on/about August 1, 2005, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to award of a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Notes 1 and 26.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for exclusive testing and data analysis of the Phase IV Prototype Cryogenic Mass Flow Sensor.  Completion of the Phase-IV testing will demonstrate a unique sensing capability for determining mass flow in multiphase cryogenic fluids via a direct density and fluid velocity measurement without violating the integrity of the fluid characteristics.  The cryogenic mass flow sensor would increase testing capabilities at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and possibly create a much improved flight sensor which would have wide range ramifications in propulsion testing, design and vehicle systems.  MSFC will be able to anchor the data for traditional computational fluid dynamic models for cryogenic systems.  Additional NASA cryogenic activities ranging from ground-based propulsion testing to on-orbit cryogenic fluid storage and transfer will benefit from this development. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the supplies and services from Madison Research Corporation. Madison Research Corporation has unique experience as they have developed the first three phases of the cryogenic mass flow sensor and were responsible for the testing and analysis of test data. The experience base Madison Research Corporation has obtained from previous testing greatly facilitates the continued development of the cryogenic mass flow sensor.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial services using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to increase the current level of effort under Contract PBGC01-CT-02-0630.  The contract includes the analysis, development and maintenance programming of approximately 16 PBGC custom-designed software applications.  This is a continuation of work already undertaken by the existing provider.  The increase in the level of effort is to accommodate the increase in workload resulting from the recent trusteeship of several small and large pension plans which has placed unforeseen demands on the efficiency and responsiveness of PBGC systems.  In view of the provider's familiarity with the complexities of PBGC, extensive systems experience with PBGC's environment, and the time already spent in learning the work and PBGC policies and procedures, it is PBGC's belief that it would be in our best interest for the current provider to continue performing the work under the contract.  This increase under the existing contract will ensure continuity of the work.  This is not a request for proposal.  See Note 22.

<CONTACT>Carol A. Axley Contracting Officer 4155614793     ;
<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS), Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) has a requirement for a Tree Management contractor to perform hazardous tree management to maintain the biological and structural health of historic trees at Fort Baker, Sausalito, Marin County, California. The majority of trees addressed in this project were planted between 1908 and 1941.  The Schedule of Work has been established by a professional arborist based on a detailed tree-by-tree survey of historic trees, roadside conditions, and the site management goals of the NPS.  The purpose of the tree management work along Bunker Road, Murray Circle and East Road is to maintain the biological and structural health of mature historic trees through crown reduction and pruning, support fire management projects, protect native oak trees from impact damage by equipment during road repaving operations in September 2005, and remove hazardous and non-historic trees.  Minimum qualifications for all pruning of trees to remain shall be performed under the standards established by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) by an ISA-certified arborist.  In addition, all removal of mature historic trees over 12-inches DBH must be done by a Licensed Professional Forester (LPF).  CONTRACTORS WHO SUBMIT QUOTES FOR THIS PROJECT WHO DO NOT MEET THESE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FURTHER FOR TECHNICAL EVALUATION.  Period of performance is from approximately September 2, 2005 through October 15, 2005.  Contractors bidding on this project must be able to complete the job within this time frame, because this is when the least amount of traffic occurs at Fort Baker and when road closures will have a minimal effect on park visitors.  Technical Evaluation Criteria are as follows:  1) Tree pruning expertise with mature eucalyptus trees for the purpose of improving their biological and structural health.  2)  Tree removal expertise for mature (minimum 100-foot tall) trees in a congested urban area where protection of adjacent trees and structures is required. 3)  Work site management on public lands that are open to and frequented by the general public; and 4) Safe and effective use of equipment and tools required for this project. Contractors are required to respond to these criteria with a technical proposal required for Technical Evaluation of experience, explaining their knowledge and demonstration of these requirements.  Contractors are also required to complete the Contractor Data Experience Sheets at Attachment No. 0004, providing descriptions and references for similar previously completed projects within the last 3 years.  The Government may contact these references to review: 1) the offeror's capability to perform the work, efficiency and effectiveness, 2) the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of the contract; 3) the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during the performance of the work, and 4) the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, the Government will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: Federal, state, and local government agencies, Better Business Bureaus, published media and electronic databases. This is not a sealed bid procurement, and therefore, the low bid is not necessarily awarded to the contractor providing that price. Award of this contract will be made to the Offeror whose offer contains the best overall value to the Government, which includes a combination of qualifications, technical expertise, past performance and price.  A site visit is scheduled for Tuesday, August 2, 2005 at 10:00A.M., meeting at Building 405, Fort Baker, Sausalito, CA.  Contractors are strongly encouraged to attend the site visit and tree walk with the Project Manager to get a better understanding of the Scope of Work and be able to provide the most advantageous price to the government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable for this procurement is 561730.  This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.  The National Park Service encourages the participation of small, minority and woman-owned business enterprises.  The Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be available on or about July 25, 2005 this website:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Responses are due no later than  Friday, August 12, 2005 at 2:00 P.M.

<DESC>Forest Service requires the removal of mine tailings from the Goldstone Mine. The Project consists of treating mine tailings at the Goldstone mine site and restoring a stream channel where the tailings are located.  Approximately 4,400 cubic yards of tailings are to be hauled and placed at an on-site repository.  The repository will then be capped with borrow material and riprap available on-site.  The tailings removal site, located in the Pratt Creek floodplain, will then be restored to a stable, naturally functioning stream channel by re-contouring the floodplain and establishing stream stabilization structures. The roads accessing the mine site and those to be used to haul tailings will need some minor clearing, excavation and drainage improvements.  An earthen and log dam and a culvert will be removed and used in the restoration work or placed at the repository.  Two temporary roads and support structures across wetlands will need to be constructed to access some of the tailings and will be obliterated after the removal is completed.  The road accessing the mine site will be restored to the original width upon completion of the contract.  The project is located on the Leadore Ranger District, Salmon-Challis National Forest, Lemhi County, Idaho.  The contract time will be 60 calendar days.  Work is estimated to start September 15, 2005.  Proposals are due at 3:00 p.m. MST, August 29, 2005.  The estimated price range is $100,000 to $250,000.  The solicitation will be available on approximately July 29, 2005, and can be downloaded from this site at that time.  All responsible vendors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database and have proper bonding capability before being eligible to submit a proposal under this solicitation.  You may register at www.ccr.gov.

<SUBJECT>H--Cold FTP Feasibility Testing
<SOLNBR>RFQ-OH-05-00150
<RESPDATE>072905
<ARCHDATE>08292005
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Tharp, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2092
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The U.S. EPA, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, Michigan intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mercedes Benz Service Corp. (MBSC) of Ann Arbor, Michigan to conduct Cold (FTP) Feasibility Testing for vehicles under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   Recent investigations into cold FTP test data has indicated that cold temperature hydrocarbon (HC) emissions from spark ignition (SI) light duty vehicles may be  much higher than originally estimated.  Current emission standards for cold temperatures (20 F) only require compliance for carbon monoxide (CO).  Lack of additional cold emission standards may result in delayed usage of hardware and/or control features normally used to reduce emissions at 75 F.   Additionally, current cold emissions modeling has not been confirmed with Tier 2 type vehicle systems, and lacks SI engine particulate matter (PM) relationships below 75 F.   MBSC will assist EPA in proving out hardware/calibration changes by testing vehicles, as close to sea-level as possible,  through emission testing and measurement at a cold test facility. EPA will deliver vehicles daily to the testing facility.  EPA will receive results from the daily testing and make adjustments to vehicles for the next day of testing based on results received.  Any necessary changes to test vehicle  systems that impact emissions will be performed by EPA personnel only.  MBSC will quantify current levels of emissions in Tier 2 type vehicles, by performing a baseline cold (20  F) FTP testing following normal Cold CO-type procedures. In addition to criteria pollutants, measurement of non-methane  organic gas (NMOG) and PM shall be required to assess specific levels of selected vehicles.  This information will also be used to supplement and improve current modeling assumptions.  After the baseline has been established, MBSC will conduct cold testing to assess the feasibility and impact of  vehicle controls. This would include testing the effect of activating existing hardware and/or software /calibration features currently used to meet the 75 F FTP emissions standards.  The specific approach will be dependent on the individual vehicles' baseline emissions performance and available  hardware and features. It has been determined that MBSC is the only firm able to provide Cold FTP Feasibility Testing because it is the only facility that could meet the cold temperature NMOG and PM analysis requirements close to sea-level and located within local access to the NVFEL Laboratory in  Ann Arbor,  Michigan.  Also, due to the experimental nature of the proposed testing program it will require EPA staff to modify and/or return the vehicles to NVFEL after completion of each individual test, in order to be able to make the necessary manual hardware and/or software calibration changes  that are indicated from a review of the test results.  Since the test program is expected to last 8 to 12 weeks and will require this daily vehicle transfer/modification, any arrangement to have the testing conducted at a distant laboratory that is not located near NVFEL would be unworkable from  logistics as well as from a cost standpoint. MBSC is the only known test facility able to satisfy both the Cold FTP Feasibility Testing requirements and logistical requirement of being located near NVFEL.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of  providing the services of Cold FTP Feasibility Testing within the Ann Arbor, Michigan area may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the  proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.   Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm fixed price award to Weiss Ratings, Inc., 15430 Endeavour Drive, Jupiter, Florida 33478.  The purpose of this award is for the contractor to provide Financial Data Related to Medicare Managed Care Contractors.  The financial data will be used as part of the Medicare Advantage Group’s (MAG) financial watchlist project.  Financial data related to the ability of the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) to meet their obligations to their enrollees is needed to support this project.  The purpose of MAG’s Financial Watchlist Project is to predict when a MAO may be at risk for leaving the program, either because the MAO no longer complies with the state’s requirements for fiscal soundness or has unprofitable or limited Medicare beneficiary enrollment. Weiss Ratings, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the financial data because it does more extensive verification and confirmation of the data.  Also, the GAO studies various vendors and found the ratings that Weiss develops based on the financial data it collects and verifies to be the most predictive of the ability of the rated organization to meet their enrollee obligations.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.  In addition, all potential contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration System (CCR) www.ccr.gov.

One of the POB studies is on the evaluation of the invitro cytotoxicity of a novel tubulin inhibitor ABT-751 in pediatric tumor cell lines.  The ACEA RT-CES allows the POB to screen cell lines from pediatric tumors providing continuous monitoring of cell growth in real-time.  The ACEA electronic measurement is non invasive and does not interfere with cell growth or assays.  The data is collected automatically and analyzed in real time throughout the experiment which allows the POB to model culture dynamics in assays for both conventional “cytotoxic” as well as in newly developed molecularly-targeted “cytostatic” drugs.  Acea Biosciences is the only known source to the NCI researcher that can provide the aforementioned equipment.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on July 22, 2005.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.

The Government intends to procure the HT1250 portable Two-Way Radios on a sole source basis from Motorola because Motorola does not have any authorized resellers and the Federal Government can only procure this radio through Motorola’s GSA Schedule GS-35F-0004L.

 The Government reserves the right to make a split award due to the fact that some items are exclusively available through Motorola’s GSA Schedule and others are open market.  
The open market items, which are not on the Federal Supply Schedule and are not upgrades or downgrades that come with the radio, are the 120 Volt 6 Unit Rapid Rate Intell-AAHTN3003D, the NIMH, 1800 MAH 7.5V Battery-INTR HNN9010 R and the HT1250 User Guide 6881088C37.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with Group One Software, a Pitney Bowes Company, 4200 Parliament Pl Ste 600, Lanham, MD 20706-1844, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.106-1 (b) (1) as the contracting officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract deem only once source reasonably available. Streamweaver Software is a print stream engineering tool that is used for document and data control. Streamweaver allows print-ready files from a variety of applications to be changed or re-purposed after they leave their applications without tying up mainframe resources or incurring large programming costs. Streamweaver allows SSA’s technical staff to modify job control language, generate extensible markup language, extract information from databases and perform reporting and auditing functions. The vendor (Group 1, a Pitney Bowes Company), owns all proprietary rights to the software's source code and is the only responsible sole source for maintenance, along with software upgrades; no other source can maintain the software or provide the relevant software upgrades. The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed purchase order for the maintenance and software license upgrades. Other organizations possessing the requisite expertise and resources are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, expertise, and other pertinent data. Pricing data may be submitted. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. This is not a request for quotation and the Government does not intend to pay for information received. If SSA does not identify other acceptable sources capable of providing the software maintenance and relevant upgrades, SSA shall issue a sole source award under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Responses to this notice should be submitted by July 29th, 2005. Request for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Oral communications are not acceptable.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Objective of Market Research Questionnaire:  In order to determine whether this requirement should be considered a commercial item for acquisition purposes and to incorporate industry best practices into the requirement,  US Army Contracting Command is acc omplishing market research. The information acquired from market research will be used to determine whether the requirement can be considered a commercial item.  A determination that the requirement is a commercial item allows the US Army to use Federal Ac quisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, acquisition policies and procedures, to procure the requirement.  This research will also help us ensure we write a Performance-Based Work Statement (PBWS) to the maximum extent possible. Commercial Item Definition: A commercial item, as defined in FAR 2.101, is an item that has the following qualities: Customarily used for non-government purposes.  Evolved from an item customarily used for non-governmental purposes and will be available on the commercial marketplace in time to satisfy the requirement, or an item that would satisfy a criterion expressed i n paragraphs (a) or (b) if modified.  Installation services, maintenance services, repair services, training services, and other services if such services are procured for support of an item referred to in the above paragraphs of this definition, and if th e source of such services: Offers such services to the general public and the Federal Government contemporaneously and under similar terms and conditions; and Offers to use the same work force for providing the Federal Government with such services as the source uses for providing such services to the general public.  Services of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based on established catalog or market prices for specific tasks performed under stand ard commercial terms and conditions.  This does not include services that are sold based on hourly rates without an established catalog or market price for a specific service performed. Questions: Please review the following questions and provide feedback/input you think would be relevant to planning the BOSS/BSS Solicitation and resultant contract.  Answering all questions  would be appreciated but is not mandatory; however, any input you provide will be considered prior to posting of the final Re quest For Proposal (RFP).  Please mark information that you wish to be protected as Acquisition Sensitive or Proprietary.   Questions: General   Does this requirement meet the criteria listed above for a commercial item?

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory located in Seattle, WA intends to acquire quantity of two each automated underway pC02 systems for delivery to NOAA PMEL Office by February15, 2006. The intended acquisition is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 234 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. Over the last decade the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory of NOAA has become a leader in the international effort to determine partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the world’s oceans.  In order to detect the small secular changes in ocean carbon fluxes, these global observations must be of the highest possible quality.  Only by the strictest attention to quality control, intercomparison, and the use of standard reference gases has the carbon community, as a whole, been able to reduce errors in pCO2 measurements. The quantitative assessment of the global mass balance of CO2 is a vital component of the Global Carbon Cycle Program. As part of a multi-year effort to quantify the flux of carbon dioxide between the ocean and atmosphere under NOAA's climate forcing portfolio, systems to measure partial pressure of CO2 are being placed on volunteer observing ships and research ships.  To date, the systems have been built in house.  Because of the increased scope of the effort, we seek a commercial vendor, General Oceanics, to build the units to exact and exacting specifications provided by PMEL and AOML (Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory).  To assure conformity these criteria are based on the four current systems operated by the PMEL/CO2 group and similar additional systems operated by AOML. General Oceanics has provided underway pCO2 systems for AOML in the past several years for the Sea Keepers program, part of the NOAA Global Carbon Cycle Program.  General Oceanics has been working to create pCO2 systems that meet the specifications of the pCO2 systems currently in use by PMEL and AOML.  The underway system must be capable of measuring atmospheric pCO2 to within ± 1 &#956;atm and surface ocean pCO2 to within ± 2 &#956;atm.  The system must be self-contained and portable.  It must be fully operational and include:  1) Equilibrator box for both air and seawater lines, filters, flow controllers, gas drying system, and temperature and pressure sensors; 2) Valve box that contains a Valco multi-position valve controlled by an onboard computer and interface electronics, and a Li-Cor IR analyzer to be supplied by the user.  The Valco multi-position valve must take a minimum of six gas lines for both standards and samples.  No other underway pCO2 system with these specifications can be purchased within the United States.  In order to maintain the statistical integrity of the data, it is critical that PMEL utilize the same system as AOML.  The Government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue a contract to  General Oceanics, Inc whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government, without further notice. Only firms that can provide the exact equipment described herein will be considered. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within ten (10) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206)526-6025, attention Maria Mendoza. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100, 000.00. ****The Western Regional Acquisition  Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003.  After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.  In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number. A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

Line items are availible on the soliciation document. 

A site survey for this solicitation was completed on 7 July 2005. Drawings of the facilities including highlighted areas where WLAN connectivity is needed, and placement of AP's have been posted. A Statement of Work has also been posted.


There have been many questions regarding CLIN 0010 and CLIN 0011. CLIN 0010 is a no cost ($0.00) software item that comes with CLIN 0006. It will remain as a separate clin, because it must be specified when CLIN 0006 is ordered from CISCO. CLIN 0011 has been verified by CISCO as a good part number.

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer – M. Lea McDaniel, SEA 02635, (202) 781-2928
<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is available on both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site located at http://www.eps.gov or http://www.fedbizopps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare - Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Program Office (PMS 403), Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC, is soliciting new and innovative concepts in the development and demonstration of technologies applicable to UUVs. The growing use of unmanned systems in the air, on the ground, or underwater continually demonstrates new possibilities/capabilities to maintain our naval forces’ maritime superiority around the world. One can conceive scenarios where UUVs sense, track, identify, target, and destroy an enemy -- all autonomously within the full net-centric battlespace. The long-term UUV vision is to have the capability to (1) deploy or retrieve devices; (2) gather, transmit, and act on all types of information; and (3) engage bottom, volume, surface, air or land targets.  To this end, the Navy is soliciting proposals in the following areas:  (1)	Autonomy. Autonomy is needed to support long, complex missions in unpredictable or harsh environments. It includes the need to make independent decisions based on the mission goals, environmental conditions, and remaining energy on-board. Additional needed capabilities include the need to avoid obstacles and entanglements, to react to changes in ambient conditions, and to engage in group behavior when multiple UUVs act as a team.  (2)	Energy and Propulsion. Low-cost, high energy density, reliable, safe, long-duration easily recharged or refueled power sources are needed. Energy source for air-independent power is desired to minimize the size, cost, and signature of the energy and propulsion system. Advanced energy and propulsion, in combination with other UUV technologies, will enable the use of smaller vehicles that reduce cost in the long term while providing greater performance.  (3)	Advanced Sensors and Sensors Processing. All UUV missions depend on the effective use of sensors. Development in the sensor area needs to be concentrated in increasing area coverage rate (ACR), improving classification and identification capabilities, employment and packaging of low-power electronics, non-traditional tracking techniques, and multi-threat chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological, and explosive (CBNRE) sensors.  (4)	Communications and Networking. Real-time, or near real-time, RF communications of sensor data from the vehicle in operational sea states is needed. Acoustic or other (e.g. laser) underwater communication technologies to provide communications at useful data rates and provide navigation aids on demand are desired.  (5)	Launch and Recovery. Launch and Recovery (L&R) is a key feature of any UUV system, and it is closely related to the vehicle size and host platform characteristics. Development of innovative multi-platform L&R concepts, as well as deployment and possible recovery of payloads from host UUV, are desired.     (6)	Engagement and Intervention. The development of technology is necessary to support net extraction. Engagement and intervention techniques are required for a wide range of missions, particularly those requiring long transits and interactions with targets. The UUV missions envisioned may require solutions that range from non-lethal to neutralization.  (7)	Modeling and Simulation. Modeling and simulation are needed for UUV mission planning and reconstruction, vehicle testing, software design and testing, and training. This BAA will be open for one year from the date of the announcement. Proposals may be submitted at any time within that period.  Contracts and “other transactions” may be awarded, as appropriate, and will be limited by funding availability. Therefore, early submission of proposals is desirable and encouraged. Navy evaluation will commence after 1 March 2005 and initial awards are anticipated in third quarter FY05. Proposals should be submitted to: COMMANDER, Naval Sea Systems Command, ATTN: Code 02635, M. Lea McDaniel, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, S.E., Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC 20376.  Contracting Point of Contact is M.

Because both the technical and cost aspects of an offeror's submission will be evaluated at the same time, it is desirable that one volume containing all information be submitted. In presenting the proposal material, prospective offerors are advised that quality of the information is significantly more important than the quantity. Therefore, offerors are requested to confine their submissions to essential matters, providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation. Offerors may submit their proposals (two paper copies and ten electronic copies on CD using Microsoft Office 2000 or earlier).  Respondents must be able to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance to meet the security requirements of work proposed, and key personnel must be certified as holding an appropriate clearance. Proposals shall consist of one volume consisting of the technical proposal, management approach, and!  cost. The technical proposal is limited to 20 pages exclusive of the Statement of Work (paragraph (7), below) and cost information, which has no page limit. Pages are to be 8.5 x 11 inch, single-sided. Minimum font is 10 point. Succinct proposals are desired.  The technical portion shall consist of the following sections, each starting on a new page:  (1) A cover page, including proposal title, technical and administrative points-of-contact along with the telephone and facsimile numbers, followed by a letter signed by the authorized officer specifying the proposal validity period (at least 120 days); (2) An Executive Overview of the proposed technologies and/or concepts as well as any innovative claims for the proposed research, and how they will contribute to and support the objectives of a technology evaluation and demonstration; (3) A detailed technical proposal of the primary precepts of the concept with appropriate elaboration as to the ingenuity associated with the co! ncept. This section shall not exceed 10 pages. (4) A summary of the deliverables including data associated with the proposed research. (5) A summary of the schedule and milestones for the proposed effort that can be traced to the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). (6) A one-page WBS. (7) A succinct Statement of Work clearly detailing the scope and objectives of the work and, if any, specific contractor requirements. The statement of work should only document the specific work to be performed as discussed in section (3) above. Any disclosure of information as relating to the merits of the concept included in the Statement of Work but not included in the detailed technical proposal required by paragraph (3) above will not be considered for award selection. If any portion of the proposed effort is predicated upon the use of Government-owned resources of any type, the contractor shall clearly identify: the resources required, the date the resource is required, the duration of the r! equirement, the source from which the resource may be acquired, if known, and the impact on the effort if the resource is not provided. (8) A description of the results, products, and transferable technology expected from the contract. This section should specifically address any intellectual property claims associated with the outcome of this effort. (9) A brief discussion of past performance detailing previous accomplishments and work in this or closely related research areas, previous cost and schedule performance, and the qualifications of the previous key personnel. (10) A brief discussion of the overall approach to the management of this effort, including brief discussions of total organization, use of personnel and their qualifications, project/function/subcontractor relationships, technology transition plans, government interfaces, and planning, scheduling, and control practices. The cost portion shall include the one-page work breakdown structure, a cost summary, an! d a detailed breakdown of cost for the effort. The selection of proposals for contract award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds. Specific evaluation criteria are as follows:  (1)	Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to PMS403 programs are proposed, their feasibility, and the offeror's understanding of the proposed approach and technical objectives. It is desirable that the developments be structured in phases to allow assessment and/or decision points, where allowable;  (2)	The offeror's ability to implement the proposed approach as demonstrated by specific accomplishments in the technical field to be studied, the qualifications (including past performance) of the proposed principal investigator and other personnel, and the availability of appropriate facilities;  (3)	The degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed contract are to be delivered to NAVSEA with rights compatible with NAVSEA research and development objectives; and (4)	The extent to which offerors identify and commit to small businesses and to small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, women-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institution participation in the proposed effort, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor relationship.

<RESPDATE>012606
<CONTACT>Contracting Officer – M. Lea McDaniel, SEA 02635, (202) 781-2928
<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is available on both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site located at http://www.eps.gov or http://www.fedbizopps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare - Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Program Office (PMS 403), Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC, is soliciting new and innovative concepts in the development and demonstration of technologies applicable to UUVs. The growing use of unmanned systems in the air, on the ground, or underwater continually demonstrates new possibilities/capabilities to maintain our naval forces’ maritime superiority around the world. One can conceive scenarios where UUVs sense, track, identify, target, and destroy an enemy -- all autonomously within the full net-centric battlespace. The long-term UUV vision is to have the capability to (1) deploy or retrieve devices; (2) gather, transmit, and act on all types of information; and (3) engage bottom, volume, surface, air or land targets.  To this end, the Navy is soliciting proposals in the following areas:  (1)	Autonomy. Autonomy is needed to support long, complex missions in unpredictable or harsh environments. It includes the need to make independent decisions based on the mission goals, environmental conditions, and remaining energy on-board. Additional needed capabilities include the need to avoid obstacles and entanglements, to react to changes in ambient conditions, and to engage in group behavior when multiple UUVs act as a team.  (2)	Energy and Propulsion. Low-cost, high energy density, reliable, safe, long-duration easily recharged or refueled power sources are needed.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 336212   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The NAICS code is 336212.  The specifications for the 18 Foot Enclosed Trailer is listed below:   Amendment #1 (Technical Questions)     18 Foot Enclosed Cargo Trailer I have a few specific questions.  My interpretation of the RFQ includes 6 floor mounted  tie downs (each with 5000 lb. rating) and an E- track system, which allows other attachments to be used anywhere along the track.  Do you want E tack on both the floor and the walls, or only on the walls (including the front wall)?  Do you also need wall track on the side access door?  Response:  Track system should be on the 2 side walls and the front wall of the trailer. The track system should not be on the side door. Regarding the awning, the RFQ indicates the awning should span from the back of the trailer to the side door.  Do you mean the rear edge or the front edge of the door (ie  do you want the awning to cover the door)?  In either case, how far back from the front of the trailer do you want the side door (one foot is the minimum; we can place it anywhere in front of the axles)? Response: The awning should run to the rear edge of the side door. The front edge of the side  door should be between 24 and 30 inches from the front of the trailer and it should be a standard size door of approximately 38 inches in width by at least 6 foot high. How many outlets do you want and at what location?  Response: Power outlets, three interior and three exterior.  Interior  outlets: The trailer requires three interior 110/120 20 amp duplex outlets. Two of the interior outlets should be on the passenger side up high off the floor by the flood lights which are located on the exterior of the trailer. The exterior flood lights should be as high on the passenger side of  the trailer as possible within approximately 1 foot of the front and back of the trailer. Exterior Outlets: The trailer requires three exterior 110/120 20 amp duplex outlets. Two of the outlets should be located on the passenger side of the trailer below the exterior halogen lights (approximately  1 foot from the front and 1 foot from the rear of the trailer) at floor level (one by each light).  The third exterior 110/120 20 amp duplex outlet should be located within approximately one foot of the rear of the trailer on the driver's side. I am not understanding the tie down system, track  system or tie rings or both?  Are you requesting an E-track or A-track system? Response: Requesting an E-track system Does the trailer really need a 100 amp service?  That seems like a lot, could we get by with a 50 amp service. Because then I could provide the shoreline cable, but not with the  100 amp, to much liability. Response:  50 amp service is acceptable.   The due date for quote submission remains 07/21/2005.

<DESC>The Government intends to include Kaba-Ilco key card access system into the solicitation for Project Number 52263, Whole Barracks Renewal, Buildings 550 and 551, Quad E, Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii.  This electronic key card access system has th e following salient performance features and characteristics  expandable, electronics and batteries are housed inside the room protecting them from the environment, hidden mechanical override and removable core, visual and audible operation indicators, op erates on standard batteries, event audit trail tracking, real time system, resists forcible entry even though outside level is twisted off, meets ANSI/BHMA grade 1 requirements for lever torque test, and has a 2 year exterior durable and scratch resistant  finish fully guaranteed for two years against tarnishing. Quad E is composed of four buildings designated to support the administrative and billet needs of the 3rd Brigade.  Renovation of these facilities is being accomplished in two phases.  The first phase (Buildings 549 and 552) is under construction and Kalba  Ilco is providing the electronic card key system.  The second phase (Buildings 550 and 551) are scheduled for construction award this year. Per recommendations of Engineering and Construction Bulletin, No. 2005-1, 18 March 2005, the Directorate of Public Works (DPW) has implemented a plan to ensure consistency, compatibility, and sustainability for electronic key card access systems for USAG-H I installations.  Electronic key card access systems have become a standard feature for new construction and major renovation projects such as those under the Whole Barracks Renewal Program.  Facilities impacted include barracks as well as administrative f acilities.  This would avoid a proliferation of different brands of key card access systems, minimize/consolidate spare parts and stock, and establish a team of well trained maintenance experts.  To sustain these objectives, the phase 2 construction (Build ings 550 and 551) should provide Kalba Ilco brand electronic card key system to: (1) Ensure consistency within the Quad  one system for the 3rd Brigade to program and manage; (2) Ensure compatibility with the system installed in Buildings 549 and 552; (3)  Ensure maintainability and serviceability expertise by DPW staff; and (4) Proven durability and performance of systems installed to date. Utilization of another card access system would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Any interested contractors shall respond by August 29, 2005.

<DESC>The Government does not require another satellite or satellite services equivalent to the UFO constellationâ€™s F11.  However, the Government will use the F11 capabilities as a reference point when considering qualification packages submitted by interested parties.  Each interested party shall describe the range of its qualifications from the extent of UHF capabilities available at its earliest delivery date (month and year)  via its lowest risk (technical and schedule)/most affordable solution to providing the equivalent capability of the UFO F11 no later than December 2009 with the related risk level (technical and schedule) and rough order of magnitude (ROM) price. An interested partyâ€™s lack of qualification to provide any UHF capability no later than December 2008 or the equivalent capability of the UFO F11 no later than December 2009 does not exclude its qualification package from consideration by the Government.  However, the Government will NOT consider qualification packages that fail to include providing  UHF capability NLT December 2009. THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, but rather this is a sources sought synopsis in order for the Government to identify interested sources that are capable of providing these narrowband military communications satellite efforts.  The purpose of this sources sought is to identify potential prime sources that: (1)   can adequately demonstrate their current capabilities; and (2)   have a detailed plan of action that shows the ability to meet satellite capability service requirements within the desired (NLT December 2008) and required (NLT December 2009) timelines. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized under separate cover on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  The information requested herein will be used to support a potential solicitation issued in 4th quarter FY05 or 1st quarter FY06 that will result in a contract award as early as the end of the 2nd quarter of FY06.  All information provided below is for planning purposes and is subject to change. The satellite, whether already produced or to be produced, must be designed for stabilization in geosynchronous orbit to ensure that the antennas are constantly maintained in an earth pointing orientation.  The spacecraft must provide the necessary power to support the mission requirements during those periods when the satellite is in eclipse.  The spacecraft must provide the essential support functions for the control of the communications payload, and must accommodate and provide essential support functions for operation of the Communications Security (COMSEC) Equipment used for TT&C. If yet to be launched, the spacecraft must provide propulsive energy for the post launch vehicle deployment/separation impulse to inject the satellite into geosynchronous orbit and thereafter to maintain that orbit and the proper orientation for the satellite design life.  The TT&C equipment must provide all necessary functions for the control of the satellite and communications payload.  The satellite must be designed for a commercial launch by a Contractor- provided national launch service. Any prime sources (i.e. prime contractor or contracting teams) shall reply to this synopsis if they are interested in proposing for this potential narrowband satellite communications contract.  Interested offerors shall submit qualification packages generally describing their capabilities and satellite designs for meeting this requirement.  Packages shall be in the form of a narrative statement not exceeding 10 face pages double-spaced and a slide presentation (e.g., MS PowerPoint) not exceeding 25 slides.  Interested offerors shall submit their qualification packages via the SPAWAR E-commerce website to the SPAWAR contracts point of contact, Ms. Kim Mallis.  Replies should be submitted by 4:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on Monday, July 28th, 2005.  After reviewing the responses, Government may contact a prime source for a live presentation (telecon, VTC, or in-person, not to exceed 90 minutes) of its response.  Any live presentations, if requested, must be made no later than August 4th, 2005. This is NOT a request for proposals. Proprietary data in responses will be protected where so designated.  All respondents should indicate their company size status and the extent to which they can include small business participation (of all small business categories listed in FAR 19.7).   If proposing a solution yet to complete manufacturing, the contractor size status is based on NAICS Code 334220 with an SBA size standard of 750 employees.  If proposing a solution that in involves services only, the contractor size status is based on NAICS Code 517410 with an SBA size standard of $12.5M.  Partnering between small and large businesses is encouraged.  Responses received in reply to this notice may, in part, be used to make a determination of the level of competition for the resulting solicitation (e.g., full and open competition, SB set-aside, 8(a) set- aside, etc.). Given the potential size and complexity of the proposed satellite utilized to fulfill the performance requirement, the Navy expects that the qualification packages submitted will describe the mature satellite design (whether satellite is already built or not) including: 1) define the satellite architecture to be used to meet the performance requirements and affordability constraints at verifiable and acceptable levels of risk; 2) describe the specifics of the system production, deployment, and operations processes; 3) identify key technical risk items and key cost drivers and demonstrate how they will be managed; 4) if the satellite to be used is not already in orbit, demonstrate the capability to achieve operation in orbit by December 2009 [or earlier depending on the solution(s) addressed in your qualification package]; 5) provide spacecraft information including satellite size, weight and power breakdowns to the payload and bus unit level with sufficient detail to demonstrate how spacecraft weight and power consumption estimates and margins were derived; technical descriptions of key spacecraft hardware and software components such as antennas, deployment mechanisms, feeds, filters, receivers, transmission lines, processors, and transmitter subsystems; and spacecraft reliability estimates to show that all performance requirements will be met; 6) technical descriptions of UHF payload in adequate depth to clearly demonstrate requirements satisfaction; signal analysis showing attainment of critical technical parameters such as gain, noise figure, dynamic range, linearity, efficiency, isolation, Gain to Noise Temperature (G/T), Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), intermodulation products, out of band emissions, signal processing, and any other key technical parameters affecting performance; 7) bus architecture information including functional block diagrams of the satellite bus and technical descriptions of key bus subsystems that clearly demonstrate requirements satisfaction; technical descriptions of all key bus subsystems including power, attitude control, propulsion, TT&C, thermal control and any other bus subsystems required for proper spacecraft operation; and 8) a ROM price (by Government fiscal year) for providing the UHF capability and, if satellite not yet on orbit, delineate the portion of the ROM price attributed to the launch effort.  If an interested party believes its solution to meeting the Governmentâ€™s requirements does not meet the FAR 2.101 definition of â€œcommercial itemâ€ and that FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items does not apply, it shall state so, provide the rationale for such interpretation, and clearly specify its qualification package is based on an acquisition using FAR Part 15 and what contract type. The UFO F11 Performance Specification is available upon request with proper security credentials.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM), on behalf of the Program Executive Office Space Systems and its Communications Satellite Program Office (PMW-146), is seeking to identify responsible prime sources (i.e. prime contractor or contracting teams) that can provide narrowband Military Communications (MILCOM) satellite services.   At a minimum, these Ultra- High Frequency (UHF) capabilities shall be provided no later than (NLT) December 2009 with availability for use through five (5 years) thereafter, and must be interoperable with current military UHF terminals and telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C) system. It is important to note that the Government prefers such capabilities to be provided NLT December 2008. Accordingly, the Government requires that any interested party identify the earliest availability date it can provide any UHF capabilities (even if after December 2008 yet prior to the minimum requirement date of NLT December 2009). A duplicate version of this sources sought synopsis is available at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. (Click on the â€œHeadquartersâ€ folder for Headquarters, then the â€œMarket Surveysâ€ link, then the â€œAdditional UHF Capabilitiesâ€ folder.) Efforts may include producing, launching into geosynchronous orbit, and placing into operation a new satellite.  The U.S. Navy is considering the use of FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and possibly service- based only (leasing) acquisitions. Please note that the Government will consider UHF services from satellites that may contain other bandwidth (e.g., C-band) channels for other customers, provided that priority consideration is given to meet UHF service needs. The UHF Follow-On (UFO) constellation, procured from Boeing Satellite Systems, Inc. (Los Angeles, CA) under contract N00039-88-C-0300, currently provides the warfighter its narrowband communications needs.  For reference, the last satellite (F11) added to the UFO constellation has a design lifetime of 14 years and a payload with 41 channels:  one (1) broadcast channel of 25 kHz bandwidth; 17 relay channels of 25kHz bandwidth; and 23 narrowband channels of 5 kHz bandwidth; plus one (1) EHF uplink and downlink channel for commanding the spacecraft.  The warfighter also uses additional UHF capabilities from G2 Satellite Solutions Corporation (Long Beach, CA) under the LEASAT services contract N00039-05-C-0022. The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) constellation, currently being procured from Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (Sunnyvale, CA) under contract N00039-04-C-2009, is the next generation narrowband Military Satellite Communications system that will replace the UFO system.   Operational availability of the first MUOS satellite is scheduled for March 2010 with final satellite delivery scheduled for March 2014. The Government does not require another satellite or satellite services equivalent to the UFO constellationâ€™s F11.  However, the Government will use the F11 capabilities as a reference point when considering qualification packages submitted by interested parties.  Each interested party shall describe the range of its qualifications from the extent of UHF capabilities available at its earliest delivery date (month and year)  via its lowest risk (technical and schedule)/most affordable solution to providing the equivalent capability of the UFO F11 no later than December 2009 with the related risk level (technical and schedule) and rough order of magnitude (ROM) price.

<DESC>We are looking for a system that will provide a rather large (about 20 miles), perimeter style surveillance capability that, when a breach of the perimeter is detected, it causes an optical device to provide the ability for someone at a central monit oring station to visually assess the breach.  This system would be akin to a virtual fence and should have the capability to be permanently situated, mounted on vehicles, or be manportable.  Connectivity to a central monitoring station should be redund ant using hard wire, fibre optic cable, or possibly RF.  All options are plausible at this point, but costs will drive the final decision.  System must be capable of operating in all weather conditions, to include extremely high heat and wind conditions. The proposed system should be able to be programmed to fit the changing requirements for security levels, and provide:1)excellent all weather and wind condition capabilities, 2)be able to provide relatively broad coverage, 3)have a scan rate related to the  area and range of area to be covered, 4)capability to scan and provide assessment visual monitoring of potential targets at long ranges,5)possess pan-and-tilt capabilities, both programmed in to the automatic scan/assess mode, 6) controllable from the cen tral monitoring station. If you have a solution for this problem, please submit information on your solution, not to exceed 25 pages and your estimated price for a 20-mile perimeter to Mr. Rick Koehler, U.S. Army Garrison - White Sands, WSMR, NM 88002.  His email address is richar d.koehler@wsmr.army.mil. Concepts must be received by 2:00 pm MDT on 25 July 2005.  Concepts will be evaluated to determine their feasibility and their affordability.  Vendors may be asked to provide a product demonstration.

CDM is the only holder of the EIQC and the upper contract ceiling has been reached.  As part of the SOW, CDM was requested to prepare an engineer’s estimate for the drilling work which includes the drilling and installation of monitoring wells and pilot boreholes, and well rehabilitation activities.

<SUBJECT>B -- NPOESS IGS Program
<DESC>OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  
The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) is a satellite system used to monitor global environmental conditions, and collect and disseminate data related to: weather, atmosphere, oceans, land and the near-space environment.  The NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) organizationally resides within the Department of Commerce, NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS).  The Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), created the IPO to develop, acquire, manage, and operate the NPOESS satellites.  Details on NPOESS can be found at http://npoess.noaa.gov.
The NPOESS requirements were developed by the user community and are captured in the NPOESS Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD).  To achieve its mission, the IPO has undertaken a far-reaching program of sensor development, and satellite transition and evolution to provide complete coverage of environmental conditions for civil, military, and scientific purposes.  NPOESS data will be processed into Environmental Data Records (EDRs) for use by a number of operational communities.  The IPO’s operational effectiveness depends on its ability to keep pace with rapidly developing technologies.  To accomplish this, the IPO funds research and development initiatives through its Internal Government Studies (IGS) program.
The IGS program consists of teams of scientists and engineers from Government laboratories and centers, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers, universities, and industry.  These teams are tasked to identify and test technologies and techniques that are able to meet NPOESS requirements and objectives.  The objective of this BAA is to identify and engage research organizations in industry and universities that can make significant technical contributions to NPOESS in the following areas:
•    Un-accommodated Environmental Data Records (EDRs) are remote sensing data products envisioned in the IORD that will not be produced by the NPOESS system (satellite and sensors) currently under development. Reasons for these deficiencies are lack of scientific understanding of the physical processes and measurements to be made, technological immaturity of the potential sensors, or the high cost of sensors using current technology. The IGS program sponsors continuing research directed toward the affordable satisfaction of these IORD requirements 
•    Environmental Data Record performance attainment:  The performance of the NPOESS sensors providing EDRs typically fall between the minimum threshold and desired objective levels of performance described in the IORD.  The IGS program sponsors continuing research into methods, techniques and science needed to advance EDR performance toward objective levels 
•    Data Exploitation and New Product Development:  NPOESS represents a significant advance in the United States’ operational environmental remote sensing capability.  While the system was designed to meet specific application requirements, it is expected that entirely new, novel, and potentially unanticipated useful applications will be discovered.  The IGS program sponsors development of applications to enhance exploitation of existing data products and the development of new data products.
•    Pre-Launch instrument assessment:  The instruments that will be carried on NPOESS and NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) spacecraft in many cases have advanced the state of the art in remote sensing technology.  It is critical that the performance of these instruments is completely and reliably characterized prior to launch.  The IGS program endeavors to stimulate vigorous scientific process to insure that this goal is achieved.
•    Post-Launch Calibration and Validation:  The data products generated by the NPOESS program will serve a very wide range of users, from long term climatological studies to operational civil and military forecasting.  The IGS program intends to fund research, development, analysis, and assessment activities to ensure that NPOESS data have been validated with rigor by a broad scientific community. 
•    Truth data development and sustainment:  Successful calibration and validation of NPOESS and NPP data products require various independent truth data sets of phenomena estimated from the raw satellite data.  The IGS program intends to fund activities necessary to ensure that sufficient data are available.  These will include assessment of the quality of existing data sources, research and development of methods, and techniques for data that are uniquely required by the program, and data collection campaigns. 
•    Development of Innovative Technologies that may help to enable the NPOESS mission: These technologies may be used in support of the above areas or to achieve efficiencies in NPOESS ground and space segment systems such as data handling, communications, sensor pointing, precision orbit/attitude determination, power management, etc.

PROGRAM SCOPE: The scope of this program is intentionally broad to address the wide spectrum of issues facing the next generation of polar-orbiting environmental remote sensing satellites.  All research is intended to have the common objective of addressing the technology issues described above.  Strategically, this research will support the establishment of the NPOESS family of environmental remote sensing satellite resources as a valid source for climate and operational environmental monitoring and forecasting in the future.
EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria in descending order of importance: (1) Capabilities and experience of the offeror, specifically with technology directly related to NPOESS,  (2) Contributions/ Relevance to the NPOESS Mission, (3) Plans and Capabilities to Accomplish Technology Transfer from a research environment to the NPOESS program , and (4) Total Cost and Cost Reasonableness.  All awards made in response to this BAA will be subject to availability of Government funds. Contract award(s) will be made on the basis of the evaluation criteria listed above to the offeror(s) whose proposals are considered most advantageous to the NPOESS IPO. 
GENERAL INFORMATION: IPO budgets approximately $8M per year for IGS contracts. IPO intends to award multiple IDIQ task order contracts ranging in value from $100K to $5M with one base year and up to four (4) option years (total of 5 years). Offerors should prepare proposals that anticipate an initial task order with a period of performance not longer than 12 months valued under $1M. This BAA will remain open for a period of one year. The selection process may begin as early as August 15, 2005.
Offerors must submit an original proposal and five (5) copies with a minimum of five (5) pages not to exceed ten (10) pages in length consisting of both technical and cost proposals to the administrative address for this BAA.  It is the policy of IPO to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  Non-Government personnel may be used for evaluation support.  Any such non-Government personnel are required to sign non-disclosure statements prior to participating in the evaluation. By submission of a proposal in response to this announcement, the offeror gives its written permission that its proposal information may be disclosed to those selected non-Government personnel for the evaluation of its proposal. 
Only Government evaluators will make selections under this BAA. This announcement constitutes the Broad Area Announcement as contemplated by FAR 35.016.  A formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Awards are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any other IPO contracts through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number. Affirmation shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission.

<SUBJECT>U--OA&MM National Acqusition Center 2005 Industry Conference
<DESC>Announcing the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Acquisition & Materiel Management National Acquisition Center's 2005 "THRIVING THROUGH PARTNERSHIP" Industry Conference! Dear Business Partner: Over the years, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management National Acquisition Center (NAC) has hosted a number of industry conferences to forge strong business relationships with the pharmaceutical, medical/surgical supply and equipment industries. This year, we're making VA's Industry Conference even more effective by making it more comprehensive and interactive. To do this, we NEED your participation and voice. Because we believe that an exchange of views with our business partners enhances the relationships between our customers, contractors, and the Federal government, this year's conference will feature a larger, general "meet & greet" session right up front, an interactive town hall style open forum and smaller, targeted meet & greet sessions throughout each day. The purpose of this year's conference will be to hear from you about the effectiveness of our acquisition programs as well as to provide insight into VA's Health Care acquisition process, programs and new initiatives. We invite you to participate in this two day Industry Conference entitled, "Thriving through Partnership" on Monday, October 3rd and Tuesday, October 4th at the Chicago Marriott O'Hare Hotel, 8535 W. Higgins Road, Chicago, IL. For more information on the hotel and to make room reservations, visit our NAC website at www.va.gov/oamm/nac or go to www.va.gov/vastorenac and click on "What's new". There is no charge for this conference. The conference will convene at 8:30 AM on October 3rd and conclude at approximately 12:15 p.m. on October 4th, 2005. If you and/or other representatives of your company would like to attend this conference, please complete the form at the bottom of this letter and return it to: VA National Acquisition Center, Attn: Conference (049A1) via email to NAC@med.va.gov or you may fax it to (708) 786-4975 no later than August 30, 2005.

HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION REGULATION (48 CFR CHAPTER 30) CLAUSES

3052.209-70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]
 (a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of clause)

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-851) 2100 2nd Street, SW Room 2606 Washington D. C. 20593 Telephone: (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.   The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.   Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.   Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG851), 2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C., 20593, Telephone:  202-267-2285

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for an electron-beam evaporator is to be used in an existing glass jar-type vacuum chamber (18" diameter), made by Veeco.  It can accommodate 1" bolt-style feedthroughs only (not con-flat). The source component, or e-gun, is capable of focusing an electron beam on one of four crucibles (7cc each) of metal to evaporate that metal onto a substrate in the line-of-sight.  Crucible liners are also needed that are compatible with the metals we are like to use: three vitreous (or glassy) carbon liners and three alumina liners are required. Accessories for the e-gun include a compatible (5.5kv to 10kV) power supply to generate the electron beam, a seep controller for sweeping the electron beam over the sample, and a 1" bolt style feedthrough kit for installing the system into the existing chamber.  The feedthrough kit must have the following (or equivalent): two high voltage feedthroughs, one cooling water feedthrough (supply and return), one "octal" feedthrough for sweep controle, and one rotary feedthrough to select the crucible to be used.  A crucible indexer is needed for clarity of operation and for ease of source selection.  A remote control option is also desired.

<CONTACT>Mary Pat Hayes-Crow, Logistics Management Specialist, Phone 2027768373, Fax 2027768775, Email hayes-crowmp2@state.gov
<DESC>Deadline is extended until July 27, 2005.   The following provides answers to questions received:

1.  There is the requirement to be able to intercept 32 analog pairs which would be the same as traditional pen register/dial number recorder based intercepts.  Additionally, the requirement to support an E-1 input with 30 digital channels for digital recording makes sense.  The statement under Description:..."30 fiber optic intercepts over an E-1"..is not clear..  

Ans. The requirement is for the system to handle 30 simultaneous digital lines over and E1 and 32 analog intercepts on the traditional analog channels.  

2. Is this a 3rd requirement to have some probe put into the hard line phone switching network that functions similar to an analog slave only on fiber optic lines, or are you simply reiterating that the system needs to be able to allow for the input of one E-1 with 30 digital channels?  

Ans. There is no 3rd requirement.  

3.  Also, do you know if the hard line network in Bogotá, Colombia has implemented a CALEA access/delivery solution like the TIA-J-STD-025 in the United States, or are you only looking for older, traditional analog methods of interception for the hard line phone network? 

 Ans. This has nothing to do with CALEA and will not interface with any CALEA type program.  We are not relying on J standard or on a network in either situation and would have to be completely flexible in terms of carrier/provider and formats.  

4. Could you please clarify what the total number of lines are that 
the system must  intercept simultaneously.  Is the number 30, 32 or 62?

Ans. System requirements are for 30 simultaneous digital lines over and E1 and 32 analog intercepts on the traditional analog channels.

5. The digital intercept function refers to an E1 trunk for 30 digital channels.  There are many types of E1 signaling.   What type of E1 signaling is required for this project ?  Can you provide an interface specification ?

Ans. DTMF/Caller ID Detection


6. The RFQ states "The offerors must provide a completed SF 1449."   Will you be issuing an SF 1449 form to all offerors 

Ans. Offerors shall submit an SF 1449 with the offeror information only.  The Government portion will be completed at award.  

7.  Re: past performance, could you please confirm whether description of previous projects with similar requirements is sufficient, or do you require Customer names and contact information (tel#'s, e-mail addresses)?
 
Ans. Please provide both.

8. “Semi-Portable” – what does it mean? (i.e. weight limits, type of case, external monitor)

Ans.  Semi-portable translates to:  This equipment will be located in clandestine locations and space is a premium.  We are looking for something that is transportable and also removable in-case the office space needs to vacated quickly.  We do not want a large, permanent rack-mount system.  

9.  What kind of power supply is needed? (battery operational, AC, combination of battery/AC) 

Ans.  AC/110v

10. Should the solution support additional external Playback stations? (If yes – how many?)

Ans.  1 or 2.  There will be a limited number of workstations and probably a singe user interface or in most cases no more than one or two users at the same time.

11.  .  Does the solution require on-line playback?

Ans.  Yes, needs to be real time.

12.  Does the recorder require remote-control? (ex. LAN protocol, telephone line)

Ans.  No
13.  Should we implement capture and visualization of fax communication?

Ans.  Not required.  

14.  What kind of data backup mechanism should be supported?
• Local (CD, DVD, MO, local HD)
Or
• Remote (LAN network server or workstation)

Ans.  DVD

15.    What kinds of signal levels are being transmitted over the analog lines or targets “copper pairs”?  

Ans.  DTMF/Caller ID Detection

16.  Type of connection on analogue lines – high impedance (parallel connection) or terminal station?

Ans.  High Impedance

17.  What kind of signaling is expected on analog channels? (DTMF, FSK, Select V)

Ans.  DTMF 

18 .  What is the standard of transmission and signaling in optical fiber and what kind of connection should be supported – active or passive?

Ans. Passive.  Caller ID/DTMF Detection.

19.  Should each unit support all kinds of transmission medium?

Ans. Yes

20.  Regarding the proposed intercept capability of fiber optic intercepts over an E1 trunk, are we to assume that the optical-to-electrical transformation is to be handled by the customer and our only requirement is to handle a standard electrical E1 trunk interface?

Ans.  Standard E1 trunk interface

21.  What is the number of user stations (e.g., workstations) that are required? 

Ans.  1 or 2

22.  Is there any preferred input line to user station ratio? 

Ans.  Analog / Voice Over Internet Protocol

23.  Can it be safely assumed that the power in the building that will house the equipment will be 110-volt, alternating current?

Ans.  Yes. 110v.

24.  Is there any preferred storage requirement?

Ans.  DVD

The items I am asking about are: Chin Bolt, Side Tackle Bolt, Cap Square Bolt, Train Tackle Bolt/Transporting Bolt, the Item Number 5B/Various Bolts, Breeching and Shackle Pin? What length should the threads be? From the nut pictured it appears to be a 1-8 thread.  No threads are requested at this time.  Should the training loop have threads on its 1/2 diameter ends?  Training loops do not have threads.   What thickness is the angle (Item Numbers 6B & 6C)? Does the original angle have a sharp outer corner (means it was a rolled profile) or a radiused outer corner (means it was hand formed)? Do the angles need any mounting holes in them?  Angle thickness is 1/8" with sharp outside corner.  No holes at this time.  Is there any forging dies or tooling available for the forging solicitation in order to expedite production or would new tooling have to be made?  There are no forging dies or tooling available to expedite production other than the Government-Furnished samples.  What would be required to pass inspection? Are there any specifications for surface, dimensions, quality of forgings or castings?  Inspection will be based on the surface texture of the Government-Furnished Samples provided and the specifications contained in the solicitation.    For item 1, we can bid based on a commonly used silicone bronze alloy we can quote based on a grade specified by you.  876 silicon bronze or equivalent performance is acceptable.  For item 2, although we have the drawings and photos as provided with the solicitation package, it would help us greatly to have the actual part weights in estimating material and process costs.
