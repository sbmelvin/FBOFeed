<p>Work under this project is comprised of designing and constructing a repair to the roof of Building 1025 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The existing pitched, metal roof has exceeded its useful life. The primary goal of this project is to furnish and install a new, Standing Seam Roof (SSR) system over the existing system, anchoring it to the existing steel structure below. Estimated Period of Performance (POP) for requirement is 169 days. IAW FAR 36.204(d) the estimated price range for this requirement is between $250,000 and $500,000.</p>
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluations described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.1 targeted toward a 100% Total Small Business set-a-side with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing).</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Kirtland AFB plans to include the following factors:</p>
<p>1) Cost/Price<br />2) Technical Acceptability<br />3) Past Performance</p>
<p>Within the Past Performance Factor the following sub-factor will be used:</p>
<p>a) Filled out Past Performance Information Forms</p>
<p>Within the Technical Acceptability Factor the following sub-factors will be used:</p>
<p>a) Technical Approach Narrative<br />b) Proposed Progress Schedule</p>
<p>The Cost/Price factor will be afforded primary emphasis in the evaluation. All other evaluation factors other than Cost/Price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost/price.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 25 February 2014 and close on or about 30 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation.

<DESC>The solicitation will be a sole source negotiated acquisition with General Electric Aviation (GE) (CAGE 07482) that calls the contractor to provide a holistic, performance based support solution for an improved level of availability for identified engine platforms. To meet the Government objectives specified in the solicitation, GE will perform the following logistics management functions by applying their Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) based engineering and technical expertise to improve: depot maintenance turnaround times, supply support, material management, reliability, engineering support and sustainment elements, obsolescence management, packaging, storage, transportation and field engineering support of engines manufactured by GE: the F101, F110-100, F110-129 and F118, hereafter referred to as "F Series Engines." The F Series Engines Bill of Materials (BOM) components pose significant engineering, technical, diminishing manufacturing sources and raw material acquisition challenges. DLA has determined that real-time access to the engineering expertise, technical data and understanding of the manufacturing processes offered by the OEM is essential to successfully provide support for F Series Engines' maintenance and improved availability. As such, the acquisition has been approved for Other than Full and Open Competition as prescribed by FAR 6.302-1. <br /><br />GE shall provide primary support to the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex (OC-ALC) F Series Engines production and component lines along with ancillary worldwide field support. GE's improved F Series Engines availability for the Air Force (AF) customer will enable the AF to meet or exceed its War Ready Engine (WRE) allocation requirements at a reduced overall cost to the Government. This level of support shall be provided for the entirety of the GE F Series Engines BOM. While GE is responsible for the comprehensive level of support, DLA will remain the source of supply for items specified for DLA sourcing at while GE shall utilize its commercial supply chain for identified GE sourced items.
<p>The acquisition is a Requirements, Fixed Price with Prospective Price Redetermination contract type. The term will be a five-year base period with a single, three-year option period. The total duration (base plus option period) shall not exceed eight years. As indicated above, the performance based requirement for holistic F Series Engine support has been approved as a sole source acquisition to GE. The solicitation will be available at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/ on its issue date, on or around 25 Feb 14 and will close on/about 3 Mar 14. Hard copies will not be available.</p>

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <BR> <BR>An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov .

The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp.

<SUBJECT>Bowerman Barn Beam Evaluation & Repair
<SOLNBR>AG-9AC7-S-14-0024
<RESPDATE>032714
<CONTACT>Katherine Pasini, Contracting Officer, Phone 530 252-6621, Fax 530 252-6408, Email kepasini@fs.fed.us - Michell D. Gutierrez, Procurement Tech, Phone 5302526673, Fax 5302526408, Email mdgutierrez@fs.fed.us
<DESC>SCOPE: The work of this Contract is to repair a timber frame connection of Bowerman Barn; to evaluate the rest of the connections to determine if other connections are solid or need repair; and to make recommendations on ways to mitigate other issues found during the evaluation.
<p>BACKGROUND: Bowerman Barn is timber frame building built in 1878 that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While painting in 2011 it was noticed that one of the timber frame connections slipped and is in need of repair. The frame connections are believed to be kept together by concealed wooden dowels. In the early 1990s the structure was evaluated (see attached plans) and cable "X" bracing was added to help support the building when lateral loads were applied. One of the connections where an internal beam is supported by a perpendicular beam at the external wall is supported by column. One of the "X" bracing cables was attached to one of the beams. At this location, the upper beam has shifted with respect to the supporting members roughly one foot (see attached connection photos). It is unknown if the shift of the beams was due to over tightening of the cables that might have caused the dowel to have been sheared through or if due to the age of the connection, the connection has failed for some other reason and that this connection may be an indicator of what may be happening or about to happen in other timber frame connections. A Restoration Plan and Structural Analysis was conducted by an Engineering Consultant in 1993, and is available to assist the Contractor (see attached Description of structural members and connections).</p>
<p>WORK: The work is broken in to three main parts.</p>
<p>Repair Existing Connection: Contractor is to re-align the timber frame connection that is out of alignment described above and provide a positive connect that will keep the beams from shifting with respect of one to another. The materials/devices used must be in keeping with the historical nature of the building; submitted to and approved by Contracting Officer; and approved or be able to be approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer.</p>
<p>Evaluate Entire Building: Contractor is to evaluate the entire structure to determine what repairs and or modifications would need to be made to allow for the structure to be used as a working barn and areas open to the public. Evaluation shall include but not be limited to checking other existing timber connections to ensure positive connections, the stability of the foundation, rodent hole issues, realigning the braced walls on the South side of barn, bug damage to wood members and dry rot.</p>
<p>Recommendations: Provide a summary report on the evaluation portion of the contract identifying each area reviewed and the concerns/issues that were identified. If no issues or concerns were identified in an area, still state the area evaluated and method how evaluation was made. Areas with issues or concerns should include but not be limited: level of employee/public safety at risk; level of risk to the historical building; options for correcting the concerns/issues and mitigating the risks; providing a recommendation in resolving the concerns/issues considering employee's/public's safety, historical nature of building and costs of repairs; and providing an estimate of cost to make the recommended repairs.</p>
<p>LOCATION OF PROJECT<br />The Bowerman Barn (40&#730; 54' 00.1" N, 122&#730; 46' 0.42" W; Elevation 2450 feet) is located on Guy Covington Drive off of Highway 3 approximately 23 miles North of Weaverville, CA.</p>
This solicitation will be available for electronic download on or around <br />February 25, 2014.<br />

<SUBJECT>A--DEVELOPMENT OF CLIMATE ANALYSIS FOR THE MALARIA INITIATIVE IMPACT EVALUATIONREPORTS
<SOLNBR>NNM14502691R
<ARCHDATE>02102015
<CONTACT>Iris  Walter, Contracts Administrator, Phone 256-961-7054, Fax 256-961-7148, Email Iris.R.Walter@nasa.gov - Jennifer B. McCaghren, Contracting Officer, Phone 256-544-5189, Fax 256-544-4400, Email jennifer.b.mccaghren@nasa.gov

<a href="mailto:Iris.R.Walter@nasa.gov">Iris  Walter</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for services involving development of climate analysis for the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) impact evaluation reports. This is a follow-on procurement to provide the Regional Visualization and Monitoring System (SERVIR) program with PMI impact evaluations to determine whether climate conditions are favorable for malaria transmission throughout the evaluation period nationally and/or sub-nationally, and to determine if there is an association between climatic variable change before and after the scale up of interventions.	This work will advance SERVIR climate services in East Africa. <p> NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Columbia University's International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI).  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: <p> 1. This procurement is an enhancement to activities already being conducted by IRI supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). NASA, implementing SERVIR in partnership with USAID, has been requested by USAID to leverage existing investments made by USAID.  Award to any other entity would result in duplication of costs to USAID and therefore the US Government overall and would not be recovered through competition and would fail to leverage the synergy of the ongoing efforts.  <p> 2. Funds available and dedicated to SERVIR from USAID under a Participating Agency Program Agreement included a stipulation that a portion of the funds be dedicated specifically to stakeholder engagement to understand and build demand for climate information products.  Furthermore, USAID specifically identified IRI as an institution with whom SERVIR should partner, given IRIs engagement in the regions and IRIs proven approaches for designing and delivering climate services to address critical regional needs in East Africa. <p> 3. IRI is the only contractor who can meet the current requirements of SERVIR in the near term time frame.  To expedite the process of designing new products, the services being sought are uniquely designed to build upon the relationships and experience that IRI possesses in East Africa.  IRI has a history of engagement with stakeholders in these to areas in East Africa, and IRI has specialized knowledge necessary to satisfy the requirements from the agreement with USAID.  Working with an organization other than IRI would involve a significant loss in previously gained experience and effort, and would consume considerably more time. <p> 4. SERVIR has had a contract with IRI in the past and completed a successful collaboration with IRI involving the integration of information products into SERVIRs geospatial platform and in performing similar PMI impact evaluations in other countries in East Africa. IRI is performing related work for SERVIR for different countries, under a SERVIR Applied Sciences Team effort (funded by NASA Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences solicitation). SERVIR can leverage IRIs experience to quickly implement expansion of these impact evaluations to additional countries, and satisfy additional technical requirements from USAID. <p> 5. SERVIR is a high-visibility project at NASA/MSFC, NASA/HQ, and USAID.  It is of benefit to NASA to deepen its affiliation with IRI, since IRI is a globally recognized institution with goals highly complementary to SERVIRs mission of enhancing developing country government stakeholders capability to understand, anticipate, and manage the impacts of climate change.  Therefore, it is beneficial for NASA to establish a formal relationship with IRI.	 <p> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Monday, February 24, 2014.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <p> Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. <p> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <p> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research, Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program, Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Branch plans to procure on a sole source basis a service contract with UC Davis School of Medicine, 2103 Stockton Blvd., Suite 2226, Sacramento, CA 95817.<br /><br />This process will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisitions procedures as stated in FAR Part 13 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt for the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 - All other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services and the business size standard is 14 million. Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.<br /><br />The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) aims to reduce the risk, incidence, and deaths from cancer as well as enhance the quality of life for cancer survivors. The Division conducts and supports an integrated program of the highest quality genetic, epidemiologic, behavioral, social, and surveillance cancer research.
<p>Breast cancer mortality rates have declined over the past 20 years and although much of the improvements in mortality have been attributed to early diagnosis and adjuvant treatment of early stage breast cancer, these treatment regimens are associated with substantial short-term toxicity and risk of long-term adverse effects, such as secondary malignancies, neuropathy, cognitive impairment, and cardiotoxicity. Until recently, women with breast cancer have received adjuvant chemotherapy based on clinical recurrence risk classification using qualitative tumor characteristics, such as size, type and grade, receptor status, and histology, although increasingly gene expression profiling is being used to direct adjuvant therapy choices. Nevertheless, many women will still receive adjuvant chemotherapy that will have only a modest effect on disease-free and overall survival. These patients may receive limited benefit from chemotherapy and an improved understanding of these long-term adverse risks of treatment could help to inform clinical decision-making about adjuvant chemotherapy (i.e., women with low risk of recurrence could avoid potential toxicity and morbidity of adjuvant chemotherapy). Even when use of chemotherapy is indicated, patients are seldom informed about the specific risks for long-term and late effects, which could potentially inform treatment decision-making. Yet, no systematic reviews or risk appraisal have addressed this question.</p>
<p>Long-term and late adverse effects (e.g., leukemia, congestive heart failure, neuropathy, cognitive dysfunction, infertility) of chemotherapy are widely acknowledged, but their risks are not explicitly considered in currently available risk prediction models. This limits the ability of clinicians and patients to weigh the potential harms versus benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in treatment decision making. Randomized trials of adjuvant chemotherapy have predominantly focused on evaluating the reduction in cancer recurrence and on treatment-associated short-term adverse effects. Less attention has been given to long-term adverse effects of these cytotoxic drugs, which may have significant negative impacts on health and QOL for breast cancer survivors long after their treatment ends.</p>
<p>The aim of this requirement is to estimate the rates of long-term adverse effects of commonly used adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer by conducting a systematic review of the literature and by analyzing data collected from a clinical trial of over 5,000 patients with node-positive breast cancer. This project is critical not only to define what the NCI currently knows about treatment harms, but perhaps more importantly, to identify gaps in existing knowledge that will guide future research. This project will help inform the NCI in the planning and prioritizing future research initiatives developing patient-level risk prediction model to assist patients and clinicians in making informed decisions about the benefits and risks of adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:<br />The Contractor shall provide adequate equipment, supplies, facilities, and scientific materials necessary for carrying out the requirements of this project. The Contractor shall work on several key tasks, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1. Evaluate the literature on long-term adverse events following treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients draft a manuscript reporting the findings. <br />a. Specifically, information from published literature on chemotherapy agents commonly used in the U.S. for breast cancer adjuvant therapy (i.e., anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, taxanes, and trastuzumab) and the risk of chemotherapy-related adverse events (i.e., cardiac toxicity, ovarian failure, secondary malignancies, neurotoxicity, and cognitive dysfunction) will be systematically reviewed and described. The completed manuscript shall be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. <br />2. Conduct secondary analyses using data from the NSABP B-30 trial to estimate the frequency and impact of adverse events resulting from adjuvant chemotherapy and draft a manuscript reporting the findings. <br />a. Data from the NSABP B-30 trial, which enrolled over 5,000 node-positive breast cancer patients who were randomized to three different treatment arms containing an anthracycline and a taxane, shall be analyzed by the Contractor and shall supplement finding from the systematic review.<br />Payment shall be made after acceptance by the Government of each deliverable.</p>
<p>Period of performance: 12 months from the date of award.</p>
<p>This project requires expertise in epidemiology, evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, breast oncology treatment, survivorship and quality of life. The UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research currently employs a research team of scientists who are uniquely qualified to perform this work and bring a unique combination of experience with systematic reviews and rigorous training in epidemiology, evidence-based medicine, benefit-risk prediction modeling for patient decision-making and breast cancer treatment and survivorship. This research team brings key access to data from the NSABP B-30 trial, and with expertise in the Bayesian statistical models, has the ability to address the key research questions that NCI requires with highest level of content knowledge, familiarity with and access to the NSABP B-30 data, methodological rigor and advanced statistical techniques that could not replicated elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on, February 25, 2013. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Gwennifer Epps, Contracting Officer at ge50d@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), through sam.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number N02CP46019-83 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The NIAID intends to solicit a sole source contract with the University of Washington to perform a Chlamydia trachomatis vaccine safety and efficacy study.  This contract is a follow-on to the Topical Microbicide Safety and Efficacy Evaluation in Nonhuman Primates contract (HHSN266200700013C).
<p>The purpose of this follow-on contract is to continue development of a Chlamydia STD vaccine by performing an efficacy study in pigtail macaques.  This efficacy study follows the pathogenesis study currently being conducted under the contract with University of Washington.  The NIAID seeks to test this vaccine for efficacy using the female pigtail macaque against sexually transmitted Chlamydia D/LC/P+ with an intact CT135 gene and plasmid to determine if a phase 1 clinical trial is appropriate.  The University of Washington possesses the facilities, resources, expertise and access to pigtail macaques that make it uniquely qualified to perform this work.  Additionally, the safety and efficacy study must be performed on specimens from the same source as those used for the pathogenesis study.  Since the pathogenesis study is already underway at University of Washington, awarding the contract to another source would result in substantial duplication of costs.</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The unique services University of Washington can provide make it the only responsible source capable of supplying the services required by the NIAID.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. &nbsp;NIAID anticipates awarding a cost-type completion contract as a result of this announcement with a performance period of 9 months.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. A Research and Development Sources Sought Notice was posted on November 4, 2013 as HHSN-NIH-NIAID-RDSS-14-NIHAI2014003.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. &nbsp;The RFP will be available on or about February 25, 2014. &nbsp;Interested parties may contact the points of contact referenced in this announcement.</p>

<DESC>The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) Act (Public Law 108-184), signed by President Bush on December 16, 2003, established NMAAHC as the Smithsonian Institution's newest museum. NMAAHC is the national museum for the study and exposition of African American history and culture; it is scheduled to open in late 2015.
<p>NMAAHC will be constructed on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. at its intersection with the Washington Monument Grounds. The National Mall, Washington Monument, and the Washington Monument Grounds are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The five-acre site is bounded by Constitution Avenue and Madison Drive, between 14th and 15th Streets, NW. The site will be developed with landscaping and improvements for outdoor museum programs, consistent with its context as contributing to a National Historic Landmark on the National Mall and the Washington Monument Grounds.</p>
<p>The museum will be approximately 390,000 gross square feet in size, including approximately 84,000 square feet of public exhibition space, plus a 5,000 square foot changing gallery. In addition to exhibition galleries, there will be performance and public program spaces, a 350-seat theater, food service, and retail spaces. Non-public spaces will include an integrated loading dock, collection workrooms, exhibit production shops, administrative offices, and support spaces. The building will incorporate state-of-the-art technologies for exhibits, research, and communications. NMAAHC design, construction, and operations are planned to achieve LEED Gold certification with exhibit fabrication a contributor to obtaining LEED points.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institution seeks to pre-qualify prime contractors to furnish exhibition fabrication and installation services for NMAAHC. Work under this project will include fabrication, delivery, and installation of all casework, graphics, scenic finishes, and exhibition lighting. Artifact mounts, AV equipment and integration, and media production are not included in the work, but the selected contractor will be required to coordinate with these trades to complete the project.</p>
<p>Please note that this solicitation will be conducted in two phases: (1) a Request for Qualifications (RFQ); and (2) a Request for Proposals (RFP). The first phase involves the submission of a firm's qualifications to handle this project. A short-list of offerors will be selected based on these qualifications' submissions. The second phase, which will be conducted with the short-listed offerors, will include a meeting with Smithsonian representatives and submission of proposals.<br /><br />At a minimum, firm evaluation in the RFQ phase will be based on the following criteria:</p>

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG), Office of Contract Operations (CG-912), Formal Contracts Division II (CG-9122) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Oracle National Security Group, 12701 Fair Lakes CR, Suite 800, Fairfax, VA under the authority of FAR 6.303-2. The USCG has a need to obtain a continuation of Oracle Professional Services for the ISR Data Analysis &amp; Manipulation Division (CG-262). Oracle technical professionals are required to assist the MAGNET technical team with the migration of the existing MAGNET system and data onto the new infrastructure which includes upgrade from the existing Oracle 10g database environment to an Oracle 11g database environment, develop security protocols and lock-downs based on Oracle best practices and IC/DHS/USCG standards, and provide services to plan and implement Client Assurance (CA) of which Oracle is the only provider. Oracle Professional Services are also needed to troubleshoot and quickly resolve any issues that may arise during this complex upgrade. These services could potentially be provided by other companies, but they would need to develop the necessary hardware and software technical expertise that already exists with the Oracle NSG as the SSC is engineered and managed by them. For these reasons, USCG believes that Oracle NSG should provide the proposed requirements.
<p>Requirements include: Upgrade of MAGNET R2 to R4; Plan for Implementation of Client Assurance (CA) in the MAGNET R4 Architecture; Implementation of Client Assurance (CA) in the MAGNET R4 Architecture; Other Oracle Services (Monthly Activity Reports, Technical services as needed to ensure the MAGNET R4 upgrade is stable and running at optimal performance).</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A) provides sole source authority when a contracting officer deems only one source is available in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for quotes; however, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to this posting by 12:00 PM, ET, February 25, 2014 by e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Wendy Paulo at Wendy.L.Paulo@uscg.mil.</p>

The Contractor shall make repairs of all damage (corrective maintenance) to the HDW caused by overheating of the server room. The VAPAHCS Server Room overheated, significantly damaging the HAIISS Data Warehouse. A catastrophic failure of the Oracle database clusters, Informatica PowerCenter and Medical Domain Object servers were damaged: (1) HAIISS's Oracle database cluster. This damage was to the extent that a complete re-installation and configuration of the environment was required. (2) Informatica PowerCenter server became inoperable and that a complete re-installation and configuration of the environment was required (3) The Medical Domain Objects extractor and Orchestrator servers had to be re-installed and re-configured.

The Contractor shall furnish project management, corrective maintenance of the HAIISS Data Warehouse. Corrective maintenance refers to changes necessitated by actual errors (induced or residual "bugs") in a software system. OPHSR, as the business owner, will determine the type of maintenance and priority assigned to each support item. The Contractor shall utilize the VA's established online tools for project management and tracking; currently, IBM Rational Tools.

The Contractor shall track and document resolution of corrective maintenance support requests for HDW downstream users such as QC Pathfinder and the engineering team from Vecna Technologies maintaining QC Pathfinder, Biosurveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics, and OPHSR.

The expected period of performance is 1 September 2014 through 31 August 2015. The purpose of this synopsis is to gather interest, capabilities, and past performance (i.e., relevant and recent) of small business capable of supporting M3 requirements for the AMRG, an FOA of the ASA(M&RA), Alexandria, VA 22332. <br>  <br> Each contract period may include the following functional tasks:  current and forecasted core markets profile; current and forecasted US Army market penetration with core markets and influencers; current and forecasted gaps in media coverage; resource allocation review and analysis to maximize coverage; and sensitivity analysis of resource allocations to budget reductions (i.e., 10%, 20%, 30%, etc.). <br>  <br> BACKGROUND:  AMRG generates interest in Army service options through targeted marketing campaigns in order to motivate well-qualified candidates to join the Army.

It employs enterprise marketing strategies and processes via the Enterprise Army Brand (EAB) in support of the Active Army and US Army Reserve (USAR) recruiting activities for officers, enlisted, and Department of the Army Civilians (DACs).  <br> Other AMRG responsibilities include:  informs the ASA(M&RA) on strategic issues and directions; provides policy, programming and supervision of the Army's marketing and advertising strategy and programs; establishes, maintains and monitors performance evaluation of the ASA(M&RA); management and performance evaluation of the Army's advertising contract; ensures policies, and programs within the Human Capital (HC) arena are consistent with statutes and the Secretary of the Army's objectives; and operational control of the US Army Accessions Support Brigade (USAASB) and its subordinate units. <br>   <br> The EAB connects America with the Army and promotes the positive value of Army service. It represents the reputation and ideals of the United States Army, and educates and promotes the positive value of Army service options to service-age citizens and their influencers. The EAB unifies key message elements of each of the Army service options: Enlisted, Officer, Special Missions, and Civilian sub-brands.   Key messaging goals of the Army Brand are to:  showcase the Army as a unique American institution that is representative of the country it serves during periods of peace and war; highlight the multiple paths of service available within the United States Army and distinguish from other services; promote the training, educational, financial, and career benefits offered by the Army in order to attract the most qualified candidates to Army service opportunities; educate influencers about the positive impacts and opportunities offered to America's youth by today's modern, technological Army; provide a focal point for marketing, advertising, and trade marking activities to reinforce positive associations with prestige, protection of the nation, technology and opportunity; influence qualified professionals to explore service opportunities offered by the Judge Advocate General's Corps, Army Medical Department, and Chaplain Corps by highlighting opportunities for valuable training and rewarding careers; and promote Reserve and DAC opportunities in order to retain highly qualified personnel who are transitioning from Active Duty service. <br>  <br> OBJECTIVES: The Army Brand and Marketing Program supports the Army Brand by delivering consistent messaging through national level advertising, marketing events, partnerships with external organizations, trademarking, and other internal and external communications. The objectives of the Army Brand and Marketing program are to:  increase the propensity for Army service; improve the Army's image so that it is the top service choice; strengthen partnerships between the Army and American educators; attract top prospects in support of accessions and hiring goals; and develop institutional processes that support targeted marketing campaigns.  <br>  <br> CONTRACTOR MANPOWER REPORTING:  Required. <br> CITIZENSHIP:  US Citizenship required. <br> GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT/PROPERTY (GFE/GFP) PROVIDED:  YES <br> CONTRACTOR-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT/PROPERTY (CFE/CFP) TO BE PROVIDED:  YES <br> DOL'S THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT:  APPLICABLE. <br>  <br> Supporting documentation must not exceed a total of 10 pages and be in the following formats: MS WORD, MS EXCEL, and/or .pdf documents.

<SUBJECT>Y--Oahe Switchyard Upgrade Phase I.  Improvements to be made include upgrading all line bays to a double-bus double-breaker scheme in both the 115kV and 230kV switchyards
<SOLNBR>W9128F14SC011
<RESPDATE>022514

<CONTACT>Rachelle Hairston, 402-995-2045

<a href="mailto:rachelle.e.hairston@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Omaha</a>
<DESC>Description of Work <br> Oahe Switchyard Upgrade Phase I <br>  <br>  <br> The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District is seeking information regarding capability and availability of potential small business contractors to perform work <br>  <br> Project Background - The Oahe powerhouse is located on the Missouri River just north of Pierre, South Dakota. Construction started in 1948 and was completed in 1962. The project has seven Francis type turbine generators with a total capacity of 786MW. This power is delivered to the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) at 115kV and at 230kV. The 115kV switchyard is joined to the 230kV switchyard through one autotransformer. Each switchyard is configured in a main and transfer breaker scheme using a Main Bus and an Auxiliary Bus. The Main Bus on both switchyards has a breaker for each transmission line, while the Aux Bus on both witchyards has a single transfer breaker with common relaying on transfer breaker 2486 and MOD's on each bay for use in bypassing a single line breaker. <br>  <br> Project Existing Conditions - The current switchyard configuration does not offer the redundancy necessary to meet modern system demands. Loss of the Oahe 115kV bus results in a loss of the Oahe autotransformer and Oahe Generating Unit No.1, including the voltage support to the 115kV Pierre Load pocket. The Pierre Load pocket is then left served by a single power line out of the Irv Simmons switchyard. An undervoltage load shedding scheme must then be implemented to keep this connection from being tripped off line. <br>  <br> All of the existing oil-filled circuit breakers have been replaced with new 2000A SF6 circuit <br> breakers in 2010-2011. The Main Bus and Auxiliary Bus are both rated 2000A. All line bays are <br> rated 1200A although their breakers are now 2000A. <br>  <br> There is much corrosion on the post insulator supports, and the post insulators are the old cap-and-pin type no longer manufactured. The cap-and-pin design ultimately experiences failure <br> where the insulator sections separate due to expansion of the cement in the joints between the <br> porcelain surfaces. The Project requested that all post insulators be replaced with new modern <br> insulators, and that replacement posts be fabricated and furnished for future replacement. The <br> number of posts to be furnished was to be derived by the Project, but at this time, no data is <br> available; therefore, the design assumes that 30 posts of each voltage class with an option to provide more on a cost-per-post basis. <br>  <br> The existing disconnect switch operating platforms are supported off the ground by insulators, <br> which is a very uncommon design and could defeat the purpose of grounding. The Project also <br> reports that these platforms are too small to serve their purpose in a practical manner - in fact it <br> is not possible to remain standing on a platform while moving the manual switch operator through  its full range of motion. <br>  <br> Scope of Work of Upgrade - Improvements to be made include upgrading all line bays to a double-bus double-breaker scheme in both the 115kV and 230kV switchyards by replacing the line bay MOD's with breakers; installing a second autotransformer with double-bus double-breaker sources; replacing the existing autotransformer with a larger unit; and replacing the bus tie breakers in the 230kV Main Bus with MOD's. Improvements for this contract include installing the second autotransformer and breakers for a double-bus double-breaker scheme, and upgrading the Pierre and Irv Simmons lines to double-bus double-breaker configurations as requested by WAPA to alleviate current power flow problems as soon as possible. The remaining line bays, replacement of the existing autotransformer and replacement of the sectionalizing breakers with MOD's will be performed under subsequent contracts and are not part of this work effort.  <br>  <br> The new 150MVA autotransformer will be provided as Government Furnished equipment. <br>  <br>  <br> All interested, responsive and responsible contractors are encouraged to participate in this market research by submitting a response via e-mail to david.w.neal@usace.army.mil no later than 2:00 PM CST 25 February 2014. Responses should include the company name, address, contact name and title, phone number, e-mail address, business size and classification/certification under NAICS Code 237990, CAGE Code, DUNS Number, your bonding capacity (single and aggregate) and a list of your company's three (3) most recent projects of the same type described in this notice.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation. This Sources Sought Announcement is for the purpose of identifying small business concerns who are capable and interested in bidding on this dredging project.
<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking sources for a construction project titled, Lower Snake and Clearwater Rivers Navigation Maintenance Dredging. This will be a fixed price construction contract. Place of performance is Franklin, Whitman, Asotin, and Garfield Counties in Washington State and Nez Perce County in Idaho. Construction magnitude is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Performance and payment bonds in the amount of 100% of the contract price will be required. Responses to this announcement are due no later than 25 February 2014 at 5:00pm, Pacific.</p>
<p>The work consists of mechanical dredging of the federal navigation channel, port berthing areas, and a navigation lock approach at four locations on the Snake River and lower Clearwater River. One site is the downstream navigation lock approach for Ice Harbor Dam Snake River Mile (RM) 9.5, while the other three sites are located at the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater rivers in Lower Granite reservoir. The three sites in Lower Granite are the Federal channel (Snake RM 138 to Clearwater RM 2) and the berthing areas for the Port of Lewiston (Clearwater RM 1-1.5) and Port of Clarkston (Snake RM 137.9 and 139). The dredging quantities are approximately 2,337 cubic yards at Ice Harbor Dam (Snake RM 9.5), 458,472 cubic yards at Federal channel (Snake RM 138 to Clearwater RM 2), 14,143 cubic yards at Port of Clarkston (Snake RM 137.9 and 139), and 4,664 cubic yards at Port of Lewiston (Clearwater RM 1-1.5). The Corps identified a location in the Lower Granite reservoir (Snake RM 116) just upstream of Knoxway Canyon, as the in-water disposal site of the dredged materials. Disposal will include selective placement of material to construct a near-shore underwater bench and shape to create fish habitat. Disposal would form a uniform, gently sloping shallow-water bench along about 2,500 linear feet of shoreline. The top width of the dredging disposal section would be approximately 200 linear feet and generally would have a 2%-5% slope from the shoreline sloping out to the side slope catch point. The side slope of the dredging disposal section generally would be 1V on 10H (1 foot vertical on 10 feet linear). The water depth along the shoreline after placement of the dredged material would be 6-8 feet. The current water depths at the disposal site, RM 116, range from 20-30 feet. The work will also include before (pre), progress and after (post) hydrographic surveys, for the dredge and disposal areas for topographic control and quantity calculations, and water quality monitoring. Total volume of dredged material for all four locations is approximately 400,000 to 500,000 cubic yards.</p>
<p>The onsite performance period is Dec 15, 2014 - Feb 14, 2015.</p>
<p>In the sources sought response, interested contractors MUST submit the following: 1) Describe your approach to successfully complete the dredging quantities within the onsite performance period considering the distance between the dredging locations described above and the disposal location RM116. 2) In the last dredging action in 2005-2006 turbidity limits were exceeded during the re-handling along the shoreline, momentarily stopping the placement several times and delaying completion of the dredged material placement. For the present acquisition, re-handling of the dredged material is required to place the material along the shoreline at RM 116 to achieve the desired contours. Generally describe your re-handling process at RM 116 and preventive actions to limit turbidity exceedances. 3) Describe the topographic and hydrographic surveying methods and procedures, positioning and depth finding means, you intend to use to monitor dredge performance, progress, and pay requests, and to provide quality control of completed dredged sections. 4) Describe your past experience using "real time" water quality monitoring, data acquisition systems that use satellite/cell phone telemetry, database development, and web-based data displays. 5) Submit your past performance history of work similar to the work described in the sources sought above. <br /><br />The Contractor will be required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at http://publications.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/EM_385-1-1_languages/EM_385-1-1_English_2008/toc.html</p>
<p>This sources-sought announcement is issued for the purpose of identifying small business concerns, including HUBZone small business firms, woman-owned small business firms, small disadvantaged business firms, veteran-owned small business firms, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms, with the capability to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>Information from firms who respond to this announcement by submitting a statement addressing the five technical areas identified above will be used in the Government's determination of whether to set aside this requirement for small business or open it to unrestricted competition. Include your firm's DUNS number, bonding capacity, and a statement indicating your small business type (small business, HUBZone, woman-owned, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned, or service-disabled veteran-owned.) The NAICS Code for this project is 237990. The small business size standard for Dredging is no more than $25,500,000 in average annual receipts AND the firm must perform at least 40 percent of the volume dredged with its own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern. Please email your response to: Phyllis.L.Buerstatte@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>All responses to this notice must be received on or before 5:00pm, Pacific time, on 25 February 2014.</p>

Background:
The VHA Office of Analytics and Business Intelligence (OABI) is the headquarters for the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients (SHEP) program.  Since 1995 variants of the SHEP program have focused on two broad based patient populations; recently discharged inpatients, and patients receiving recent VA ambulatory care. The SHEP program has also surveyed special populations like Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation New Dawn (OND) patients, Home Based Primary Care (HBPC), and others.  The SHEP program has consistently measured and reported results at various levels of the organization and to other internal and external stakeholders.  

In an effort to support government transparency and support the goal of benchmarking VHA performance against private sector healthcare, the SHEP program transitioned to using the CAHPS family of surveys in 2009. OABI is looking for a contractor with a provisional or full CAHPS certification to provide mail-out administration of veteran patient experience surveys and related services to veterans receiving specified types of care at or through all 153 Medical Centers and approximately 1,000 Outpatient Clinics of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  The principal patient populations to be surveyed are recently discharged inpatients and patients receiving healthcare as outpatients, but surveys for other populations may be developed and fielded, as necessary.  

Please see the Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for all proposed technical requirements.

Performance Work Statement Questions
1.	Are any of the requirements included in the draft PWS unreasonable and/or unattainable? If so, why?
2.	What alternative requirements should VA consider using that would meet the intent of the goals/objectives of requirements that appear to be unreasonable and/or unattainable?
3.	Please provide any comments and/or questions you may have, as well as your thoughts on the draft PWS.
4.	To accomplish the requirements of the PWS, what schedule and timeline would your firm propose?
5.	What else has your firm seen that could help better structure the VA offering?

Acquisition Questions:
6.	Provide an example of a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) Structure that you feel would be the most efficient and effective for this award.
7.	Identify potential issues or concerns (from your previous experience) that should be addressed by the VA to avoid circumstances where anticipated savings are smaller than expected or realized.
8.	How long do you feel it will take your firm to prepare a formal response (technical and price proposal) to a solicitation for this project?
9.	What existing contract vehicles does your firm utilize for similar projects? e.g., GSA Schedule 70, GWACS such as GSA Alliant, another GSA contract or BPA, open market (FAR 12&15).  Are any of them applicable to this requirement?
10.	Do you believe this is a commercial or non-commercial requirement? 
11.	Regarding payment methodologies and contract types, is your offering suitable for a hybrid Firm Fixed Price/Labor Hours solution (using labor hours for integration/implementation), Time and Materials, or can your firm provide a total Firm Fixed Price solution for the requirement?  Is there another suggested contract type that you recommend?
12.	Does your firm have experience (past performance data) related to a similar size and scope Federal Government Requirement?
13.	Provide your company's pricing model?
14.	What is the suggested North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort?
15.	Does your firm have any additional questions, comments, or concerns about the framing of this requirement? 

We are seeking industry experts to help make this Government requirement better for the end user and ultimately reduce the cost to the tax payer.  All comments are welcome.

Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,

Jane Oney

<DESC>Introduction
This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for market research and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  

The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.

Background

The mission of the VA Enterprise Operations (EO) is to provide high quality, cost-effective information technology (IT) business solutions to VA and other Federal agency customers.  EO has been a major data center in VA's system for over 40 years and is committed to supporting the Department's IT requirements.  EO provides Data Protection services to its customers' data through disk mirroring and tape backups.  Routine evaluation of the tape and storage environment is required to ensure Data Protection and Disaster Recovery resources are available to the customer in a timely manner.  To meet its customers' ever increasing data storage requirements it has to maintain a large amount of storage.  Maintaining large volumes of un-used storage for any given period of time is not cost effective, increasing the storage costs to our Corporate Data Center Operations (CDCO)  customers, and is becoming extremely challenging with such technologies as cloud computing.

Requirements

VA requires a storage approach that is tailored to the storage demands of the EO customer and not only takes into account growth, but also the rate of growth and the predictability or unpredictability of that growth.  Such an approach needs to be scalable to address the various performance needs of the EO customer as well as capacity. 

A 'storage on demand' strategy, sometimes referred to as "Utility Computing", would enable the datacenters to position large amounts of storage platforms (fully populated) on the computer room floor and only be charged when utilized (on demand).  This approach aligns operational needs with procurement; reduces capital expenditures; provides ready-for-use capacity in as little as 72 hours; and possibly could negate maintenance costs. The VA EO is the owner, as there will be extra capacity on the floor to meet on demand requests.  This capacity management is required for each of the sites listed in place of performance.

A storage on demand strategy coupled with Management Services will provide EO with a holistic storage service offering in a timely manner. 

Submittal Information

This is a RFI only.  It is requested that all companies interested in participating in this effort note their interest and provide indication of their respective capabilities to perform the effort described in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS), entitled "Storage on Demand".

<DESC>Army Contracting Command- Warren issued a Market Survey for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) - Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP)/Full Rate Production (FRP) Phase. It is an inquiry intended to measure the level of industry interest and industry ability in competing for a potential USG contract. Responses to this survey may influence the USG's decision to issue the subject solicitation under full and open competition. This is not a pre-solicitation notice or Request for Proposals (RFP). Nor will a contract be awarded from this announcement. Information provided regarding the potential contract as presented in this Market Survey is subject to change. Additionally, as a Market Survey, this inquiry does not bind the USG to solicit for or award a competitive contract. Participation in the survey is also wholly voluntary on the part of the contractor as no reimbursements will be made to any contractor for costs associated with their participation in the survey. Data submitted to the USG will not be returned but will remain archived as part of the survey's historic records. Lastly, participation in this Market Survey, while important to the Army and United States Marine Corp (USMC) acquisition planners, is neither mandatory nor is it requisite to future participation by the contractor in this or a similar contract RFPs. The link below will take you directly to PROCNET, where you will find the Market Survey. http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/majorsys/jltvfrp/jltvfrp.htm

<a href="mailto:anna.r.delozier.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Fort Huachuca</a>
<DESC>Request for Interest and Qualification <br> Building 66050, Fort Huachuca, Arizona <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Garrison, Fort Huachuca, Arizona, is looking for qualified individuals or organizations with an interest in acquiring a World War II service club through a no-cost lease or sale, to include rehabilitation or removal. Building 66050, Mountain View Officers' Club (MVOC), served as a black officers' club from 1942-1945, and in various other capacities after that until deactivation in the late 1990s. The Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) determined the building to be historic because of its association with the period in history leading to racial desegregation within the U.S. Army. It is eligible for listing to the NRHP and a local Tucson historic preservation group is pursuing formal nomination. Because of the historic status, all rehabilitation work must comply with the Secretary of Interior Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and would be eligible for tax credits upon nomination. Formal listing may affect sale or lease terms and intended uses depending on the governmental or status of interested parties. <br>  <br> Building 66050 was constructed in 1942 as a standard Service Club Type SC-3 of the 700 series, a recreational facility with single large ball room in the center surrounded by smaller offices, bathrooms, storage rooms, and a kitchen. The building is a two-story, wood-frame building set on concrete pier foundations. The main building measures 90 by 112 by 23 ft. high, with a 40 by 75 by 15 ft. high wing on the east side and a 20 by 60 ft. addition on the northwest corner. The Fort Huachuca Building Inventory Schedule lists 17,378 square feet of interior space. The facility includes an outside patio and grill, paved access roads and parking lot, tennis court, baseball field, and playground. The area around these facilities is vacant, and the amount of acreage included in a lease is negotiable. MVOC has been vacant since ca. 1998 and is in disrepair. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL) completed a historical and structural analysis of Building 66050 in 2011. They determined that the building is structurally sound but requires extensive renovation to make it useable and habitable. Based on CERL's estimate for restoration, Fort Huachuca determined the cost for rehabilitation to range from $5 - $6 million. This includes rehabilitation of the building, repair and upgrade of the exterior infrastructure (road and parking lot repair, utility replacement, etc.), and project design and inspection.  These costs include demolition of the tennis court, which is in poor condition.  These costs do not include annual utility, infrastructure, and maintenance expenses. The cost estimate for rehabilitation will differ from a no-cost sale and removal of the building. <br>  <br> Fort Huachuca has determined that the Army has no current or future use for Building 66050, and thus cannot use sustainment funding to rehabilitate or mothball the facility. They have proposed to demolish the building unless another viable option is identified. The Army is currently in Section 106 consultation concerning the future disposition of the facility. As part of this process, Fort Huachuca is seeking qualified individuals or organizations with an interest and documented financial resources and backing to lease or move the building. Interested parties must submit an initial response to Fort Huachuca no later than March 7th, 2014.  This response must include the following information: <br> 1. Name of organization; <br> 2. Proposed uses of the building and surrounding acreage; <br> 3. Qualifications, capabilities, and resources to implement the proposed use, including examples of any projects completed similar to the proposed use; <br> 4. Documented financial ability to enter into a no-cost lease agreement or no-cost sale to rehabilitate or move the facility; <br> 5. Estimates of proposals pertaining to costs and improvements and proposed sources of maintenance funds necessary to implement the proposed use; and <br> 6. Any additional information necessary for the response to the RFI to be fully analyzed and understood. <br>  <br> The organization will need to provide additional details on their plan to execute the rehabilitation or move the building no later than April 7th, 2014, which is 30 days after the initial submittal. Respondents are reminded to properly mark any information they consider proprietary or that they do not want publicly disclosed. Additional information concerning the facility and a site tour is available upon request. All inquiries should be directed to the Fort Huachuca cultural resources manager, Mr. Martyn Tagg, at martyn.d.tagg.civ@mail.mil or 520-533-4428. <br>  <br> DISCLAIMER:  THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION is for Government planning purposes only and is being used as an instrument to identify potential sources that can provide the capabilities described within this notice. The information provided in this notice is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP) or any other commitment by the U.S. Government to enter into any type of agreement based on responses to this notice. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification. The Government will use the information received to help determine alternative courses of action with regard to this property. Additionally, all submissions become government property and will not be returned. No basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this RFI.

<DESC> <br> This notice is a request for information (RFI) and is not a request for proposals (RFP). The government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it.  Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. <br>  <br> Description <br>  <br> The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center-Fort Eustis (MICC-Eustis) is seeking information on approaches and methods that can be used to remotely manage Digital Training Facilities (DTF) for the Product Director Distributed Learning System (PD DLS) located at 11846 Rock Landing Dr, Newport News, VA.  The DLS is described at https://www.dls.army.mil.  The Army is seeking market research, potential sources, and best practice information to remotely manage 215 DTFs located at 88 geographically separated locations throughout the world.  The DTF is a digital class room supporting up to 12 students at Reserve Component locations or up to 16 students at Army Active installations.  The DTFs supports collective (group) training by providing classroom style environments.  DTFs provide networked computers that support digital training, Video Tele-training equipment supporting courseware transmission from remote sites, and servers to interface Army intranets and the internet. DTFs also provide individual Soldiers with an on-base location to access web-based, job related and professional courses.  The DLS network is centrally managed through an Enterprise Management Center (EMC) located on Fort Eustis, VA.  A Government Distributed Learning Point of Contract (DLPOC) is appointed at each location.  All DTF equipment and furnishings are currently provided by the Government.  Security cameras with remote monitoring capability are installed in each DTF. <br>  <br> Current Operations: <br>  <br> The DLS currently provides an on-site DTF Manager (DTFM) at each location to support the DTFs.  The DTFM manages the DTF by scheduling user training, controlling access to the facility, inventorying the DTF equipment, and ensuring the facility is maintained in a neat and orderly configuration.  The DTFM performs daily operational checks and reports equipment troubles to the EMC (and the local DL POC), assists (and under instructions from the EMC) validates/corrects system and equipment troubles, coordinates on-site support for periodic equipment/facility upgrades, and provides support materials (e.g. printer supplies).  The DTFM validates the credentials (common access card (CAC) and other personal identification) of new users of the DTF, submits a request for a user ID to the EMC, and enters the DTF domain on the user's CAC.  The DTFM also assists new users of DTF equipment to access the DLS network as well as helps the user to locate and navigate on-line training courseware.  The DTFM promotes the capabilities of the DLS and DTF to encourage usage of the facilities by local Army units and personnel.  The DTFM also collects and reports data on facility usage. <br>  <br> Submission Instructions: <br>  <br> 1.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) IARPA-RFI-14-03
<p>Security and Privacy Assurance Research-Multiparty<br />Computation (SPAR-MPC)</p>
<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is seeking information relevant to developing tools for automatically generating provably secure multiparty computation protocols given specifics of the intended applications.   This request for information (RFI) is issued solely for information gathering and planning purposes; this RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals.  The following sections of this RFI define the overall scope of the technical domain of interest, several technical areas in which specific information is sought, and instructions for the preparation and submission of responses.</p>
<p>Problem Background and Scope</p>
<p>Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) is a solution to the very general problem in which parties A, B, ... want to compute a joint function f (a, b, ...) on their respective inputs, but no party wants to reveal its input to any other party.  The function to be computed can be as simple as the value of a statistic on the data or as complex as the result of an interactive program.   For example, MPC protocols can</p>
<p>&bull;	Allow  a  person  or  corporation  to  store  and  manipulate  data  in  an  untrusted  cloud computing  infrastructure  as  confidentially  as  if  that  data  were  stored  in  their  own network,<br />&bull;	Allow a Web server to customize the presentation of data based on a user's identity, preferences, interests, or other private information, without learning that information, or<br />&bull;	Allow a group of users to determine a course of action that is optimal for the group as a whole, without requiring any user to reveal which course of action they personally prefer.</p>
<p>MPC protocols have been studied for a few decades now, with research continually improving the communication and computational efficiency for specific functions or security definitions [Y86, GMW86, GMW87].</p>
<p>The design of an MPC protocol for a specific application typically considers three main factors: a model of the available computation, an appropriate security threat model, and the specific computation to be performed.  First, a computational model includes the number of participants, the computing architecture available to each participant (e.g., Central Processing Unit (CPU) speed, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip size, amount of parallelism, and available storage), and the networking architecture (e.g., topology, latency, bandwidth, and the ability to broadcast  or  synchronize  transmissions).     Second,  a  security  threat  model  includes  the capabilities and potential actions of adversaries.  An adversary may be an eavesdropper on the network, a dishonest participant in the computation, or an otherwise honest participant whose system has been compromised.  Finally, the specific computation includes a description of the<br /> <br />function(s) to be evaluated.  This could be, e.g., a mathematical expression, a program in C code, or a Boolean circuit.</p>
<p>The wide variety of choices for these factors makes it a challenge to construct an MPC protocol whose performance is optimal for a particular application.  Integrating multiple MPC protocols or cryptographic primitives to create a novel solution to a larger secure computation problem is possible [KoSS09, KeSS13], but increases the complexity of the optimization problem even more.   Protocol design involves cryptographic experts carefully defining message sequences, data structures, cryptographic primitives, and a host of other parameters that are tuned for a specific application.   The design process is very sensitive to changes in the application requirements.   It is by no means clear that a protocol designed to be highly efficient for one application will be even close to optimal for a slightly different application.</p>
<p>The most basic requirements for a secure computation are that each input is kept confidential to the party that provided it, and the result is learned only by the intended recipient.   Any other information that can be learned by any party during the computation is likely to be a fatal security flaw for some application.   Therefore, existing general-purpose MPC protocols go to extraordinary lengths to hide all other information.  SPAR-MPC is based on the observation that if the "leakage" of some other information is acceptable or if there is an acceptable bound for the aggregate amount of this other information that can be learned over time, the protocol options may look very different and orders of magnitude gains in efficiency may be achievable.   The expected efficiency benefits warrant exploring ways to specify allowed leakage for otherwise secure computations,  an  important  deviation  from  standard  cryptographic  threat  models  for MPC.</p>
<p>End users would be well served to have a language in which to articulate allowed leakage to influence the protocol design process.  This means moving protocol design and specification as close to the end application as possible with easy-to-use tools.  Tools can help the end user make security priorities explicit, i.e., to decide whether an amount of leakage unacceptable as an average case is nevertheless acceptable as a low likelihood worst case.</p>
<p>The vision is to assist an organization with multiple MPC needs in selecting and deploying efficient protocols for each need, based on the characteristics of each application.   MPC applications for the same end user organization might range from big data analysis in the cloud to set intersection on short lists of items.   A  user knowledgeable about an intended MPC scenario, but not an expert in cryptographic protocols or MPC, could input application data into a future tool which will select or generate the definition of a cryptographic protocol and a proof of the protocol's security or data that can be used to prove the security of the protocol.  This does not preclude a generic proof that the generation tool will only produce provably secure protocols on well-formed parameters.   The definition of the cryptographic protocol would be in a programming language or in another executable specification [LM03, MNPS04, BNP08, SKM11], able to be compiled to machine code with dependence only on available commercial or open source cryptographic libraries.</p>
<p>Note that the vision is not to have a tool that helps select from among predefined protocols, but to have a tool that can automatically generate tailored protocols that are very efficient for novel applications.  This does not preclude the selection of an instance from within a parameterized<br /> <br />family of protocols, but it is desirable that a future tool would support a wide enough range of parameters that no single family of protocols could provide a practically efficient solution for all cases.   The envisioned tool might present the user with different protocols that satisfy the application constraints but have different efficiency/security tradeoffs or are efficient under different computation models such as the addition of additional parties.</p>
<p>Note that, for circuits, a general purpose garbled circuit compiler [MNPS04, BNP08, HEKM11] could provide an upper bound of performance from which to measure the sophistication of tools that can take concrete application parameters into consideration.   At the lower bound are the na&iuml;ve protocols that offer no security or privacy.  The research goal is to automatically generate tailored protocols that lie in between, and then help the end user make further choices by visualizing the tradeoffs and quantifying the overall cost of alternative protocols.  This RFI seeks ideas that illuminate the research challenges in making this vision a reality.</p>
<p>Request to Respondents</p>
<p>In this RFI we seek information about approaches to develop tools that automatically generate provably secure MPC protocols from information about specific applications.  To this end, we seek ideas on formalizing security and privacy constraints for MPC participants, formalizing the application characteristics such as tolerance for pre-computation, high bandwidth, or heavy computation loads, and measuring the tradeoffs between protocol efficiency and leakage.</p>
<p>It  is  very  difficult  to  enumerate  all  the  possible  ways  information  can  be  leaked  in  a cryptographic protocol and the consideration of side channel leakage (execution timing, memory usage, CPU usage, etc.) makes this more difficult.  It is also difficult to interpret the effects of such leakage on the confidentiality of the application data or the integrity of the overall computation.  Formalization and quantification of information available in access patterns, side channels, and other kinds of indirect disclosures are necessary to help non-specialists draw boundaries between intended, acceptable, and strictly prohibited learning by each participant in a specific end-user application.  This RFI seeks ideas for exploring, quantifying, interpreting, and articulating  the  tradeoffs  between  the  efficiency  gains  and  the  negative  side-effects  from allowing a specific leakage in a way that empowers end users to make informed risk acceptance decisions for each particular MPC application.</p>
<p>Additionally, the following ideas are in scope of this RFI: support for verifiable computation [GGP10], function privacy [Y86], malicious adversaries (including a malicious networking infrastructure [C00]), reusable cryptography [GKPVZ13], computation of arbitrary Random Access Machine (RAM) [LO13] or Random Access Stored Program (RASP) machine programs, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE) techniques [G09].  Restrictions to the two-party case are in scope, as this is a common scenario that may benefit from specialized tools.<br /> <br />Responses should address one or more of the following four topic areas:</p>
<p>1.	Formalization of Security and Privacy Constraints for MPC Protocols</p>
<p>This topic area especially includes identifying, formalizing, and quantifying leakage so that all information flows are explicit.</p>
<p>2.	Quantitative Metrics for Security, Privacy, and Efficiency of MPC Protocols</p>
<p>This  topic  includes  identifying  sound  metrics  for  measuring  progress  and  ultimate success of automatic protocol generation tools.</p>
<p>3.	Parameterized Families of MPC Protocols</p>
<p>This topic identifies and discusses current research in MPC protocols that are already parameterized or can be parameterized with respect to the security definition (beyond a simple security parameter), number of participants, available computational, communication, or storage resources, etc.</p>
<p>4.	Research Roadmap</p>
<p>This topic area includes discussing the challenges in developing tools for automatic generation   of   provably   secure   MPC   protocols,   tailored   to   concrete   application parameters, and proposing a research roadmap for getting to this end state.  A roadmap is a logical sequence of well-defined intermediate challenges that make cumulative progress toward the envisioned end state.</p>
<p>Responses may additionally discuss any other ideas noted as of interest in this RFI as far as the page limit allows.</p>
<p>Based in part on the results of this RFI, IARPA expects to hold a MPC workshop.  Participants will be selected primarily from respondents to this RFI. Such a workshop would likely explore the research challenges of implementing MPC protocol generation tools as described above, particularly as they relate to the structure of a potential future IARPA research program in this area.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for proposals. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)/National Institute on Aging (NIA) Research and Development Contracts Management Branch (R&amp;D CMB), on behalf of the NIMH, intends to negotiate a modification to an existing contract on a sole source basis pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253[c](1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, (Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirement) with:</p>
<p>Feinstein Institute for Medical Research<br />350 Community Drive<br />Manhasset, NY 11030</p>
<p><strong><br />BACKGROUND<br /></strong>Approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the United States experience a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. The early phase of psychotic illness is widely viewed as a promising opportunity for indicated prevention, and a chance to alter the downward trajectory and poor outcomes associated with serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Compared to traditional treatment approaches, programs that integrate pharmacologic, psychological, and rehabilitation interventions for FEP are associated with a range of positive outcomes, including remission of psychotic symptoms, lower-rates of re-hospitalization, shorter hospital stays, improved quality of life and social functioning, increased cognitive performance, and reductions in substance use. Studies also suggest that the timing of treatment is critical; short and long-term outcomes are better when individuals begin treatment close to the onset of psychosis.</p>
<p>"Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode," awarded on a competitive basis on 07/13/2009 to The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research (FIMR) under Contract HHSN271200900019C, is a cost-reimbursement research and development type contract and expires on September 20, 2014. Under this contract, FIMR developed and is testing a multi-component, coordinated FEP specialty care treatment program, termed "NAVIGATE." FIMR has enrolled 404 patients experiencing FEP into the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Seventeen intervention sites deliver NAVIGATE and 17 sites deliver enhanced standard community care. Patients enrolled in each condition are offered mental health care through the study for a minimum of two years. All participants have in-person research assessments conducted at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months; participants who enrolled early continue to receive assessments at 30 and 36 months. However, a knowledge gap exists with respect to the impact of the intervention over an extended period of time after the intervention has been delivered.</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to lengthen the assessment period by 36 months, from 2-3 years to 5 or 6 years (depending on participants' enrollment date), for participants already enrolled in the RAISE study, both in the NAVIGATE (intervention) and enhanced community care conditions, thus filling a knowledge gap regarding the extended impact of multi-component coordinated FEP specialty care.</p>
<p>FIMR is uniquely qualified to perform this work and the existing RAISE sample is uniquely poised to provide the most useful information in the timeliest and most cost efficient manner. Under the existing contract, the 34 RAISE clinical sites associated with FIMR have established ongoing clinical relationships with the enrolled RAISE participants. These patients have already participated in the research assessments for 2-3 years with good study retention, and are available to continue to participate in the same series of assessments. Existing IRB-approved protocols at all 34 RAISE study sites contain provisions to allow for rapid initiation of the proposed work, which involves continuing to conduct the same assessments already administered to the same RAISE participants but over an additional 36 months. The high retention rate among RAISE participants in the ongoing research assessments demonstrates that FIMR, with its existing research infrastructure and personnel, has successfully conducted the schedule of patient assessments and would be able to continue to conduct the same assessments for another 36 months. Furthermore, because the current contract has not yet ended, existing research staff can be retained to continue conducting the assessments during the contract extension without the need to hire and train new staff or perform start-up activities, such as developing research protocols and obtaining IRB approval across 34 sites. FIMR's conduct of the proposed work would leverage the Federal Government's resources already invested in establishing the RAISE research infrastructure and study.</p>

NOTE: JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. The Office of Acquisition Management is conducting this acquisition for NeuralStar Maintenance Renewal to Department-Owned NeuralStar Software on behalf of Information Resource Management, Enterprise Network Management Office (IRM/OPS/ENM).</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: New Purchase Order for commercial items. This procurement is for sole source only. The period of performance for this is 1/1/14 - 12/31/14.</p>
<p>3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department's needs: NeuralStar software provides a network-based, enterprise management solution that monitors and remotes manages all devices integrated into the network, isolates potential problems and catalogs recurring security events and provides streaming intelligence updates to users distributed across the network. The Department has a requirement for the following software upgrades and maintenance to Department-owned NeuralStar software:</p>
<p>Product Description/Part Number:<br />NeuralStar Annual Maintenance Renewal<br />- NeuralStar SNMP Fault and Performance Management Pack Supporting Failover (2Parent and 13 Child Nodes)<br />- TCP Management Interface Protocol<br />- Operator Clients<br />- Web browser Operator Client<br />- NeuralStar Design Suite DoS Order Number : SAQMMA10M2267<br />Kratos Project Number: MANT-079<br />NeuralStar Annual Maintenance Renewal<br />- NeuralStar SNMP Fault and Performance Management Pack Supporting Failover (2 Child Nodes)<br />- TCP Management Interface Protocol<br />- Operator Clients DoS Order Number : SAQMMA10F4846<br />Kratos Project Number: MANT-080<br />NeuralStar Annual Maintenance Renewal<br />- NeuralStar SNMP Fault and Performance Management Pack Supporting Failover (2 Child Nodes)<br />- Operator Clients DoS Order Number : SAQMMA11M1368<br />Kratos Project Number: MANT-094<br />NeuralStar Annual Maintenance Renewal<br />- SNMP Fault, Performance &amp; WWMI Management Package<br />- Operator Clients DoS Order Number : SAQMMA11M1857<br />Kratos Project Number: MANT-095<br /><br />4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: 41 USC 253(g) and FAR 13.501, Only One Responsible Source (Sole Source).<br /><br />5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited: The required items are a software product developed by NeuralStar and currently in use by DoS. They are the sole source provider of the upgrades, bug fixes and or enhancements based on the fact that they own the software and protect their source code. No other provider has the source codes to upgrade or modify the product. This product was chosen through a competitive evaluation by the Department of State whereby several products were evaluated. It took approximately 2 years to conduct this evaluation. This would be analogous to Microsoft, where you cannot obtain upgrades or bug fixes to Windows 7 from Apple or HP the code belongs to Microsoft. As compared to NeuralStar, no other company can put into operation software upgrades or augmentation. The proprietary software code support is available only from the original software manufacturer and its authorized partners, and therefore precludes consideration of any other brand.</p>
<p>6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: As this is a sole source justification, the Government has determined that only one responsible source is available; however, this justification will be publicized on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.2.</p>
<p>7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable: The Contracting Officer made a fair and reasonable price determination based on comparison of current purchase prices by other federal agencies and AQM historical data. The prices offered are within the range of those prices.</p>
<p>8. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted: Market research was conducted, as described in paragraph 7. The NeuralStar software licenses currently deployed are a proprietary software product that can only be maintained with additional proprietary software code through authorized software resellers of the original manufacturer - Kratos Technology &amp; Training Solutions, Inc. (A verification of customers prices from Kratos see attached email dtd: 1/16/2014)</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: As this is a sole source justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are used as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been identified as the only products that will meet the Department's requirements as part of the Department's storage environment.</p>
<p>10. A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: N/A</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: Acquisitions conducted under simplified acquisition procedures be publicized on FedBizOpps with the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, in accordance with FAR 5.2.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source cost type contract to Tufts University to provide a continuation of research and development services to the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), Project - RC-2119 entitled  quote mark Endangered Butterflies as a Model System for Managing Source-Sink Dynamics on Department of Defense Lands quote mark . <br>  <br> Project RC-2119 was selected through a competed solicitation BAA-10-0001 for funding in FY11.   Contract W912HQ-11-C-0050, was awarded on 03 May 2011 to the Harvard College with a 60 month period of performance.  Tufts University is uniquely qualified as the Principal Investigator (PI) of this project has moved from the Harvard College to Tufts University.  Completing this work relies on Government expertise, contacts with DOD land managers and endangered species biologists. The PI has the expertise to successfully lead the project to completion without a substantial duplication of effort for the remaining two and a half years. <br>  <br> Objective of Scope of Work: <br>  <br> Department of Defense (DoD) lands provide the best available habitat for numerous threatened, endangered and at-risk species (TER-S), and many of these species are currently managed on military lands by controlled disturbances (e.g. fires) or by de novo restoration of habitat. However, these management strategies run the risk of converting sources (where births exceed deaths) into sinks (where deaths exceed births) or of creating ecological traps - low-quality but attractive restored habitat that bleeds animals from nearby sources, threatening  metapopulation viability. Importantly, our work will focus on temporal change in habitat quality following management or restoration that may lead local habitat patches to cycle from sink to source status and back. <br>  <br> Objective: Through a combination of field studies and state-of-the-art quantitative models, it is proposed to use three species of endangered butterflies as a model system to rigorously investigate the source-sink dynamics of species being managed on military lands. Butterflies have numerous advantages as models for source-sink dynamics, including rapid generation times and relatively limited dispersal, but they are subject to the same processes that determine source-sink dynamics of longer-lived, more vagile taxa. <br>  <br> This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br>  <br> However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting officer within fifteen (15) days of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a cost type contract to Tufts University. <br>  <br> Point of contact for this requirement is Susan Hill at 703-428-6420 or susan.m.hill@usace.army.mil Address: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, HECSA, 7701 <br> Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22315. <br>

Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements. There is no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity. All calls/orders must be acknowledged by the selected vendor in order to be retained on the BPA calling list. The Government will not be issuing a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) because this notice will result in a sole source BPA.</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a Brand Name or Equal Small Business set-aside&nbsp;basis, to acquire three ChlorKing NEX-GEN 80R3T on-site chlorine generator systems to support the Acoustic Test Facility (ATF) Underwater Multi-Sensor Test Pool. The test pool is a 9-million gallon, lined pool. The NEX-GEN system is designed specifically for commercial size swimming pools. The NEX-GEN 80 has the capacity to produce eighty pounds of chlorine per day. The UMS test pool will require three of the NEX-GEN 80 systems to meet the chlorine requirement. The NEX-GEN system utilizes a salt hopper to house the required salt while other traditional salt chlorinators require salt to be added to the pool and maintained at a certain level. Salt would need to be added on a continuing basis as the salt level is reduced due to backwashing and dilution. The size of the UMS test pool makes a traditional salt chlorinator system impractical and cost prohibitive. Due to the presence of sophisticated equipment within the test pool, the continuous addition of salt creates unnecessary hazards of damaging this equipment. The NEX-GEN 80 system requires that no salt be added to the pool and recirculates the pool water so the amount of salt required to produce the chlorine is reduced over time. The NEX-GEN 80 system also produces pH neutral chlorine unlike traditional chlorine generators which have no pH control and result in additional chemical costs to regulate the pH levels. Lastly, the chlorination system must be compatible with the existing US Filter 42" Horizontal Sand Filter (model NFS-42-A-410) and Marlow 25 HP pump (model N844A).</p>
<p>Other offers will be considered on the basis that they meet or exceed the capabilities and performance of the NEX-GEN 80R3T system. Please submit any questions prior to 2 PM Central Standard Time on&nbsp;13 February 2014 in order to allow sufficient time to provide a response.</p>
<p>The RFP number is N61331-14-T-7001. The NAICS code is 221310 with a small business size standard of $25,500,000 and the FSC code is 4610. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a Firm Fixed Price contract. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. Delivery terms for this requirement are FOB Destination.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Vendors may obtain information on registration in the SAM by calling 1-888-606-8220, or via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov. Please note that defense payment office may not make payment unless the contractor is established to receive electronic funds transfer (EFT). EFT payments are based on the contractor's EFT information contained in the CCR database. The NSWCPC has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area. Therefore, this synopsis and any applicable amendments will be available at https://www.fbo.gov. Vendors should regularly access this web site to ensure that they have downloaded all amendments.</p>

<p>The following clauses and provisions are incorporated by full text. <br />52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)<br />52.212-3 -- Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items.<br />An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov .

CHRP is capable of producing approximately 1.5 million pounds of steam per hour; in 2011 the CHRP delivered approximately 1.5 million Klbs, with a peak winter load of 700 thousand lbs/hr. Steam is also used internally to operate steam driven equipment and auxillaries as well as the production of chilled water. The CHRP is the only steam-generating facilities serving in the GSA National Capital Region in operation. This plant provides steam servcie to over 29 GSA public buildings, 49 Federal non-GSA buildings and 12 Non-Federal buildings with a combined area of 52,000,000 gross square feet (GSF). The CHRP is comprised of 5 natural gas fired boilers using #2 fuel oil as back up fuel and 1 cogeneration boiler that operates with two 5MW combustion turbines generators that generates electricity utilizing the exhaust gas to produce steam. The cogeneration electricity is used primarily to power the chiller plant and augment heating operations.&nbsp;In 2011 the cogeneration system generated 75.7 K megawatt/hour of electricity. The CHRP operates a chiller plant that provides 17, 000 tons of cooling to eleven&nbsp;(11) customer buildings: in 2011 the CHRP circulated a total of 4.6 billion gallons of chilled water and supplied&nbsp;30.6 million tons of hours of cooling. The CHRP is a Level 5 security facility.<br /><br />

Box 3689 Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730 to retrofit four GMS computers part number 97-2271-000 with more rugged SMPTE-292 High Definition connrctors and to modify the four companion cooling trays that were fabricated to match this computer.

Firms that feel they can provide this commodity or equal or service are encouraged to identify themselves. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal, however, the Government will consider all proposals received by the specified due date (in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. 
If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602
Washington, D. C. 20593-0001

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO: 1. Change the stated deadline for proposals from 10 February 2014 3:00 PM (CST) to 24 February 2014 3:00 PM (CST). Changes in effect are identified with bold and underlined text. All remaining solicitation terms remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The 42nd Contracting Squadron, 50 LeMay Plaza, Bldg 804, Maxwell AFB, AL has a requirement for a Barbershop Concessionaire. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.</p>
<p>This combined synopsis/solicitation shall constitute the only announcement for this requirement. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. A Concessionaire Contract is contemplated. The solicitation reference number is FOX51Z31650100. The FAR, DoD supplements (DFARS), and Air Force FAR supplements (AFFARS) do not apply to Non-appropriated (NAF) procurement except as required by AFMAN 64-302 and AFI 64-301. Only those clauses required by law or otherwise stated in AFMAN 64-302 shall be mandatory. It is the offeror's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. The North American Industrial Classification Code is 812111. <br />IMPORTANT NOTE: THE GOVERNMENT IS SOLICITING FOR "OPEN MARKET" QUOTES ONLY. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (GSA) QUOTES WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.<br />The purpose of this contract will be to provide a Barbershop Concessionaire within the Maxwell Event Center (referred to as NAFI hereout), 101 E Selfridge St, Maxwell AFB, Al 36112, in accordance with the attached statement of work. This contract will be for a base period of one year beginning after contract award with four one-year options. The Maxwell Club Barber Shop will be operated 5 days a week excluding Saturday and Sunday and Federal Holidays, not to exceed forty (40) hours per week. Established hours are: Monday through Friday 9:00 am to 5:00 pm with (1/2 hour lunch). Lunch shall be taken between 2:00 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. The NAFI will furnish sufficient quantities of space, heat, water, and electricity to satisfy the normal needs of the Contractor for lighting, heating, drinking, sanitation, and the operation of suitable support equipment.

<p>Current Price List:<br /><br />Regular Hair Cut- $10.95<br />Complete Style- $15.00<br />This contract does not involve federal tax dollars. For more details, please see attached documents.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government will select the best overall offer based on the percentage of gross sales to be offered to the NAFI and past performance. For the purpose of the past performance/ percentage of sales, past performance shall be considered slightly more important than the percentage of sales. This may result in an award to a higher rated, lower percentage of sales offeror. Past performance shall be rated based on a Past Performance Questionnaire and any other performance history. <br />All offerors are required to submit past performance questionnaires for recent Barber Shop services (within the last five (5) years) to include, but not limited to, contracts or services provided on military installations. The government reserves the right to obtain performance information from any source it deems appropriate. More recent and relevant performance, relevant meaning government contracts, will have a greater impact on the past performance assessment than less recent or relevant performance. Offerors with no recent or relevant past performance information shall be given a neutral rating in this area. For more details, please see attached documents. <br />To be considered acceptable the offeror must accede to all of the requirements of this combined synopsis/solicitation and the attached documents (Concessionnaire Contract Agreement, Statement of Work, and Questionnaire), to include Specifications, and Additional Terms and Conditions to the Government's satisfaction.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840
Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840
The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp
If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the HQ AMC-Level Protest Procedures. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>Term is mandatory for lodging and hotel requirements. 
This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. 
For a proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor. 
All proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel shall provide the following: (1) Valid business insurance certificate. (2) Hotel agreement verified, and countersigned by both parties and the authorized agent of the participating hotel (hotel letterhead). 
(Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable). <BR> <BR>

(b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract."

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Amendment 0001<br /></strong>The purpose of this amendment 0001 is to (1) provide answers to questions. Attachment 3 - Answers to Questions is hereby attached hereto and incorporated herein. (2) As a result of the answers to questions, Attachment 1 has been revised as described in the answers to questions. Attachment 1 is hereby revised, attached hereto, incorporated herein and supersedes the previous version. The proposal due date remains unchanged. Proposals are due by 4:00 p.m. EST on 2/14/2014 in accordance with the Section L - Proposal Instructions.<br /><br /><strong>Combined Synopsis Solicitation <br /></strong>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />The solicitation number for this requirement is NTSB-R-14-0001. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).<br /><br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72.<br /><br />This requirement is issued as a total small business set-aside. The associated NAICS code is 541211, "Offices of Certified Public Accountants". The small business size standard of this NAICS code is $19M.<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong>In 1966, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established by statute as an independent Government agency located within the Department of Transportation for funding and administrative support. NTSB was made a wholly independent agency on January 3, 1975 when Congress approved the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974, Public Law 93-633, and began operation as such on April 1, 1975. Later, in 1996, the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act (Public Law 104-264) expanded the role of the NTSB to include coordinating victim and family assistance. In 1997, the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act extended the provisions of the 1996 Act to include foreign carriers operating in the United States. The NTSB is charged by Congress to investigate every civil aviation accident in the United States, most public-use aircraft accidents, and significant accidents in other modes of transportation, and to conduct special investigations and studies.<br /><br />In 2000, the National Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-424) gave the Office of Inspector General, Department of Transportation (DOT) responsibility over reviews over NTSB's financial management, property management, and business operations, including internal accounting and administrative control systems, and ensuring adherence with Federal laws, rules and regulations. . The Department of Transportation Inspector General (DOT IG) through a contract with an independent auditing firm audits the NTSB' financial statements each Government fiscal year. The independent auditor's report on the FY 2013 and FY 2012 financial statements identified a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting. That weakness involved the need to strengthen and document controls and processes related to posting journal vouchers and performing and following up on analytical procedures. Such controls and processes have been documented and implemented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description of Requirement<br /></strong>Based on the findings of the audit of the FY2013 and FY2012 financial statements, the NTSB requires financial services assistance of a Contractor to evaluate the corrective action plan (CAP) to correct the identified material weakness identified in the audit of its financial statements. Additionally, the Contractor shall provide other financial management support in the categories described that assist the NTSB in improving the financial management processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Review the Standard Form (SF) 18 and Attachments 1 and 2 which are attached hereto and incorporated herein for additional information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Basis for Award<br /></strong>The Government may award one (1) purchase order for one (1)&nbsp;base and up to four (4)&nbsp;option years to the responsible Contractor whose proposal that conforms to the RFQ, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other price factors considered, such that it provides the best value to the Government. Best value is defined as the procurement process that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government that is performed through an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis between price and non-price factors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the NTSB.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Clauses and Provisions<br /></strong>Review&nbsp;the SF 18&nbsp;which is attached hereto and incorporated herein for additional information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Submission of Proposals<br /></strong>Your proposal must be received no later than 4:00 p.m., EST, on February 14, 2014. LATE PROPOSALS MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.212-1.<br /><br />Offers may be transmitted via email to:<br />Bryan J. Moy<br />Email: bryan.moy@ntsb.gov <br /><br />The maximum size of an email, including attachments, which the NTSB email server can accept is 5 megabytes (MB). Therefore, the Contractor may choose to send their proposal in separate emails, if the combined file size of any email received by the NTSB email server will exceed 5MB. Contractors are encouraged to remove excess graphics from their proposals to ensure proposals remain under the file size limit. It is the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that the designated point of contact has received your proposal at the email address of the contact specified above by the proposal due date.<br /><br /><strong>Questions Regarding the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation <br /></strong>All questions regarding this combined synopsis/solicitation shall be directed to Bryan J. Moy via email at bryan.moy@ntsb.gov. ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 4:00 p.m. EST on February 7, 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Electronic Dissemination of Combined Synopsis/Solicitation <br /></strong>Access to this RFP and amendments will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website: www.fbo.gov. All Contractors are cautioned that it is your responsibility to frequently check back to the website to ensure that you have received all issued amendments.</p>

<DESC>Army Contracting Command- Warren issued a Market Survey for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) - Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP)/Full Rate Production (FRP) Phase. Please note the response date to the Market Survey was extended from May 1, 2013 to May 10, 2013. The Market Survey is an inquiry intended to measure the level of industry interest and industry ability in competing for a potential USG contract. Responses to this survey may influence the USG's decision to issue the subject solicitation under full and open competition. This is not a pre-solicitation notice or Request for Proposals (RFP). Nor will a contract be awarded from this announcement. Information provided regarding the potential contract as presented in this Market Survey is subject to change. Additionally, as a Market Survey, this inquiry does not bind the USG to solicit for or award a competitive contract. Participation in the survey is also wholly voluntary on the part of the contractor as no reimbursements will be made to any contractor for costs associated with their participation in the survey. Data submitted to the USG will not be returned but will remain archived as part of the survey's historic records. Lastly, participation in this Market Survey, while important to the Army and United States Marine Corp (USMC) acquisition planners, is neither mandatory nor is it requisite to future participation by the contractor in this or a similar contract RFPs. The link below will take you directly to PROCNET, where you will find the Market Survey. http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/majorsys/jltvfrp/jltvfrp.htm

<DESC>Request for Information on Commercial Sources for Solar Wind Data And Hosted Payloads
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>NOAA has received input from multiple Requests for Information (RFIs) on the subject of solar wind and and CME Imagery since 2003 indicating that there is a cost effective market capability and willingness to supply these observations through data sales and hosted payload opportunities. We wish to receive updated information on the market's capabilities and pricing data for these purposes.  We are also interested in receiving information from technology suppliers supporting such services (see Section IV below). In accordance with the 2010 National Space Policy and NOAA's longstanding policy and practice of making NOAA environmental satellite data available on a full and open basis, it is further anticipated that all data, either purchased under a commercial contract, or received from government furnished equipment (GFE) sensor flown on a commercial platform, will be freely available to the public.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />Geomagnetic storms are the type of space weather that causes the costliest and most widespread economic damage.  NOAA issues a geomagnetic storm alert based on in-situ solar wind measurements gathered from a platform on the sun-earth line.  NOAA currently uses data from the NASA&lsquo;s ACE satellite for this purpose, and will begin to use data from the DSCOVR mission in 2015.  Current satellite propulsion restricts those platforms to the L1 orbit giving approximately 15-60 minutes alert time.  We also issue storm condition watches of up to 3 days in advance based on the information from coronal mass ejection (CME) imagery acquired from NASA satellites, SOHO and STEREO.  We are planning for replacement of all these data streams in 2020, in a DSCOVR Follow On mission, and are seeking information on commercial options. Cost effective solutions are a primary concern.</p>
<p>I.	NOAA BASE SERVICES</p>
<p>All observations must be delivered with reliability sufficient to support forecasting requirements continuously and in real time (see Appendices A &amp; B).</p>
<p>1.	Solar wind data purchase: measurements must be made within 650,000 km of the sun-earth line at a distance of no further from the Sun than .99 AU (Sun-Earth L1).   Solar wind measurements made at duty stations closer to the sun than L1are desirable as they would be have a significant forecast advantage, but must meet reliability requirements.  We desire pricing information for purchasing data that meets these requirements which are more fully described in Appendix A.   We require both calibrated and uncalibrated data, and documentation of the calibration algorithms. Duration of service for the data purchase is 5-10 years.</p>
<p>2.	Hosted Payload Opportunity for Coronagraph:  NOAA is also interested in a hosted payload opportunity on the solar wind platform(s) for a GFE coronagraph(s), whose specifications are described in Appendix B.</p>
<p>DATA RECEPTION/GROUND SYSTEM</p>
<p>NOAA has a requirement to distribute its space weather forecast products within 5 minutes of the observation being acquired.  No ground data reception system has yet been designated for a DSCOVR F/O mission.  The DSCOVR and ACE missions use the Real Time Solar Wind Network (RTSWnet), an international collaboration including NOAA antennas at Wallops, VA and Fairbanks, Alaska for downlink.  There is no cost to NOAA for the participation of our international partners.  Responders may assume for planning purposes that the RTSWnet is functional for a DSCOVR F/O.  They are also free to suggest any other data delivery system they feel would be advantageous to the government.  (See also Optional Services)</p>
<p>RELIABILITY OF SERVICE</p>
<p>Solar wind data and CME imagery are delivered to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in Boulder, CO for use in critical space weather forecasts.  Solar wind data must be received at SWPC continuously within 5 minutes of observation.  CME imagery must be received within 15 minutes of observation. We are particularly interested in a detailed description of the architectural approach offerers would propose to achieve the government's need for reliability of service through commercial service.</p>
<p>USE OF ADVANCED PROPULSION</p>
<p>At the time of the release of this RFI there will not yet have been a demonstration of solar sail technology with sufficient navigational control to maintain artificial Lagrange orbits (ALOs) which would allow longer lead time for geomagnetic storm warnings or to hold positions out of the ecliptic.  However we are aware that such capability is likely to be demonstrated within the next two years.  Therefore the architectural solution space using solar sails is neither encouraged nor precluded in this Request.  If proposed service would employ solar sail technology, responders should take great care with their description of how they would ensure reliability of service.</p>
<p>II.	NOAA OPTIONAL SERVICES</p>
<p>NOAA is not committed to using the services described herein, but requests cost information on these potential services for planning purposes.</p>
<p>Data relay - NOAA does not yet have final plans for the ground system for a solar wind mission in the 2020 timeframe.  We currently use the RTSWnet. (See Appendix C)  If solar sail technology is sufficiently demonstrated in the 2020 timeframe we would be interested in the price of relaying our solar wind and CME imagery data through a satellite elevated out of the ecliptic at elevations between 23- 35 degrees to one or more of those stations.  (See also Additional Federal Agencies' Potential Interests)  Responders are free to address this option service as a supplemental operational demonstration that would not have to meet the reliability standard of operational service.</p>
<p>III.	ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AGENCIES' POTENTIAL INTERESTS</p>
<p>This RFI is released for the purpose of gathering estimated pricing information on cost-effective new services for NOAA requirements.  Responders may also wish to consider whether any of the NSF communication services requirements could be met using the architecture developed for NOAA's requirements and to provide pricing information for such services.</p>
<p>National Science Foundation (NSF)Antarctic Communications:  NSF has a requirement for communications from its Antarctic stations, including Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station located at the geographic South Pole.  NSF issued an RFI (2011) to industry for recommendations to address the unique challenges associated with providing high bit rate communications for South Pole Station, with particular interest on the exfiltration of large daily data volumes from South Pole Station to CONUS.  Not considered in the industry responses was the use of atypical space geometries. NSF is interested in the technical and economic feasibility for leveraging libration point orbits of interest to NOAA as opportunities for data relay services.  Data exfiltration requirements may be found in the requirements specifications associated with the 2011 RFI, located in the FedBizOpps archive at this web address:  https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NSF/DACS/DACS/NSF_SATCOM_RFI_2011/listing.html (see Attachment 1, United States Antarctic Program Communications Mission Needs Assessment, pp. 1-10).  NSF is interested in receiving information regarding commercial end-end data relay services, where NSF provides the South Pole earth station infrastructure and operations, as well as NSF terrestrial data network interconnection with a downlink reception station(s). South Pole Station uplink earth station sizing and downlink reception location are open parameters that should be included in the feasibility determination.  NSF intends to utilize this information for continuing alternatives analysis with current solution sets that use various combinations of legacy inclined operation geosynchronous satellites.<br />Finally, responders should be aware that copies of the hardware satisfying NOAA requirements could also satisfy certain requirements for NASA's Heliophysics and Near Earth Object Programs.  There is no schedule yet for these possible future procurements, information about the potential market is supplied for your consideration in business planning.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to add sole source information. <br /><br />The Department of Navy owns a software program that is tightly integrated with IntelliCAD. IntelliCAD provides the vector drawing engine that structures all of the geometry. At the same time, the software modules integrated with IntelliCAD generate the XML code that drives wiring modules. When the files are properly structured, this creates a conversion to generate the final graphics. This is an important step, because the software program maintains all of the IDs created in CAD and ensures that they are translated on a one-for-one basis with the geometry created. If the IDs are not translated correctly, none of the logic will work. You'd essentially end up with "dumb" SVG because the IDs in the SVG would have no reference in the XML. There is no way to simply replace the IntelliCAD software with something else; the nature of the IntelliCAD software required us to use IntelliCAD-specific calls contained within IntelliCAD code (not its API) to get IDs of the geometry created, set up menus and wizards, and construct the graphics in a way that could be understood in SVG. It's possible that software could be rewritten to replace IntelliCAD, but it would be a complete rewrite, and the output would have to be 100% compatible with the .dwg format because the SVG generation tool is invoked by the software, but is a separate application that only understands the .dwg format.
<p>The cost to replace the IntelliCAD portion of the software will far exceed the required yearly licensing fee. The time required to replace the IntelliCAD will place a significant scheduling burden on the programs who currently use the software.</p>

Changes to base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems, have been combined, resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235M, the USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Certain structures of the aircraft are constructed from glass fiber, reinforced plastic, aramid fiber, kevlar, carbon fiber, honeycomb sections, and poly vinyl protection films, such as TEDALAR. In addition, non-carbon panels are protected from lightening strikes utilizing a wire embedded mesh, or the application of anti-static paint. Dimple washers may be installed to protect sandwich panels from crushing loads when fasteners are tightened during panel installation to other structures, as well as, providing a means for electrical bonding. <br />The USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft are operated differently from general aviation in support of such Coast Guard missions as: Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, Logistic Support, and Law Enforcement Missions. These missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and other components. The aircraft, the engines and their components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) and require particular aircraft parts and accessory replacement to accomplish this task. Inspections of the aircraft routinely show evidence of corrosion of rivets and dimpled washers. Corrosion is caused by dissimilar material where foil or screen used as lightening and static protection comes in contact with OEM washers, poor installation of washers during panel construction, or lack of proper corrosion protection during manufacture.<br />USCG OBJECTIVES:<br />The USCG, Aviation Logistics Center, Elizabeth City, North Carolina is seeking alternate sources who are Federal Aviation (FAA) Part 145 authorized repair centers with the experience and facilities to perform aircraft composite repair on all component items listed in the attachment. Potential sources shall have access to the following Original Manufacture's Manuals (OEM):<br />CN235 Structural Repair Manual (SRM)<br />CN235 List of Consumable Materials (LCM)<br />CN235 Corrosion Control Manual<br />The Coast Guard does not own nor can it provide the SRM, LCM, and Corrosion Control Manuals.<br />Responses to this notice should include company name, address and telephone number, points of contact, and complete product details and brochures which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment and options. Also, state approximate repair times (from induction to delivery), provide details and terms of any standard warranty included with the repair services. Additionally, detail if the product has been qualified for use in any Department of Defense (DoD) or Federal Government Aircraft. The applicable NAICS code is 488190 - Maintenance and Repair Services, Aircraft. <br />REPLIES:<br />Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> On 29 August 2013, this Office, Army Contracting Command- New Jersey, Emerging Technologies (ACC-NJ-ET) received a request from U.S. Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Command (ARDEC) - Ben t Laboratories, located at Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, New York for the subscription with the Integrative Materials Design Center (iMdc).   The objective of this research center is to provide subscriptions to industry and Government personnel in order to fund research projects focused on preventing failure and improving the performance of structures through: evaluating the multi-scale behavior of materials, optimizing new materials and processing practices, and establishing microstructure/property/performance relationships. Specific research projects could involve fatigue testing, fracture mechanics evaluation, thermo-mechanical testing, additive manufacturing, non-destructive evaluation, etc. on metallic and composite materials of significant importance.  The Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) technical POC has determined this procurement's estimated value to be no more than $125,000.00. Therefore, the government anticipates using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures for this effort. Using Market Research and the rationale provided for in this Sole Source Justification, it is the intent of this Office to award a New Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order to the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), 100 Institute Road Worcester, MA 01609-2280. The authority cited is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). A Sole-source notice will be publicized on to the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) as required by subpart 5.2.  <br>  <br> The Integrative Materials Design Center (iMdc) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute was established in 2007 by Dr. Diana Lados as a one-of-a-kind consortium of government, industry, and academic partners. The objective of this research center is to provide subscriptions to industry and Government personnel in order to fund research projects focused on preventing failure and improving the performance of structures through: evaluating the multi-scale behavior of materials, optimizing new materials and processing practices, and establishing microstructure/property/performance relationships.  There are other government-industry-university consortiums that exist. However, they did not contain the technical breadth and scope of WPI's iMdc consortium which encompasses fatigue behavior, fracture mechanics, novel materials development, material processing, material design, additive manufacturing, etc. The iMdc is a unique and one-of-a-kind consortium that is directly applicable to the current ARDEC mission.  This determined our recommendation to award Sole-source to Worcester Polytechnic Institute.   <br>  <br> Worcester Polytechnic Institute is the only institution that can perform the tasks in the listed SOW due to the following reasons:  <br>  <br>  <br> -	WPI's Integrative Materials Design Center (iMdc) is a unique university / industry / government consortium that participates in research projects of direct interest to DoD/ARDEC. Subscribers have direct input into the research performed by WPI students.  The subscription leverages funding in order to perform basic and applied materials research that would otherwise not be able to be performed. An example is a current iMdc project on  quote mark Additive Manufacturing: Microstructure, Properties, and Damage Mechanisms quote mark . This project falls within the ARDEC mission and is performing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of fundamental research on additive manufacturing. All data and licensing rights are available to Subscribers at no cost. <br>  <br> -	It is critical that scarce R&D dollars be leveraged in order to perform fundamental materials research of interest to DoD/ARDEC. The work performed by iMdc is aligned with ARDEC's mission and enables materials research (e.g. related to fatigue, fracture mechanics, materials processing, manufacturing science, computational materials engineering, etc.) that would otherwise not be able to be performed due to funding limitations. <br>  <br> -	Multiple projects are performed by iMdc each year under the cost of a Subscription. <br> If these projects were to be performed at other university/universities, multiple contracts would need to be awarded. This would take an inordinate amount of time and would cost many times more than if the work were to be performed at iMdc (in which the Subscription dollars are leveraged to provide a much greater  quote mark return on investment quote mark ). <br>  <br> -	If other universities are capable of performing this unique and specific materials <br> R&D, multiple contracts would have to be written to perform each project. The anticipated value of each project performed by iMdc is $250K. Over a five year period, it is anticipated that 10 projects shall be performed by iMdc.  The time to prepare and award the 10 contracts to other universities is estimated to be 30 man months.  This would cost an estimated $2.5M if performed elsewhere. The leveraging capability of iMdc ($125K/5 years) enables world class materials research at an extremely affordable price that cannot be duplicated elsewhere. <br> 	 <br> In addition;  multiple contracts would need to be awarded if the work was performed at other universities, delays of six months to two years are anticipated because of the additional manpower and time needed to process multiple contracts.  These delays are unacceptable because they would not be able to keep tempo with the pace at which new materials solutions are needed at ARDEC to support the Warfighter. For example, a current project at iMdc on additive manufacturing will enable novel processed such as Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) to be performed on critical armament components in order to reduce scrap, reduce the logistics burden, extend life, and reduce total life cycle costs. If such a project were delayed by contracting with another university, there would be a six month to two year delay in generating the critical materials data needed to certify the process. This could result in delays in production schedules, potential materiel shortages, and would adversely affect Warfighter readiness. <br>

<DESC>This firm-fixed-price contract is for conducting a survey at Superstition Hills on the Naval Air Facility El Centro, CA and analyzing and inverting data collected at the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range, Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, AZ Glamis prospect. In the Fall of 2012, the Government obtained Air-FTG and Aeromagnetic data over the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range, Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, AZ Glamis prospect. The data was collected via aircraft for 58 lines with 200 meter spacing that were 13 kilometers long. The total length of the survey was 752 linear kilometers and covered an area of 150 square kilometers. The data was acquired and processed by Bell Geospace, Inc. This data was collected to add to the Navy Geothermal Program Office's understanding of the structural controls on a possible geothermal resource for the Glamis prospect. The Contractor will collect ground gravity data within the Superstition Hills on the Naval Air Facility El Centro, CA. The Contractor will create a survey based on points provided by GPO, collect the data, invert and merge the data sets with existing regional gravity. This information will help GPO better understand the regional geologic setting of the Superstition Hills and, when compared with other geologic and geophysical data sets, will lead to a better understanding of a possible geothermal resource.
