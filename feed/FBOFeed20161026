<DESC>PROJECT TITLE: NEXRAD Radar DC Servo Motors
<p>LOCATION OF WORK: Vendor's Facility</p>
<p>NAICS CODE: 335312, Motor and Generator Manufacturing. The small-business size standard is 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>SET-ASIDE STATUS: Small Business Set-Aside</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking sources capable of providing new DC Servo-motors to be used in the NEXRAD WSR-88D Antenna Positioning System that is a form, fit, function, replacement of the legacy DC Servo Motor, and is compatible with the existing servo amplifier and servo choke.</p>
<p>NEXRAD (Next-Generation Weather Radar) is a network of 168 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). NEXRAD detects weather events and is the primary detection system used by the NWS to support issuance of severe weather warnings, and used by the FAA and USAF to support safety of flight operations. The WSR-88D Radar Operations Center (ROC) is responsible for complete life-cycle support of the radar network including system engineering, configuration management, and logistics analysis and support.</p>
<p>Each servo-motor is interchangeable between axis (Azimuth and Elevation) and shall be designed to accommodate this function and shall be in-field serviceable. NOAA is not seeking vendors to design, develop, and then produce this requirement; we are seeking vendors already capable of providing a working solution, as there are known sources of motors in the marketplace which meet all requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting all requirements of the attached Vendor Item Drawing (VID), any product proposed to support this requirement shall not have proprietary limitations that restrict the future repair of the motor to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).</p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of manufacturing and delivering up to 500 DC Servo Motors, P/N 2200220-201 or equivalent. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) was Electo-Mechanical Systems.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics of the DC Servo Motor are documented in the attached Vendor Item Drawing (VID), number 2200220-201. There are 3 sources for the DC Servo Motor documented in the VID as "suggested sources". These suggested sources have previously provided motors for test and evaluation for use in the WSR-88D NEXRAD radar that have demonstrated their ability to be compliant with all requirements. Any product that is proposed shall meet all requirements of the VID without significant modification. If a commercial product, other than those listed in the VID, meets all requirements, a sample will be requested to support Government inspection and testing in order to validate suitability of the product.</p>
<p>All dates listed below are tentative dates. Official dates will be provided when the solicitation is released.</p>
<p>TENTATIVE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: November 10, 2016</p>
<p>TENTATIVE PROPOSAL DUE DATE: November 20, 2016</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED AWARD DATE: December 20, 2016</p>
<p>DELIVERY TIMEFRAME: January 20, 2017 - November 24, 2017</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION: To be eligible for award, a contractor must (1) be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov.

<p>No set aside decision has been made; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Nov 2011) ... (c) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern... ". Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.</p>
<p>If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>ATTENTION all potential respondents:</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy for this program has not been finalized. If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on the requirement and what areas are likely candidates for SB subcontracting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part II. Capability Survey Questions</p>
<p>1. Is your firm registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), formally known as Central Contractor Registration (CCR)? In accordance with federal regulations, all contractors doing business with the federal government must be registered in the SAM database.</p>
<p>2. Describe briefly the capabilities of the nature of the services you provide.</p>
<p>3. Describe your company's past experience on previous with similar services. Include contract numbers, a brief description of the work performed, period of performance, agency/organization supported, and individual point of contact (Contracting Officer or Program Manager).</p>
<p>4. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that we provide that would currently preclude your product/service from being a viable solution to our requirement?</p>
<p>5. Are there established market prices for our requirement? If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public? Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions? Briefly describe any differences.</p>
<p>If your company is interested, submit your responses to jessica.stamper.2@us.af.mil. E-mail responses should be received no later than 5:00 pm EST on 09 November 2016.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify to the Government potential sources interested in this procurement. The Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Software Engineering Center (SEC) Enterprise Information Systems Directorate (EISD) Satellite and Systems Management Division (SSMD) is responsible for providing Post Production Software Support (PPSS), program management, analysis, system architecture, software engineering, system engineering, requirements management, information assurance, lab facility management, formal review requirements, required deliverables, incidental travel, equipment responsibilities and utilization, and technical support to the Multiplexer Integration and Digital Communication Satellite Subsystem (DCSS) Automation System (MIDAS). The MIDAS application assembly language, microprocessors, and software development facility test bed were developed by, and are proprietary to, Raytheon. The Government does not possess a Technical Date Package (TDP) for the MIDAS. The Raytheon Company is the incumbent.
<p>Background</p>

<p><br />SECTION I</p>
<p>1. Product Manager Allied Tactical Vehicles (PdM ATV), located at the United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC) in Warren, Michigan, seeks to identify sources capable of standing up a High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) Overhaul Program in Afghanistan. The purpose of the HMMWV Overhaul program is to defray the cost of purchasing new vehicles through a near zero mile/hour overhaul of HMMWVs for the Afghan National Defense Service Forces (ANDSF). Although multiple HMMWV configurations have been purchased over multiple years, the USG plans to reduce the number of HMMWV configurations to reduce complexity, logistics footprint, and improve maintenance standardization for the ANDSF.</p>
<p>The end products of this program shall be HMMWV models M1151A1B1 with Fragmentation Kit Five (FK5), M1152A1B2 with Troop enclosure and with FK5, or M1152 with Ambulance Box; Burtek brand, non-U.S. ARMY, (depending on the inducted vehicle per the following table) compliant with the applicable Technical Data Package (TDP). Only HMMWV serial numbers 300000 and above will be inducted into the Overhaul Program.</p>
<p>Receive:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overhaul/Recap To:&nbsp;<br />M1151A1B1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M1151A1B1 w/ FK5<br />M1151A1B1 w/ FK5</p>

<p>The U.S. Government (USG) will provide an estimated 1000 vehicles per year to the contractor for the HMMWV Overhaul Program. Upon completion, overhauled HMMWVs will be transferred to the USG for return to the ANDSF. The Government shall provide the facility of operation for the overhaul program, and the contractor will be responsible for setting up the production line, to include providing tooling and equipment, and operating the facility. See attachment 001 for an overview of the proposed Government provided facility. The Government may elect to utilize only a portion of the space identified in attachment 001 for the HMMWV Overhaul Program as needed.</p>
<p>The USG is contemplating an acquisition that will include the use of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and/or Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) type contract arrangements (ref. FAR 16.204 and 16.304). If awarded, the contract will have a five-year period of performance with a one-year base and option periods. The contractor shall procure and provide all parts necessary to provide overhauled vehicles. The output of this program is overhauled vehicles. The vehicle overhaul program shall include:</p>
<p>a. Mandatory Replacement Parts (FFP):</p>
<p>i. Major component replacement or overhaul, see attachment 002.</p>
<p>ii. Replacement of all drive belts, bulk hose and filters as new</p>
<p>b. Inspect and Repair Only As Necessary (IROAN) (CPIF):</p>
<p>i. All components not designated for mandatory replacement shall be inspected for serviceability, see attachment 003.</p>
<p>ii. All required repairs and mandatory maintenance tasks shall be performed IAW the Technical Manuals (TM), Technical Bulletins (TB) and Technical Data Package (TDP).</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE posted for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY and will be used to assist the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in determining the availability of eligible Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HUB Zone, women-owned small business, and 8(a) with the technical capability necessary to successfully perform the requirements described herein. Only proposals submitted by 8(a) small businesses (certified as small businesses at the time of proposal submission) will be accepted by the Government. Any proposal that is submitted by a contractor that is not a certified 8(a) small business will not be considered for award.
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERIVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.</p>
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY TO OBTAIN CONTRACTOR SUPPORT SERVICES TO PERFORM THE SAME OR SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTICE. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) MAY OR MAY NOT ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE SUBMISSION OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT; ACCORDINGLY, CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THE RESULTS OF THE MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p><br />Background:<br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is an Agency of the US Department of Health and Human Services. CMS oversees three major programs:<br />1. The Federal Medicare insurance program that provides health insurance to people age 65 or older and certain people under 65 with disabilities or end-stage renal diseases.</p>
<p>2. The State based Medicaid program that provides health insurance to people with low income.</p>
<p>3. The Health Insurance Marketplace that allows people under 65 to buy health insurance from private health plans.</p>
<p>The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) is one component within CMS.<br />There are three legislative drivers that created CMMI and guide its work.</p>
<p>Affordable Care Act (ACA)<br />The intent of the ACA is to transform the healthcare system by increasing access to care and reforming the delivery system by improving quality and lowering the cost of care. CMMI, which was created through section 3021 of the ACA, is focused on delivery system and payment reform.</p>
<p>Medicare Access &amp; CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) Section 101<br />MACRA Section 101 enhances CMS' and CMMI's ability to achieve delivery system reform by moving more quickly towards paying for value and better care. MACRA Section 101 creates the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) to replace current CMS programs that measure quality and encourage the meaningful use of certified Electronic Health Records (EHR). MACRA Section 101 also creates Alternative Payment Models (APM) that provide new ways to pay providers for the care they give Medicare beneficiaries. CMMI is the business owner for APMs.</p>
<p>MACRA Section 501 <br />MACRA Section 501requires CMS to replace the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) on the Medicare beneficiary card with a new number that does not contain the Social Security Number (SSN). CMMI has several models, systems, and reports that it must remediate for the SSN Removal Initiative.</p>
<p>CMMI:</p>
<p>To achieve its mission and vision, CMMI constructs and manages a portfolio of models that test new ways for CMS to pay for care, measure and incentivize quality, and collaborate with the healthcare industry and beneficiaries. A model tests an intervention in the Medicare or Medicaid programs for a defined set of beneficiaries, providers, conditions, treatments, and/or population.</p>
<p>CMMI currently has approximately 40 model tests and continually develops and implements new models. One model may require multiple systems and services from CMMI and other CMS components. This contract would provide a subset of required systems for CMMI models.</p>

<DESC>The attached SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is issued for the purposes of planning and market research only. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and does not obligate the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Service (CMS) to award a contract.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></p>
<p>The Integrated Data Repository (IDR) is the centerpiece of CMS' Enterprise Data Warehouse Strategy. The IDR responds to the agency's critical need to have an integrated data environment that contains Medicare claims, beneficiary, provider, and plan data.

Payment grade is defined as automated validation that the data loaded into the IDR is exactly how it was received from the sending source, the installation and enforcement of internal controls to maintain separation of duties, as well as automated reporting and reconciliation processes in place, confirming the data that was actually loaded. In most cases reporting is automated, however all reconciliation is manual.</p>
<p>The Integrated Data Repository (IDR) include Project Management, Change Management, Release Management, Quality Management, Project Strategist, Architects, Leads, Developers, Analysts, Data Modelers, Testers and other resources as determined necessary by the Contractor in order to provide the following services for all IDR Platforms (currently Teradata, Hadoop, and Mainframe):<br />&bull; Data Receipt and Control<br />&bull; Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)<br />&bull; Utility and Application Program Interface (API)<br />&bull; EFT Code and Processes <br />&bull; Virtual Data Mart (VDM)<br />&bull; IDR Strategic Planning<br />&bull; Technical and Data Architecture Support <br />&bull; Data Profiling and Modeling <br />&bull; Hadoop/Teradata Integration<br />&bull; Integrated Release Planning and Support<br />&bull; IDR Testing (changes and upgrades)<br />&bull; IDR Core Documentation<br />&bull; Data Lab support<br />&bull; IDR User Support Helpdesk<br />&bull; BI Support (maintain dashboards, fulfill requests) <br />&bull; Data Validation and Reporting<br />&bull; User Group Support<br />&bull; Continuous Improvements</p>

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.

<p>Background:  The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the NIH, and conducts research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.</p>
<p>The Translational Neuroscience Center (TNC) Clinical Proteomics Unit (CPU) provides NINDS clinical investigators with access to state-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based proteomics technology. CPU is also tasked with development of analytical mass spectrometry-based methods for proteomic analyses of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to both identify and quantify changes in the CSF proteome associated with neurological disorders.</p>
<p>Currently, CPU is developing innovative methodologies with the goal of identifying candidate biomarkers in disease state versus control analyses. The development of CSF biomarkers is the best possible novel outcome for therapeutic development in different neuroinflamatory and neurodegenerative conditions. Candidate biomarkers would be screened for selectivity and specificity using absolute quantitative methods on this instrument.  In the event that an investigator has pre-determined candidate biomarkers, from alternate methodologies or literature review, the discovery phase can be omitted and the investigator can proceed directly to biomarker validation.</p>

<DESC>DNA is used by multiple components of the United States (U.S.) government for identifying individuals, detecting and diagnosing medical conditions, and for determining family relationships. Depending on the circumstances, DNA samples can be obtained through consent from a witting individual, or they can be forensically recovered from left behind cells. All cells (e.g., skin, hair, blood, saliva, etc.) contain DNA. In support of scenarios where a forensic DNA sample is recovered from an unknown person, IARPA would like to investigate using genetic DNA phenotyping to provide investigative or intelligence leads for identifying the person by providing a possible face structure and appearance of the unknown person. Advancements in genetic phenotyping suggests the possibility of predicting a human's facial structure or other attributes from DNA sequences. IARPA is interested in knowing whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) yield sufficient information for making such prediction or if the whole genome sequence is required. If it is possible to develop a robust genotype to phenotype face prediction model, additional information will be required to determine the required sample size of the training dataset. The DNA training dataset would be used for developing the technology or algorithms required to create the training models. An additional ground truth dataset that contains known face images of the individual will be required to then test the accuracy of the training models and predictive algorithms. These DNA SNP and whole genotype databases, along with the corresponding ground truth face images, would need to be created if not already available for government use. Consideration must be made for determining the appropriate population that should be solicited for developing the training and testing datasets.<br />

<DESC>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
<p>SUBJECT: Sole Source Justification - Development of elementary school curriculum modules that align with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). <br /><br />The Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) is creating a new product line of elementary school curriculum that aligns to the NGSS. This curriculum is being developed in phases. The Smithsonian Institution hereby provides notice of its intention to issue a sole source stand-alone contract with Rainbow Educational Concepts, Inc. for curriculum development services. The contractor will complete a previously approved Scope of Work required to develop nine science and engineering curriculum modules aligned to NGSS standards across grades 3 through 5 . The price of the contract&nbsp;is $1M.</p>
<p>Rainbow created the 4th grade Energy module under a separate contract. The 4th grade module will be pilot tested in Fall 2016. SSEC is now scaling up to develop a total of 9 new science and engineering modules that will follow the same format as the 4th grade Energy module. The contract will be awarded as a sole source based on the fact that this is a follow-on purchase requiring the use of a previous source for compatibility with a previous purchase. Rainbow's writers have been trained on both the NGSS and the pedagogy utilized for SSEC's elementary modules. In addition, Rainbow will give SSEC direct access to those writers, allowing the project to be completed on an expedited basis in order to meet SSEC publishing deadlines and at a savings to the Smithsonian.</p>
<p>Rainbow Educational Concepts&nbsp;has the means, technical skill and requisite knowledge for developing the additional modules on the compressed schedule required to meet the SSEC's publishing deadlines, ensuring SSEC can meet state curriculum adoption deadlines. It is the Smithsonian's position that awarding this contract to any contractor other than Rainbow would likely result in the project not being completed prior to those deadlines causing serious impact to SSEC's revenue source and that the duplication of costs would exceed what would be gained through competition.<br /><br />For subcontracting opportunities, contact:<br />Rainbow Educational Concepts, Inc.<br />Attn: Brian Smith, President and COO<br />4147 N. Ravenswood Ave., Suite 301<br />Chicago, IL 60613</p>

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting proposals for award of an other transaction (OT) agreement for the Mobile Force Protection (MFP) program under DARPA's authority to award other transactions for prototype projects under 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2371b.  The MFP program is an advanced technology prototype development program that will develop and demonstrate an integrated prototype system capable of defeating a raid of self-guided, small Unmanned Aircraft Systems attacking a high value asset on the move.  The program will include a three-phase developmental cycle with each phase building upon the capability of the previous phase.  It seeks to develop an integrated system capable of providing protection to ground or naval convoys against self-guided sUAS and, to the extent possible, other asymmetric threats.  At this time, DARPA is soliciting proposals for Phase 1 only and for the subsequent optional field evaluation, as well as rough order of magnitude (ROM) proposals for Phases 2 and 3.  Refer to the attachments of this notice for a complete detail of the Program Solicitation, DARPA-PS-17-01.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 and FAR 13 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is N00244-16-T-0301 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-91 effective 30 September 2016.  Solicitation is 100% Small Business Set-Aside and the associated NAICS code is 325120 and small business size standard is 1,000.
  Requirement as follows:
CLIN 0001 QTY 1 Lot Bulk Propane and Delivery Total Estimated Quantity of 42,400 gallons delivered at 6 Naval facilities located in California  see attached Requirements Description/Delivery Schedule.
 Delivery/Period of Performance:  15NOV2016  14NOV2017; FOB Destination  various locations  see attachment
The FAR provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding any addenda to the provision.
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
 (i) Technical capability of the item offered to meet the government requirement;
(ii) Past performance; and
(iii) Price
Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price. 
Offerors proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  A will comply statement without accompanying technical specifications and/or drawings of product being offered is automatic failure under this factor.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and may be removed from further competition.
  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those Offers that are rated acceptable in Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii), and (iii).  Contract will be awarded to the offeror who is found acceptable in Factors (i) and (ii) and is the lowest price offer.

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

(b)  Technical capability of the item offered to meet the government requirement.  This factor has following sub-factors as follows:

1)	Licensed propane dealer in California
2)	Delivery Schedule to include statement of being able to deliver propane within 24 hours of order during emergency conditions; 

Quote shall include a statement confirming compliance with subfactors 1) and 2) above to receive rating of acceptable in Factor (i).
  It is in the discretion of the Contracting Officer to decide whether to accept as acceptable proposed later delivery schedule  i.e. more than 24 hours during emergencies if only one quote is received.

(c)  Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. Offers that lack relevant past performance history, will receive a neutral rating under this factor.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.  Neutral rating will be rated as acceptable.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offerors past performance.  Satisfactory rating will be rated as acceptable.

UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offerors past performance.  Unsatisfactory rating will be rated unacceptable.
(d) Price quote.  
(1) Bulk propane pricing shall include the following:
- Pricing summary using Table 1 format from attachment; 
- Offeror shall include the pricing formula/methodology used in its quoted price to include the propane index (or market indicator), markup, and current IFF rate used - see below.
(2) Total Price will be the sum of all prices under Extended Price column and will be the evaluated price.
(3) The Pricing formula will be incorporated in the resulting contract and shall be used as basis for requesting for Economic Price Adjustment (see FAR 52.216-2).
(4) A single-award Fixed Price contract with Economic Price Adjustment will be awarded to the quote that received ratings of acceptable in Factors (i) and (ii) and is the lowest evaluated price.
(e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
 Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

GRAND TOTAL






CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM (CPARS)
As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed
$150,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials.  The FAR requires that the contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing. To fulfill this requirement VA uses an online database, CPARS, which is maintained by the Naval Seal Logistics Center in Portsmouth Virginia.  CPARS has connectivity with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies.
PPIRS is the system used to collect and retrieve performance assessment reports used in source selection determinations and completed CPARS report cards transferred to PPIRS. CPARS also includes access to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS). FAPIIS is a web-enabled application accessed via CPARS for contractor responsibility determination information.
Each contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $150,000 is required to register with CPARS database at the following web address:  www.cpars.csd.disa.mil.  Help in



registering can be obtained by contacting the Customer Support Desk at 207-438-1690. Registration should occur no later than thirty days after contract award, and must be kept current should there be any change to the contractor s registered representative.
For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete.  For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the contractor s performance annually.  Interim reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed. The report shall be assigned in CPARS to the contractor s designated representative for comment. The contractor representative will have thirty days to submit any comments and re-assign the report to the VA contracting officer.
Failure to have a current registration in the CPARS database, or to re-assign the report to the VA contracting officer within those thirty days, will result in the Government s evaluation being placed on file in the database with a statement that the  contractor failed to respond.

Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) must be verified for ownership and control and listed in the Vendor Information Pages at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov when proposals are submitted and at the time of award. (See Clause 852.219-10 VA Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside.) Offers received from concerns that are not Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns shall not be considered and will not be evaluated.
Evaluation Process:  The Government will use a  Best Value Tradeoff  approach to select the awardee. Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors, listed as shown below:

Past Performance: Past performance will be evaluated for quality, schedule (timeliness), business relations, problem resolution, management of key personnel, safety, price/invoice control, regulatory compliance and overall performance. In addition, the Government will evaluate the relevance of your past performance (i.e. experience in providing services similar in size, scope, and complexity as described in the Statement of Work (SOW)).  If no past performance information is readily available the Offeror s past performance will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably.
Provide at least three (3) references to include same or similar work.  Use Past Performance Questionnaires. You must include accurate and current POC name, telephone numbers and email address with each reference. The Government will not research contact phone numbers or emails.  If a reference cannot be reached with the information provided, the offeror will not get credit for that referral.  However, the absence of past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably. References that are not comparable in size, scope and value to the solicited requirement may be given less consideration.

Provide feedback from past participant surveys, if available


Technical/Quality: Offerors must provide information for the following sub-factors, which are weighted equally:
Experience of company and/or subcontractors in performing this type of work: extensive leadership/professional development experience (prior experience working in the Federal sector is required) Based on summary of professional qualifications, (rsums of key technical personnel, certifications, etc.)

Experience producing and delivering training of a similar nature and scope: have you done/performed services described in the Statement of Work? Please explain in detail, (include the Description, Size, Scope, Dollar Value of similar projects).

Offerors shall provide the following: Learning objectives and a detailed lesson plan/course outline as part of the submitted proposal. Any proposed subcontractors listed and their socioeconomic status (e.g., Disabled/Veteran owned, Woman owned, Small, Large Business, etc)   list the type and percentage of work the Prime Contractor will perform and that the subcontractor will perform. Provide any additional information that will assist in understanding your plan/approach and superiority in providing services.


Price: Price analysis will be conducted to determine a fair and reasonable price. The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair and reasonable price. For evaluation purposes the offered price will be determined by calculating the total price of Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) in order to determine a total amount. The lowest priced proposal may not necessarily receive the award. This is not an Invitation for Bid.
Past performance and technical, when combined, are significantly more important than price. 
The Government will research information and databases to aid in establishing contractor s responsibility and ability to perform. The databases include, but are not limited to Experian, PPIRS, SAM.gov, VetBiz and SBA.
The Government retains the right to award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to provide their best proposals with the materials requested for evaluation.

Failure to submit all required documentation as required may result in your submission being found to be technically unacceptable.

d). The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))

IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.

2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
This is a Brand Specific Justification.
Vasoview Hemopro Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting System (EVH): Vasoview Hemopro 3500 (VH3500) is used for endoscopic vessel harvesting system (EVH).  The outdated VH2400 currently in use will have reached its medical capabilities once all supply has been exhausted, VH3500 is a newer, safer upgrade to the VH2400 


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED: The SLCVAMC already owns the equipment (VASOVIEW Power supply/cable) used for Vein harvesting from Maquet.  The HemoPro endoscopic Vessel Harvesting system (VH-3500) is the only EVH that can be used with this equipment.


4.  SUGGESTED SOURCE INFORMATION (Contractor Name, Address, City, State,  Zip, and Telephone Number) 
MAQUET Cardiovascular, LLC
1717 Washington Street
45 Barbour Pond Drive, Wayne, NJ 07470


5.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES: 
The system needs to be compatible with the endoscopic system that we currently have in the OR. 
This system is already in operation and it is not cost effective to replace the entire system.


6. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market research was conducted to identify small business distributors for the Vaso View 3500.

AHERA SURVEY


AMENDMENT A00001

This amendment is to extend the due date to read as follows: Due Date: October 27, 2016.
The following question has been submitted to the Contracting Officer regarding this solicitation.

The question and response represent all questions submitted to the Contracting Officer prior to the deadline established in Solicitation No. VA256-17-Q-0029 as of 11:00 a.m., C.S.T., 27 October 2016. 

No more questions accepted.  

Bidders are instructed to submit their bids in response to the solicitation  as-is .  
Any remaining issues will be addressed with the successful bidder.  

Questions and responses are provided for bidder s information and use.

Vendor question 1:  What date does the VA intend to make award and provide NTP by? Given the extraordinarily 
short time frame within which to complete the work (all work to be completed by Dec 30), ANY delays beyond the 
solicitation submittal due date could easily jeopardize the project schedule.

VA response A1:  Upon award. Work shall begin within 5 days of notice to proceed.

Vendor question 2:  Given such little time for project completion (based on my extensive experience with asbestos
 inspections of VAMCs of this size), would the VA allow the contractor to complete the field sampling, laboratory
 analysis and cursory tabulation of results to be communicated to VA by Dec 30, but allow for reporting to extend
 beyond Dec 30?

VA response A2:    No.  As stated in the SOW, there should be no field sampling or laboratory analysis.
 
Vendor question 3: Will the VA provide the contractor with editable versions of all existing electronic files, including
 CAD, spreadsheet, database and report narratives, which were used to prepare the 2013 inspection/O&M report? And
 if so, can these files be shared with contractor immediately upon NTP? The timeliness of this document review
 process is absolutely critical to the schedule.

VA response A3:  Yes

Vendor question 4: Will the VA ensure that the contractor is provided with immediate and unlimited access to
 historical utility drawings for review purposes? 

VA response A4:  Yes

Vendor question 5: Will the VA ensure the contractor is provided with immediate and unlimited access to all
 Available  historical asbestos remediation project closeout reports received since the last inspection report? 

VA response A5:  Yes

Vendor question 6: Can the VA provide the contractor with immediate and unlimited access to historical building
 renovation records such that the contractor could ascertain the nature and extent of renovation efforts carried out in
 each building/space? 

VA response A6:  Yes

Vendor question 7: Were existing asbestos TSI components fitted, partially or in whole, with appropriate asbestos
 warning labels/signage during past inspection efforts, including the 2013 assessment? If only partially completed, can
 the VA provide an approximate percentage of the total Vendor Question uantity that has been properly labeled?

VA response A7:  Yes

VENDOR QUESTION 8: Can the contractor assume that if a given observable flooring system has been assessed a
 part of past inspections (i.e. the top layer of tile matches the description of past assessments), may the contractor
 assume that any underlying layers of flooring/adhesive were also assessed as part of the last inspection effort? 

VA response A8:  Yes


Vendor question 8a: If not, is it the VA s intention for the contractor to destructively penetrate/sample all flooring
 systems, even if past inspections suggest it s been addressed, to ensure that additional layers are not otherwise
 concealed? 

VA response A8a:  No

Vendor question 9: How will access be gained to all rooms, spaces, to be surveyed? Will someone with keys and full
access be assigned to be with the teams? Any delay during the site work is critical.

VA response A9:  Someone with access to all rooms will accompany the contractor.

Vendor question 10: Will contractor be allowed to sample within occupied spaces?

VA response A10:  All ACM has been identified, no sampling is needed.

Vendor question 11: May contractor extend field inspection hours, if deemed necessary and prudent, beyond listed
 normal business hours if coordinated with VA management? 

VA response A11:  No.
Vendor question 12: Are we required to replace signs and labels or will this be the first application of signs and labels?
VA response A12:  You are required to replace signs and labels where they are missing or damaged.
Vendor question 13: Locations of previous samples not indicated on drawings.
VA response A13:  Location of previous samples are not indicated on the drawings, All ACM on campus is marked in the 2013 AHERA study.
Vendor question 14: Do the site drawing indicate sample locations of previous survey? If so are they available?
VA response A14: Site drawings do not indicate sample locations of previous surveys. All ACM on campus is marked in the 2013 AHERA study.
Vendor question 15: Is it possible to coordinate a site visit with the technical representative who is in charge of the project? 
VA response A15: With a short turnaround time it is not possible to coordinate a site visit for this project.

<p>Addenda to FAR 52.212-4 are as follows:</p>
<p>1852.215-84 OMBUDSMAN. (NOV 2011)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this<br />acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source<br />of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the<br />ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or<br />the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with an ombudsman,<br />interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or<br />recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>
<p>(b) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the<br />installation ombudsman, whose name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and email<br />address may be found at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html. Concerns,<br />issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may<br />be referred to the Agency ombudsman identified at the above URL. Please do not contact the<br />ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical<br />requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer or as specified<br />elsewhere in this document.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.3 1852.223-72 SAFETY AND HEALTH (SHORT FORM). (JUL 2015)<br />(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational<br />illness; damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. NASA is<br />committed to protecting the safety and health of the public, our team members, and those<br />assets that the Nation entrusts to the Agency.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall have a documented, comprehensive and effective health and safety<br />program with a proactive process to identify, assess, and control hazards and take all<br />reasonable safety and occupational health measures consistent with standard industry practice<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c) in subcontracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold where work will be conducted completely or partly on Federally-controlled facilities.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.4 1852.225-70 EXPORT LICENSES. (FEB 2000)<br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the<br />International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120 through 130, and the Export<br />Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract. In the absence of available license exemptions/exceptions, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing foreign persons in the performance of this contract, including instances where the work is to be performed on-site at NASA Langley Research Center, where the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this clause apply to its subcontractors.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.5 1852.237-73 RELEASE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION. (JUN 2005)<br />(a) As used in this clause, "sensitive information" refers to information, not currently in the public domain, that the Contractor has developed at private expense, that may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and that may be sensitive or privileged.</p>
<p>(b) In accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies heavily on the support of various service providers. To support NASA activities and functions, these service providers, as well as their subcontractors and their individual employees, may need access to sensitive information submitted by the Contractor under this contract. By submitting this proposal or performing this contract, the Contractor agrees that NASA may release to its service providers, their subcontractors, and their individual employees, sensitive information submitted during the course of this procurement, subject to the enumerated protections mandated by the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information.</p>
<p>(c)(1) The Contractor shall identify any sensitive information submitted in support of this proposal or in performing this contract. For purposes of identifying sensitive information, the<br />Contractor may, in addition to any other notice or legend otherwise required, use a notice similar to the following:</p>
<p>Mark the title page with the following legend:</p>
<p>This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that support management activities and administrative functions. To gain access to this sensitive information, a service provider's contract must contain the clause at NFS 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. Consistent with this clause,<br />the service provider shall not duplicate, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use this information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages (insert page numbers or other identification of pages).</p>
<p>Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to restrict with the following<br />legend:</p>
<p>Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is subject to the restriction on<br />the title page of this proposal or document.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any claim that particular<br />information is "sensitive." This evaluation shall consider the time and resources necessary to<br />protect the information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the clause at<br />1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless the Contracting Officer decides,<br />with the advice of Center counsel, that reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor's<br />claim that particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and their<br />employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA in accomplishing<br />management activities and administrative functions, the service provider must be operating<br />under a contract that contains the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. This<br />clause obligates the service provider to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including the Organizational Conflicts<br />of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the contract has incorporated as a compliance document.</p>
<p>(2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession only for the purpose of<br />performing the services specified in its contract.</p>
<p>(3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from unauthorized use and<br />disclosure.</p>
<p>(4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees that need it to perform<br />services under its contract.</p>
<p>(5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to persons and entities outside of<br />the service provider's organization.</p>
<p>(6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information about their obligations to<br />utilize it only to perform the services specified in its contract and to safeguard it from<br />unauthorized use and disclosure.</p>
<p>(7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has received and will comply<br />with training on the authorized uses and mandatory protections of sensitive information needed<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply with all reasonable<br />security procedures, report any breaches to the Contracting Officer, and implement any<br />necessary corrective actions.</p>
<p>(e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for operating an information<br />technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the service provider's contract<br />shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information<br />Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause requires the service provider to<br />implement an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or<br />transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use. Service provider personnel<br />requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to these information technology systems<br />are subject to screening using the standard National Agency Check (NAC) forms appropriate to<br />the level of risk for adverse impact to NASA missions. The Contracting Officer may allow the<br />service provider to conduct its own screening, provided the service provider employs<br />substantially equivalent screening procedures.</p>
<p>(f) This clause does not affect NASA's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (g), suitably modified to<br />reflect the relationship of the parties, in all subcontracts that may require the furnishing of<br />sensitive information.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS. (JAN 2016) is applicable and the following identified clauses are incorporated by reference: 52.219-6, 52.219-28, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.223-18, 52.225-1, 52.225-13, 52.232-33, 52.232-40</p>

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment #0006 for HSTS02-16-R-OIA011 TSA Pre&radic;&reg;Application Expansion is to cancel the Request for Proposal.
<p>"Due to concerns about the ability to ensure vendors properly safeguard testing data in light of the increased and evolving cybersecurity risks over the past year, TSA, after consultation with DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate about best practices in cybersecurity for protecting data, has decided to cancel the TSA Pre&radic;&reg; Application Expansion Request for Proposal. As currently written, there is risk in using personally identifiable information during the testing phase of the process. While risk mitigations were included in the current RFP testing approach to protect the sensitive data during testing, TSA has determined it will no longer accept the risk associated with sharing the test data.</p>
<p>TSA issued the TSA Pre&radic;&reg; Application Expansion Request for Proposal (RFP) last October as part of its efforts to partner with the private sector to increase options for enrollment and expand the number of travelers enrolled in the TSA Pre&radic;&reg; program. Over the summer, TSA expanded its enrollment network to increase staff, hours of operations, and add more locations to help increase enrollments for TSA Pre&radic;&reg; as well as increase public awareness about the program. <br /><br />TSA intends to continue to improve access to TSA Pre&radic;&reg; and drive enrollment innovation by incorporating many of the enrollment enhancement requirements included in the TSA Pre&radic;&reg; expansion effort into an upcoming enrollment solicitation, to be released in the near future. This upcoming solicitation will align with DHS cybersecurity best practices and TSA's continuing focus on cybersecurity and privacy to protect people and programs.</p>

<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI)<br />Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) Out</p>
<p><br />THIS RFI IS ISSUED SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI; RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Air Force (USAF) Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Airborne Warning &amp; Control System (AWACS) Program Office. The purpose of the RFI is to determine industry availability of qualified vendors to modify four (4) Boeing E-767-based AWACS aircraft to a) integrate the "ADS-B Out" function and b) install "ADS-B Out" on the E-767 aircraft in Japan and in a classified environment. Modification timeline constraints have determined that the RFI be re-announced.</p>
<p>Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a precise satellite-based surveillance system that uses Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to determine an aircraft's location, airspeed and other data, and broadcasts that information to a network of ground stations, which relays the data to air traffic control displays and to nearby "ADS-B In" equipped aircraft. The transponder used and already installed on each aircraft is the Raytheon Company AN/APX-119, part number 4079100-0530, which includes the ADS-B capability.</p>
<p>This RFI seeks to identify qualified vendors capable of procuring an approved GPS position source for ADS-B Out, install that equipment on the four (4) aircraft, and integrate the new equipment with the transponder to provide the ADS-B Out capability for the aircraft. An ADS-B Out modification to the E-767 AWACS aircraft must meet the minimum performance requirements of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Technical Standards Order (TSO)-C166b or TSO-C154c. In addition, the vendor must be able to coordinate with the Department of Defense (DOD) Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mark XIIA System (AIMS) Certification Authority to obtain AIMS certification. Modifications to the aircraft must result in a system that meets requirements for obtaining Airworthiness Certification after the modifications are complete. It is anticipated aircraft modifications will be completed in Japan, one aircraft at a time, starting in or about 2019.</p>
<p>Reference the following performance requirements documents for the aforementioned capabilities: <br />&bull; FAA AC 20-165B: Airworthiness Approval of ADS-B Out Systems<br />&bull; RTCA DO-260B: Minimum Operational Performance Standards for ADS-B and TIS-B<br />&bull; RTCA DO-229D Change1: Minimum Operational Performance Standards for GPS/WAAS<br />&bull; TSO C145c: Airborne Navigation Sensors Using GPS Augmented by SBAS<br />&bull; TSO C166b: Extended Squitter ADS-B and TIS-B Equipment<br />&bull; DoD AIMS 03-1000B Amendment 1 (dated 1 July 2015): Technical Standard for the ATCRBS/IFF/Mark XIIA Electronic Identification System and Military Implementation of Mode S<br />&bull; DoD AIMS 03-1102B Rev 001 (dated 24 September 2014): Mark XIIA and Mode S Transponder Installation Test Requirements<br />&bull; DoD AIMS 03-1103AB: Mark XIIA and Mode S Transponder Operational Test Requirements</p>
<p>See also the list of associated documents under Quick Links at http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/programs/adsb/</p>
<p>The government requests information on sources/vendors capable of performing this E-767-based AWACS task.

<CONTACT>Brian D Serra, Phone 407-208-3357, Email brian.d.serra.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p>The Association for Enterprise Information (AFEI) is hosting an Industry Day to facilitate a knowledge sharing effort for the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE).&nbsp; The event will be held at the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, &amp; Instrumentation (PEO STRI) with participation from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)), Army Cyber Command and Second Army (ARCYBER &amp; 2A), US Cyber Command and interested Industry and Academia partners. <br /><br />When: Tuesday, November 1, 2016, 9:00am to 3:00pm <br />Where: 3039 Technology Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826, Partnership III Building, Room 321<br />Who: Interested organizations to include Industry, Government, Science and Technology, and Academia <br />Why: 1) Provide an overview of the PCTE requirement and concept of operation to support the receipt of white papers recommending technical solutions (morning session); 2) Initiate a Cyber Innovation Challenge for a specific technology supporting PCTE training (afternoon session).</p>
<p>Registration information ais available at the Association for Enterprise Information's website - http://www.afei.org/events/7A30/Pages/default.aspx.</p>
<p>1) PCTE is a training platform that allows cyber mission forces to train in emulated network environments utilizing current cyber tool suites. The PCTE supports both individual and team training, in addition to large scale exercise and experimentation via a distributed close network across multiple classifications. The evolution of the platform will largely focus on integration of available applications, enabling increased automation to ultimately support multiple simultaneous training events.

<p>Currently, the DoD uses a combination of loosely affiliated or independent virtual environments that lacks the automation necessary to establish and maintain persistent and scalable training environments.

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity.

<p>Synopses:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tennessee Army National Guard (TNARNG) located at 3041 Sidco Drive, Nashville, TN intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to award a single, firm fixed-price contract to provide all delivery supplies, plant, labor, transportation, materials, tools, equipment and supervision necessary to operate a subsistence prime vendor program for the supply and distribution of food items directly to end users within the State of Tennessee as well as nearby out of state sites. The RFP date is to be decided (TBD). The prime vendor must provide the TNARNG a customized web-based ordering program where the end user will enter the number of soldiers to be fed and program must be compatible with Windows 7 and allow the end user to submit their request through an ordering official at Directorate of Logistic Office to review and approve the order prior to the vendor shipping the order. Due to the different number of personnel in each unit, the vendor should be able to supply less than case lots when required and refrigerated shipping as needed. Nonfood items will not be included in this contract. Normally, subsistence items ordered will be mostly raw or uncooked requiring food preparation and or cooking by National Guard personnel. In addition to the monthly drills, called Inactive Duty Training (IDT) each unit normally has two weeks of Annual Training (AT) each year. Some units conduct AT in-state, while some units go out of state to places such as Ft. Chaffee, AR, Ft. Stewart, GA, Ft. Knox, KY, Ft. Campbell, KY and Camp Shelby, MS<strong>, </strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Tunnel Hill, GA</span>. The prime vendor should be prepared to support both nearby out-of-state and in-state AT delivery. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 311991. The small business standards is&nbsp;500 employees. The award will be based on a best value trade off process. Interested offerors are required to be SAM registered.</p>
