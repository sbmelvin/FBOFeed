<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, and separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, No. 915-27599 will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 01-16.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.  The NAIC Code is 332911 and the size standard is 500 employees.	NOTE: The Government will accept quotations up to $50,000 for this Request for Offer (RFO).  REQUIREMENT: The Statement of Work for this solicitation describes the development tasks needed in several critical areas for the initial stages of designing a one-gram prototype valve. The final deliverable item will be design drawings for a prototype one-gram valve. Based on availability of funding, a follow-on procurement will be initiated to manufacture and test a prototype valve based on design studies completed under this procurement. This RFQ is for materials, personnel and services to conduct development tasks needed to manufacture a one-gram microvalve. The one-gram valve shall be a miniaturized version of the Cassini/Huygens magnetic-latching microvalve with a design goal of greater than a 40% reduction in dimensions. The one-gram valve shall be designed to withstand an operating pressure of 100 bar and have a helium leak rate of less than 1x 10-10 atm.cc/sec for both the case and seat leak. The valve shall be bakeable to 300C in an open, non-operating state and shall function between -100C to +200C. The valve seat area exposed to the incoming gas stream shall be hermetically sealed from the actuator area and design considerations shall be given to minimize the dead volume in this area. Inlet and outlet ports shall have an inner diameter between 0.020 and 0.030 inches.  DEVELOPMENTMENT TASKS needed are:  1) Evaluate and select the joining method and materials for the valve's inner sleeve that will be necessary to insure a reliable valve operation. Appropriate materials, wall thicknesses and configurations suitable for the one-gram valve shall be selected, joined and tested (e.g. leak tightness, pressure tested, etc.).  Deliverables will be a completed inner sleeve assembly joined in the exact configuration suitable for the one-gram valve and a design report with test results, conclusions and recommendations. Delivery schedule shall be 2 months ARO; 2) Develop a coil-winding technique for the coil assembly suitable for the one-gram valve. Deliverables will be proof- of-design test parts and a design report with test results, conclusions and recommendations. Delivery schedule shall be 4 months ARO; 3) Develop a position - sensing device (e.g. a GMR sensor) to be used in the valve head for detecting the valve in the open or closed position. Deliverables will be a sensing device suitable for the one-gram valve and a design report with test results, conclusions and recommendations. Delivery schedule shall be 5 months ARO; 4) Design and fabricate a glass or ceramic hermetic seal for the coil feedthroughs. Deliverables will be glass or ceramic feedthrough header suitable for the one-gram valve and a design report with test results, conclusions and recommendations. Delivery schedule shall be 7 months ARO; 5) Evaluate and select a joining method (e.g. impulse welding) of the coil leads to a hollow tubes fixture simulating the hermetic seal assembly. Deliverables shall be test parts of the coil leads joined to the simulated hermetic seal assembly in a configuration suitable for the one-gram valve and a design report with test results, conclusions and recommendations. Delivery schedule shall be 8 months ARO; 6) Perform a computer study for optimizing the magnetic design of the valves' magnetic circuit. Deliverables will be a test report with computer printout showing the design simulations, recommendations, and conclusions. Delivery schedule shall be 9 months ARO; 7) Design/fabricate and/or provide proof (e.g. design used on another valve) of the concept to satisfy the helium seat leak rate of less than 1x10-10 atm.cc/sec. Delivery shall be 10 months ARO; 8) Provide drawings for a design concept of a prototype valve satisfying the requirements and specifications. Deliverables will be drawings for a design concept of a prototype valve and a design report describing the rationale for the design, engineering studies, etc. Delivery schedule shall be 12 months ARO.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The technical portion of quotations will receive paramount consideration in selecting a vendor.  However, price will also be a significant factor in the event that two or more vendors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical factors.  The technical portion of the quotations shall be evaluated based on the following technical evaluation criteria:  1) provide a short technical description explaining how the deliverables will be achieved for each of the items listed in 1 through 8, including technical feasibility of the designs, methods, processes and techniques chosen to achieve the deliverables; 2) the company's qualifications, experience, facilities and personnel to perform this work, including past work on valves having similar temperature and leak rate requirements; and 3) proposed cost to accomplish these tasks.  Item 1 is considered most important. Item 2 is considered of slightly less importance than item 1; and item 3 is considered less important than items 1 and 2 (see proposal limitation amount).  All qualified responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Offerors must provide adequate detail to allow evaluation of their offer.  Delivery shall be FOB destination.

<DESC>Precision navigation and timekeeping are essential for many modern naval and maritime systems, and it is essential that navigation and timekeeping services be made available to platforms and weapons at the highest level of accuracy and with the highest possible confidence at reasonable cost. Lack of precise navigation and timekeeping technologies may jeopardize the success of military operations. For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate position/time information at low cost and, due to this, GPS has become the technology of choice for many users. Unfortunately, the GPS signal is a low-power signal that is susceptible to interference. Therefore there is a need for both (1) affordable approaches to make GPS more reliable/robust, and (2) affordable reliable precision navigation/timing alternatives to GPS. ONR has been conducting a series of Science and Technology Projects in (1) GPS Anti-jam Technology, (2) Tightly Coupled GPS/Inertial Navigation System (INS) devices, (3) Atomic Clock Development and (4) Non-GPS Navigation Devices.

<DESC>NA Estimated draft solicitation issue date is August 5, 2002.  Estimated closing date of draft solicitation is August 20, 2002.  Estimated final solicitation issue date is September 10, 2002. Estimated final solicitation closing date is October 10, 2002.  The  U.S. Army is in the process of modernizing all Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKOs).  Each SKO consists of a wide variety of tools and equipment essential to providing support to the Army’s inventory of technologically advanced tactical and combat support weapon  systems to meet the Army’s Ordnance and Combat missions.  This process is incremental.  With the completion of each redesign, each SKO will be procured and fielded. The Army is soliciting proposals from large and small businesses to establish long-term Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contracts for various tool sets, kits and outfits (SK0s).  It is the Army’s intent to make multiple awards under this solic itation to both large and small businesses.  Individual delivery orders will be competed among all awardees unless it is determined that a specific delivery order should be competed exclusively among small business awardees.  The Army will follow the Feder al Acquisition Regulation's  “rule of two” in determining whether a specific delivery order is to be competed among small business awardees (See FAR 19.502(b)). SKO's are defined as:   	Sets:  a collection of tools/components used by a group, section, squad, platoon or unit usually supplemented by tool kits to perform an organizational mission. Unit of issue of Set (SE) 	Kits:  An assembly of tools/components in a small pouch or box designed for use and carried by an individual or crew. Unit of issue of Kit (KT) 	Outfits: An assemblage of tools or equipment.  May include separately type-classified items as a component such as: Pneumatic Tool and Compressor Outfit, Water Purification Outfit, Tool Outfit Hydraulic Systems Repair and Tool Outfit Pioneer Portable Elec tric Tools. Unit of issue of Outfit (OT). For your information, Army Tools are defined as an instrument, implement, utensil, device or machine, powered or hand operated, used in diagnosis, making operating adjustments, performing damage or fault repair and preventive maintenance of Army material. In order to promote competition this requirement has been divided into the following segments: 1. Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final u se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 2. Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final use in a  single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 3. Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be housed  in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 4. Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit i n a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components o f a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 5. Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop set are permanently mounted to its “carrier” by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Each segment will be individually competed and awarded.  The Army intends to establish two award pools for each segment: one will be created under full and open competition and the other will be for small business concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more segments.  Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical, performance risk and price proposal based on a sample SKO requirement.  The Army reserves the right to issue a delivery order on the sample SKO proposals.  The Army further reserves the right to issue an order under the award pool established under full and open competition or the award pool of small business concerns, depending upon proposals received. Small business concerns may compete for the award pool to be established under full and open competition and the pool to be established exclusively for small business concerns.  Small business concerns may submit alternative proposals based on meeting or n ot meeting the non-manufacturers rule (see 13 CFR 121.406).  Proposals based on meeting the non-manufacturers rule must be supported by adequate documentation. Offerors not receiving an award to be included in a pool of awardees will be debriefed and will have an opportunity to file a protest.   In the event that a requirement for a delivery order is competed exclusively among small businesses and only one offeror meets the nonmanufacturing rule, the contracting officer will issue the order to that offeror provided the price is fair and reasonable  and all other technical and past performance considerations are met.  The contracting officer will substantiate any determination regarding whether a price is fair and reasonable and will not consider a courtesy offer from a large business unless the cont racting officer determines that the small business offer is unreasonable.  In the event that the small business offer is unreasonable, the contracting officer may cancel the competition and compete the requirement among the full and open pool of awardees.  Finally, a small business who is otherwise eligible for award may apply for a COC if the contracting officer determines that the small business is unable to meet the nonmanufacturers rule. Interested potential offerors are invited to attend a pre-proposal conference to discuss the solicitation.  The Pre-Proposal conference will take place at The Lodge (formerly Jumers), Bettendorf, IA from 8:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 20, 2002.  This conference is open to all contractors.  The Pre-Proposal Conference will be a working luncheon.  The cost of the luncheon is $10.00 due by August 15th, 2002.  Checks will be made out to TACOM-RI Protocol and mailed to AMSTA-LC (Protocol/Laura Batchel or), TACOM-RI, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 61299-7630.  Sorry no credit card transactions.  A limited number of reduced rate rooms at The Lodge (563-355-7141) are available by referencing group reservation number 984235.  Reservations must be made NL T August 5th, 2002 to receive the reduced rate.

Description

The Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) announces its intention to award a performance-based fixed-price and award fee type contract (with issuance of individual task orders) in support of the National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS).  The NPMS website can be accessed at www.npms.rspa.dot.gov.  The purpose of this announcement is to promote interest and determine the availability of vendors that are capable of performing the activities described below in the statement of work.  This is a request for interested firms to submit a brief summary via e-mail of their capability and relevant past performance to collect and process geospatial and attribute data, metadata, and contact information from hazardous liquid and gas transmission pipeline, hazardous liquid breakout tank, and LNG facility operators in the United States. The scope of work for this requirement primarily includes (1) Review of Operator & Repository Standards (2) Documentation Procedures for Operator Data Submissions and Repository Operators (3) Processing of Pipeline, LNG and Breakout Tank Data (4) Integration of OPS Databases with the NPMS Pipeline Data (5) Onsite GIS Support (6) Internet-Based Mapping Data Distribution and Check-Plot Applications (7) Unusually Sensitive Area (USA) Model Review.  These activities support the NPMS, which is an initiative by the Office of Pipeline Safety to collect the locations and selected attributes of hazardous liquid and natural gas transmission pipelines, breakout tanks, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities.  The facilities collected are operated onshore and in DOT jurisdictional offshore territories of the United States.  The data is maintained within a geographic information system (GIS).  The NPMS was developed as a joint effort between the U.S. Department of Transportation (Research and Special Programs Administration, Office of Pipeline Safety), other Federal and state agencies, and the pipeline industry. Work will also support the Agency’s mission of ensuring the safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operation of the nation’s pipeline system.  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, codified at 49 USC 60132, requires pipeline operators to submit their hazardous liquid and national gas transmission pipeline and LNG facility data to the NPMS.  

The summary should include specialized experience and competence in managing and maintaining large relational geospatial databases in GIS, including experience in working with the full line of ESRI software including ArcGIS 8.x, ArcSDE. ArcIMS, ArcView 3.x and Oracle RDBMS; working with U.S. hazardous liquid and gas pipeline companies and their respective databases, converting digital data, digitizing paper maps, projecting data, and performing quality control processes.  

The requirements for the statement of work fall under NAICS code 541370 (Surveying and Mapping-Geospatial Mapping Services) At a minimum, each firm shall provide in its summary capabilities/experience necessary to perform the work listed in all of the above statement of work task areas.  The performance period will be for 2 base years and 3 option years for a total of 5 years.  This acquisition is a full and open competition under FAR 15 procedures.  The Request for Proposal is tentatively scheduled to be posted in FedBizOpps in November 2003.  It is anticipated that the estimated total cost of this contract will be under $5 million dollars. 

In an effort to streamline the procurement process and to utilize the Internet and electronic communications to the maximum extent possible, this pre-solicitation notice and other future related items will all be posted in FedBizOpps and on the RSPA website under Procurement Opportunities: www.rspa.dot.gov.   Responses are due by November 6, 2003. Questions pertaining to this notice may be e-mailed to the Contract Specialist, Robyn Zellars, at robyn.zellars@rspa.dot.gov.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS.

<CONTACT>PATRICIA SULLIVAN, CONTRACTING OFFICER, 781-377-3956
<DESC>Notification of Contract Action (NOCA).  This announcement constitutes a NOCA for proposed contract award to MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA).  ESC/SRK intends to award a contract to provide for the RADARSAT 2 upgrade to Eagle Vision, a deployable family of ground stations.  The added RADARSAT 2 capability will allow Eagle Vision to program the satellite, receive and archive the telemetry, and process the data into CEOS, CIB and NITF imagery.  The RADARSAT 2 capability will be able to produce imagery from synthetic aperture radar (SAR).  The upgrades will remain compatible with and be seamlessly integrated into the existing Eagle Vision systems.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 entitled "Only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency  requirements."  Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304-(c ) (1).  A Request for Information (RFI) was released to industry in March 2003.  Based on responses to this RFI, the Government considers that an award to any source other than MDA would not meet system requirements.  MDA is the sole proprietor of the license to develop, market and produce the downlink reception and processing algorithms and systems for the RADARSAT 2 satellite, and is therefore the only contractor able to perform the requested service.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the Contracting Specialist and/or Contracting Officer.  The Ombudsman's role is to hear concerns, issues and recommendations, and to communicate these to the appropriate government personnel.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired.  The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection.  ESC's Acquisition Ombudsman is Colonel Jerry T.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1.	Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.  

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records or recipients.  

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and   

(b)	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certifications.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and 

(c)	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, 

(d)	A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.

SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) though (c), above.

2.	Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term o f the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/'or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

4.	Written agreement of disposal.   For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning, or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) has a requirement to procure four hundred seventy (470) Transition Switch Modules (TSM) to replace its current Unit Level Circuit Switch (ULCS) equipment.  The Transition Switch Module (TSM) will provide commercially available circuit switching technology to replace the aging TRI-TAC family of equipment (AN/TTC-42 and SB-3865).  It will provide all of the services currently available in USMC switching equipment in a smaller, lighter package.  Additionally, the TSM will provide enhanced multiplexing capabilities and an Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) capability.  The TSM will provide a flexible Unit Level Switch capability that bridges legacy TRI-TAC switches with current commercial technology to provide Marine maneuver elements with more robust voice/data switching, data transport, and bandwidth management capabilities.  The TSM is anticipated to be a three transit case solution that will be fielded to all units that currently have a circuit switching capability (Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and Major Subordinate Command (MSC) through Regiment).

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, 'Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements,'  the Office of Naval Research (ONR) intends to enter into a contract with Electric Boat Corporation, Groton, CT.  This is not a competitive request for proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The instant procurement is in support of ONR Code 334, Ship Hull, Mechanical & Electrical Systems S&T Division.  The contract award with Electric Boat (EB) Corporation (a division of General Dynamics) will be for a period of performance for approximately five (5) years.  This requirement will be awarded on a cost plus fixed fee level of effort basis. 
This effort will support ONR's Future Naval Capabilities of Fleet and Force Protection specific to the COMSUBLANT/COMSUBPAC Command Capability Issues (CCIs) of Stealth, Survivability and Security by providing the capability to reduce boat signatures.   The effort will entail physics-based research and performance evaluations relative to naval architecture, structural engineering, signatures, hydrodynamics, marine engineering, systems and subsystems definition, boat designs and arrangements, and technology impact on cost and other technical considerations.  EB will perform assessment studies relevant to research and evaluating emerging technologies for use in future submarines.  Only EB can perform the required boat integration and impact assessments.

<DESC>Section 2812 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (FY01), Public Law 106-398, enacted into law on October 30, 2000, significantly revised 10 U.S.C. §2667, the Military Leasing Act, particularly in its treatment of in-kind consideration. The objective of this acquisition is to enter into a long-term lease, up to 40 years, under 10 U.S.C. §2667 with a private individual or entity for the out-leasing of approximately 14.5 acres at Moanalua Center for commercial development in exchange for certain in-kind consideration, primarily in the form of construction for the benefit of the Department of the Navy (DON).  The property is roughly bounded by Valkenburgh Street to the East, Bougainville Drive to the South, De Haven Street to the West and Warden Avenue to the North.  The Navy-Marine Golf Course, the Moanalua Terrace family housing area, the Navy Exchange warehouse, and the Pearl Harbor Elementary School border the property.  Currently, the property consists of mixed uses including the Navy Aloha Center (family housing office), a 65,500-square-foot shopping center and various other tenants.  The general public has convenient and open access to the site.  The property has become a primary Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) location with several tenants on existing sub-leases.  The existing Moanalua Shopping Center is among the strongest locations in the Hawaiian Islands for the QSR tenants, and the general public serves as the customer base (including civilians and military service members and their families).  Concurrently with the execution of the long-term lease, it is anticipated that the Navy and the lessee would execute an agreement specifying the manner in which the in-kind consideration will be provided by the lessee, along with any other documents necessary in connection with the project.  The DON has no authority to enter into a business partnership with the lessee.  Accordingly, DON will not share in the risk of losses arising from the lessee's commercial operations on the leased premises.  This acquisition is not governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  However, certain FAR provisions will be incorporated into the long-term lease for administrative convenience purposes or to ensure compliance with certain statutory requirements. In connection with this project, DON has initiated actions required under the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.  

This acquisition will be conducted by the Commanding Officer, Pacific Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In Step 1, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), interested parties must submit a Statement of Qualifications, in conformance with the outline contained in the solicitation, describing a Vision Statement; Organization/Team Composition; Development Qualifications, Experience and Past Performance; Operations and Management Qualifications, Experience and Past Performance; Qualifications, Experience and Past Performance of Key Project Participants; and Financial Information.  Based on its evaluation of the Step 1 submittals, the DON will invite not more than 4 offerors judged "Best Qualified", to respond to the Step 2 Request for Proposals (RFP). 

The Government intends to issue this solicitation exclusively through the Internet. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available on or about 30 October 2003 as Solicitation N62742-03-RP-00100 on the Internet at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil (free of charge).  Use N62742-03-RP00100 to access the solicitation in the search engine.  THE STATEMENT OF QUALIFICATIONS WILL BE DUE ON 12 DEC 2003 AT 2:00 PM HAWAII STANDARD TIME.

The official plan holders’ list, a list of all parties who have registered and requested a copy of the solicitation will be maintained and can be printed from the web site.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ (NAWCADLKE) intends to enter into fully competitive negotiations with qualified sources of supply. The NAWCADLKE intends to procure nine (9) Pressure Fill Tank Pre-oilers. They are to be used on the V-22 aircraft. The purpose of the pressure fill tank pre-oiler is to provide a three (3) gallon capacity pre-oiler for use in servicing aircraft engines, airframes and for filling pressure oil systems.  The pre-oiler unit consists of the following items:  a reservoir assembly, filler cap, bleeder plug, filter, pump, pressure gage, flowmeter, bleed valve, relief valve, discharge hose assembly, drain bottle assembly and an air vent.  The preoiler provides a dispensing rate of not less that one and inch nozzle.  Line pressure is produced by a hand operated pump. The oil reservoir provides storage of three (3) gallons of lubricating oil. The filler cap assembly adapter is removable and is used as an access hole for cleaning out the reservoir.  A sight glass is located on the reservoir tank to indicate the level of oil in the tank.  A bleeder plug on the bottom of the reservoir permits draining of the oil.   An oil filter is equipped with a replaceable micronic filter element and is placed in the line between the meter and the hand pump outlet.  A hand-operated piston type pump provides oil line pressure up to 100 PSI.  The oil pressure gage indicates the oil line pressure.  The oil meter is capable of metering oil in two (2) ounce increments.  The outer scale is calibrated in quarts.  A manually operated push button bleed valve is provided to relieve pressure on the meter and discharge hose and bleeds back into the reservoir.  A relief valve protects the filter and pressure gage.  A six (6) foot length of one-half (.5) inch metal clad hose is provided for discharge.  A complete drain bottle assembly is provided for the return oil from the external system being lubricated.  The pressure fill tank pre-oiler is approximately   seventeen (17) inches high, twenty-one (21) inches long, fourteen (14) inches wide and weighs approximately thirty two (32) pounds.
The contractor shall supply all labor, equipment and consumable supplies to manufacture in its entirety.  The Government does not own data rights or technical drawings.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division, China Lake, CA intends to procure on an other than full and open competition software upgrades for the Airborne Video Solid-state Recorder (AVSR) manufactured by Smiths Aerospace Inc. The AVSR is a video audio recorder driven by software known as the Operations Debrief System (ODS) also manufactured by Smiths, which provides one-screen output. Under this procurement, the contractor shall deliver a software upgrade, which provides for a second output and access to run time libraries of the Smiths’ software to provide a data file compatible with the F/A-18 Advanced Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar Data Warehouse multiple transmission needs. The contractor shall provide technical support to facilitate the integration of the ODS functionality into the AESA Data Warehouse and an ODS network multi-site license.
The proposed contract type is Firm Fixed Price. The NAICS code is 541511. This requirement is sole sourced to Smiths Aerospace Inc.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate with Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc., 8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102, for additional services on their existing contract.   HRSA's Contract Number 240-03-0007 was awarded to benefit and gather input for the National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Strategic Plan directly from the entities that would have to implement the plan.  This acquisition is for the contractor to organize, coordinate and conduct ten (10) regional meetings for awardees of the National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program (NBHPPP)underTask 25.  The purpose of these regional meetings are threefold:  (1) present and gather input on the National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Strategic Plan (NBHPSP) from the NBHPP Awardees, and regional experts; (2) facilitate discussions on regional planning 
and regional preparedness with purpose of further refining the Federal definitions of these strategic issues; and (3) provide a vehicle for exchange of information between  Federal and State, Territorial, and authorities.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc.,
is the only available source with the expertise and planning experience already tasked with assisting HRSA with fulfilling is mission to develop a national strategic plan of creating a national system for preparing the nation's hospitals against terrorism and outbreaks of infectious diseases.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. presently provides HRSA and its State, Terroritorial, and Municipal partners with the subject matter 
expertise in the field of terrorism and healthcare preparedness planning.  As a result, the contractor has been privy to information and processes that are both sensitive and comprehensive in national, and if HRSA was required to expose a new contractor to the same information, it would significantly delay the full and comprehensive formulation of a seamless strategic plan and development of the national system.   Privilege information for organizing these meetings has been developed and maintain by Booze Allen Hamilton, which no other vendor has the rights to obtain.   Any other organization that attempts to retrieve this type of privileged information would have to replicate their previous accomplishments.    This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would 
be recovered through competition, therefore, Booz Allen Hamilton, is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S. C. 253 (c), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification for Other Than Full and O pen Competition is on file.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement and accompanying statement of work constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation document will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 01-16.  This acquisition is unrestricted.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541620. A maximum  of eight  firm, fixed price purchase orders is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. The total budget for this project is not expected to exceed $200,000 for eight research papers (or $25,000 per paper) and is subject to the availability of funds.  All interested parties may  submit a proposal of no more than 25 pages.  The US EPA has a requirement for original research papers of 5,000 to 10,000 words on the topic of the relationship between socioeconomic forces and emissions of greenhouse gases and other radiatively important emissions, such as sulfur dioxide.  Proposals must encompass original research or applications of theory.  Papers that propose new theoretical frameworks that seek to refine or elaborate on the "Environmental Kuznets Curve" theory and papers that seek empirical existence of such theories are preferable.  Specific topics may include:  The role and interplay of various socioeconomic forces such GDP growth, price of energy, structure of the economy, governance structure, fuel resource availability, technological change and diffusion; The immediacy of the gas or pollutant's effect on health and environment; price shocks or other  social or economic watersheds; energy use; agriculture and land use; transportation; and the role of environmental policies such "integrated environmental strategies" in shaping alternative development pathways. The EPA has made preliminary arrangements with the Journal of Environment and  Development for the publication of the articles as a special December 2004 issue. The offeror shall select one or more topics from the above list and submit for each: 1) A research plan, including a working theory or hypothesis, or a study question relevant to the program, 2) A proposed outline of  the paper, 3) Curriculum Vitae of the author, co-author or research assistants, including publication lists; and a firm-fixed price quote for the effort including a break-down of the costs comprising the total price.    Awards will be made to the offeror(s) whose quote affords the best value to the  Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The following evaluation criteria will apply: 1) Relevance of the proposal to the project plan; 2) Strength of the research plan; 3) Experience (past performance)  of the offeror in development economics, climate change policy and  economics, environmental economics generally, and "Environmental Kuznets Curve" work.  All technical factors are considered to be of equal importance and when combined are considered more important than price.  The offeror(s) selected to receive the award of a purchase order resulting from this  solicitation must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving the award.  The CCR may be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov. The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: 52.212-1, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, 52.222-2, 52.222-21, 52.222-22,  52.222-25, 52.225-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, and 52.232-18.  The following EPAAR clauses apply to this acquisition: 1552.208-70 and 1552.209-71.  All quotes should be submitted via e-mail to Rachel Schwartz at schwartz.rachel@epa.gov or by facsimile to 202-565-2554 by close of  business January 15, 2004.  Questions regarding this acquisition should be submitted in writing to Rachel Schwartz at schwartz.rachel@epa.gov by e-mail.  Telephonic requests for information will not be honored.  This requirement will also be announced in the December issue of the Journal of  Environment and Development. Statement of Work Background and Purpose Long term analyses of climate change and long term projections of emissions such as those undertaken by the IPCC in its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) are often based on an underlying assumption of  emissions varying with factors such as income, technological change and population.  In some cases, and for some pollutants, the relationship between income and emissions is explicit.  For example, in many of the SRES scenarios is the assumption that as nations develop, their preference for air  quality improvements grows, and hence the presence of SO2 controls increases.  In other cases, and for other pollutants, the relationship may be more ambiguous and implicit only.  For example, technological progress that accompanies economic development may lead to increases in energy efficiency;  if these phenomena are coincident with increasing GDP per capita, then a gradual environmental improvement on a per capita basis may be derived from the data. One relationship between emissions and income that is often discussed in the development economics literature is the inverse U-shaped  "Environmental Kuznets Curve" (EKC).  The EKC is a graphical representation of a phenomenon behind which there is some empirical evidence ? and much theory ? that as nations develop their emissions increase up to a point beyond which emissions decline while income, or GDP, continues to grow.  There  are generally two theoretical foundations cited for the EKC phenomenon.  The first  theory is that as nations' economies transition through the developmental stages  of agrarian to industrial to service economies, their emissions naturally peak and decline.  The second theory generally hypothesized  is that as personal wealth increases, preferences for goods such as environmental quality become more evident and are eventually realized through changes in consumptive behavior and in regulatory actions.  In recent years, a number of studies have begun to question the EKC, noting, among other  things, that the empirical evidence may not exist in many cases; that the assumptions regarding the chronology and the functional form of the income-emissions relationship can have substantial effect on the shape and slope of the EKC; that different EKCs are likely to exist for different countries  and pollutants; that the direction of causality is itself not clear, and that explanatory variables other than income may be better determinants of emissions trajectories.   While EPA does not have an Agency position on the EKC theory per se, part of the purpose of this series would be to refine  the environment-development debate, specifically as it applies to long-term projections of greenhouse gases and other radiatively important emissions.  Some critiques of the EKC have found that the quadratic form is too restrictive: is there a more robust form to apply or is there no single  appropriate function.  Other critiques have found that variation across countries is critical for understanding patterns of pollution. If so, what are the key socioeconomic factors driving that variation? In short, EPA's interest does not lie a critique or defense of the EKC theory or of any EKC  construction in particular; but in obtaining a sound theoretical basis for long-term projections of radiatively important gases and aerosols. Task The contractor shall prepare a 5,000 to 10,000 paper on the general theme of socioeconomic drivers of radiatively important emissions that encompasses  original research or applications of theory.  The paper shall be prepared in accordance with the guidelines specified by the Journal Of Environment and Development.  For details please refer to: http://www2-irps.ucsd.edu/~jed/INSTRUCTIONS%20TO%20AUTHORS.htm  The contractor shall submit the  research paper to EPA for review and to the JED for formal peer review simultaneously by June 15, 2004.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:   Antonio Cueto Duthurburu, President, PERUPETRO, S.A., Ave. Luis Aldana  # 320, San Borja, Lima 41, Peru, Phone:  +51 (1) 475-9590 Ext. 250/251, Fax:  +51 (1) 475-9644 or 475-7722, Email:  bcornejo@perupetro.com.pe.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance (TA) to PERUPETRO, S.A., in the assessment of the technical, economic and financial viability of hydrocarbon exploration in the Peruvian offshore.

PERUPETRO S.A. is a state corporation, created in November 1993, responsible for the promotion of private capital investment in hydrocarbon exploration and production activities; negotiation, execution and supervision of all hydrocarbon license contracts and technical evaluation agreements; and, acts as liaison between contractors and government agencies.  

Overall, Peru has had relative success with hydrocarbon exploration and development in the past few years.  The Toledo administration has indicated that it intends to increase the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in Peru, and has discussed tax initiatives to attract development and investment, as well as additional privatization opportunities particularly in the downstream market.  As a net oil importer, a commercial oil discovery in the Peruvian offshore would counter the country’s energy imbalance, thus making a positive contribution to Peru’s long-term economic health. 

With the increase in known gas and oil reserves in Peru, the government must develop a sound strategic plan for development, particularly with regards to natural gas. While PERUPETRO has made great strides, additional assistance is needed in order to maximize Peru’s hydrocarbon potential.  Therefore, PERUPETRO, S.A. requested Technical Assistance (TA) from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)that would provide critical technology and know how for stratigraphy, a science that will ultimately provide a framework to develop hydrocarbon plays, leads, and prospects in Peru’s promising offshore waters.  In hydrocarbon exploration, a regional sequence stratigraphic framework can be used as a tool for unraveling basin-fill history and predicting the distribution of reservoirs, source rocks, and seals.  The USTDA Grant will fund a technical assessment of Peru’s offshore basins.  The project involves the evaluation of eight offshore sedimentary basins in an attempt to determine the presence of basin floor fans, channel fills and turbidites.  The majority of the TA will be conducted in the U.S.; however, PERUPETRO will authorize access to its data bank and allow the release of information needed to support project implementation.  

The Terms of Reference for the TA include the following: 

Task 1:	Technical Analysis of the Sequence Stratigraphy Interpretation
Task 2:	Economic Analysis on Prospects generated by the Technical Study
Task 3:	Financial Analysis based on the Technical and Economic Evaluation
Task 4:		Environmental Analysis
Task 5:		Regulatory Review
Task 6:		Proposed Equipment and Services
Task 7:		Implementation Plan
Task 8:	Deliverables.  Including a Final Report and Technical Briefing 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $465,500 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

IMPORTANT:  The majority of the TA will be conducted in the U.S.; however, PERUPETRO will authorize access to its data bank and allow the release of information needed to support project implementation, including all the geological and geophysical information required to develop the Project. 

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM local Lima, Peru time, November 28, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to Far 6.302-1 and U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the Johns Hopkins University (JHU), School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD for an eight month extension to the current contract with JHU for the creation and maintenance of records in the Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) (JHU Registered Trademark) database.  The OMIM database is a catalog of human genes and genetic disorders.  The purpose of this contract is to ensure the continuance of OMIM as a timely, authoritative, and comprehensive source of information on human phenotypes and genes.  The rate of discovery of new genes and the increase in experimental information pertaining to known genes requires the creation of new entries in the database and the revision of existing ones (currently over 13000 entries).  Each entry is in a standardized format containing separate fields for its unique identification number (MIM number), descriptive name, locus symbol, descriptive overview, detailed text on the phenotype(clinical features, biochemistry, pathophysiology, clinical management, modes of inheritance) and, where applicable, on the gene (e.g., mapping and cytogenetic observations, gene expression, allelic variants), animal models, historical information, a set of references, clinical synopsis, and editing audit trail.  The database also includes a human gene map with the cytogenetic location of mapped loci arranged by chromosome.  A related map (morbid anatomy of the human genome) contains the cytogenetic map locations of disease genes.  The primary source for entries is the peer-reviewed literature, supplemented by scanning genetic-related databases and consultation with recognized gene nomenclature committees and databases.  The creation and revision of entries requires expertise in the field of human and molecular genetics in addition to scientific writing skills.  Scientific judgement is required in determining whether information supports the existence of a distinct gene locus, in weighing the significance of clinical and experimental findings, and in integrating new information with previous entries.

The content of the OMIM database is based on and derived from the printed work,
Mendelian Inheritance in Man, which is copyrighted by its publisher, The Johns Hopkins University Press. Due to the rapid growth in genomic information, an eight month extension is critical to maintain a resource which describes and summarizes the most current human genetic disease information.  The staff at Johns Hopkins under the leadership of Dr. Victor McKusick have been regularly maintaining and updating the data entries since the publication of the first edition in 1966. It is currently in its 12th edition (June, 1998).  Because this compilation of human genes and the disorders and other traits with which they are associated is unique and because the rights to the data are owned by Johns Hopkins University, it has been determined that Johns Hopkins University is the only source capable of fulfilling NLM's requirement.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is an RFP available. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is establishing a new program that focuses on the rapid technology transition of revolutionary sensing capability  to support combat identification.  Based upon a government study, there appears  to be much contributing research within the Air Force, Department of Defense,  National Labs and industry that would support the development of a long-range,  unambiguous sensing capability from airborne and ground platforms.  ASC is  working with Air Combat Command (ACC) to develop operational concepts for this  envisioned capability and to plan for the potential acquisition to field this  capability.  All interested parties are invited to submit all relevant efforts  in laser sensing and multi-discriminant identification and any concepts for the  rapid development of multi-discriminant, unambiguous identification at long  ranges. Submissions should address all work/experience in the areas of laser  imaging (1D, 2D, and 3D), multipixel vibrometry, multispectral imaging,  multispectral polarimetry, multipixel moving target indication, precision  geolocation, texture mapping, change detection, and differential absorption  LADAR (DIAL).  Since atmospheric effects and target phenomenology play a large  role in the success of this capability, please include information pertaining  to work/experience in these areas as well.  Responses should address and  summarize the contractor’s research in these areas, testing of technology and  products, the level of maturity of your technology and products, and any  applications of technology to specific solutions and products. Responses will be considered an initial step in establishing industry interest  and understanding of the AMDS program and will allow the government team to  determine market understanding and capability to integrate and complete the  program. This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The Government does not intend to  award a contract on the basis of this RFI.  Submitting responses to this RFI is  voluntary, and participants will not be compensated.   Submissions should be made using a CD-R in an electronic format that is  compatible with Microsoft Windows and Office 97.  Submit two copies via  overnight mail to Maj Mark Fahrenkamp at the address set forth  above.  If the CD contains proprietary/competition sensitive information, the  CD and cover label should be marked "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive  Information."  Also, two paper copies of the response should be submitted  unbound in three-ring binders and must be clearly  labeled "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information" on the cover sheets and  in close proximity to this type of information on each applicable page.  Proprietary/competition sensitive information will be protected from  disclosure.   The paper copies and the electronic versions must be identical in all  respects.  Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches.  Pages shall be single-spaced.   The font size shall be no less than 12 point.  Use at least 1-inch margins.   For page counting purposes, double-sided pages shall be treated as two pages.   Contractor paper copy submittals shall not exceed 4 pages in length. No classified information should be included in contractor submittals.   Submissions shall be due no later 4:30 pm on 6 November 2003. Any organization or company can obtain Advanced Multi-Discriminant Sensors  (AMDS) announcements and instructions via the Web at  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.  Questions regarding the technical information  being requested in this RFI should be directed to Lt Col Richard Simpson (937)  255-5563 mailto:richard.simpson@wpafb.af.mil.  All other questions regarding  this RFI should be directed to Major Mark Fahrenkamp,(937)255-5563,  mailto:Mark.Fahrenkamp@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>This is an update to the previous notification issued for a Facility Security Survey and Risk Assessment for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.  An updated SOW and answers to questions posed by vendors will be forthcoming in a subsequent announcement.  Questions concerning the conduct of an assessment require immediate clarification.  Only the vendor selected for this effort will have access to BEP or contractor facilities; a pre-award site survey cannot be conducted due to the volume of respondees and security considerations.  Based on this, the BEP will define a level of effort for this proposal in terms of number of personnel and length of the effort required, in the amendment to the SOW which will follow this announcement.  In addition, any vendor attempting to surveill, view or otherwise monitor the BEP or its vendor facilities without the permission of the BEP or its vendor facilities will be subject to arrest and/or detention by BEP, contractor, or law enforcement security personnel.  That permission will be granted only to the firm winning this contract, and will be done only after a contract award is made.  The estimated date for release of a revised SOW and answers to vendor questions is one week from the date of this announcemenet.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization - National Capital Region (DITCO-NCR) will issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) for the acquisition of fiber to support the Global Information Grid - Bandwidth Expansion (GIG-BE) on or about 07 November 2003. The GIG-BE contract(s) will meet the current and future voice, video, data, and imagery transport needs of the Department of Defense (DOD) and its Services and Agencies. GIG-BE will supply the Warfighter with reliable and secure transmission facilities for today and tomorrow's voice, video, data, and imagery systems as required. The network will provide reliable and secure facilities to meet DOD requirements for command and control, intelligence, and support systems. This acquisition will provide for rapid expansion as required to effectively respond to the National Command Authorities, its components and select Federal agencies in peacetime, crisis situations, and wartime. The GIG-BE is being designed and sized to meet the DOD command and control voice, data, video, and imagery as requirements and mission needs dictate. A secret clearance (minimum) is required to receive, store, and generate, classified information pertaining to this acquisition. The actual planned site requirements are identified in a classified Annex to the Statement of Work. The National Industrial Security Program (NISP) and the 1995 NISP Operating Manual (NISPOM) incorporating change one, dated 1997, and change two, dated 2001 prescribes requirements, restrictions, and other safeguards that are necessary to prevent unauthorized disclosure of classified information and to control authorized disclosure of classified information released by U.S. Government Executive Branch Departments and Agencies to their contractors. The Manual also prescribes requirements, restrictions, and other safeguards that are necessary to protect special classes of classified information, including Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, intelligence sources and methods information, Sensitive Compartmented Information, and Special Access Program information. These procedures are applicable to licensees, grantees, and certificate holders to the extent legally and practically possible within the constraints of applicable law and the Code of Federal Regulations. Commercial entities that are in receipt of this government solicitation and wish to submit a competitive proposal to the government can obtain the associated classified information by providing a statement of compliance with the terms and conditions of the 1995 NISPOM with changes and the following terms of reference: Company Name: Address: Zip Code: CAGE Code: Defense Security Service (DSS) Cognizant Office (DCO). Company's Facility Security Clearance(s) (FLC). FCL Level of Clearance, Storage Level of Clearance, and any special consideration. Facility Security Officer (FSO) Name: Phone Number: Classified Mailing Address. It is the government's intent and desire for all companies to pick up the classified documentation vice having it mailed. Those companies providing their security information IAW the above terms of reference shall provide it via email to Mr. Gary L. Akin, at aking@ncr.disa.mil and Mr. Charles Fletcher, at fletchec@ncr.disa.mil no later than four working days prior to picking up the classified information. Mr. Akin and/or Mr. Fletcher will make arrangements and schedule a date and place for pick up upon receipt of the company's security information and the company’s “statement of compliance” with the NISPOM. Individual(s) picking up the classified information must present a proper courier card/letter issued by the DCO and photo identification for proof of identity. A company that is foreign owned and cleared under a Special Security Arrangement (SSA) and its cleared employees may only be afforded access to “proscribed information” with special authorization.  This special authorization must be manifested by a favorable national interest determination (NID) that must be program/project/contract-specific, thus a company operating under a current SSA doesn’t automatically afford them access to GIG-BE program information.  Access to proscribed information is predicated on compelling evidence that release of such information to a company cleared under the SSA arrangement advances the national security interest of the United States.  The Government anticipates a fixed price contract.  A single or multiple contracts may be awarded if it is in the Government's best interests. The unclassified RFP will be posted on or about 07 November 2003 on the World Wide Web at http://www.ditco.disa.mil under Contracting Opportunities on the DITCO Home Page. All inquiries regarding the GIG-BE RFP shall be submitted electronically and directed to Mr. Arthur S. Block, Contracting Officer, at blocka@ncr.disa.mil. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 517110 will be used for determining company size status.

Solicitation No. GS05P04GBC0006

Solicitation for Construction Services to retrofit the HVAC system for the prisoner holding and transfer areas at the U.S. Courthouse, 5400 Federal Plaza, Hammond, Indiana, to ensure that the airborne pathogens are not allowed to infiltrate the air systems serving the rest of the courthouse.  The existing system will be modified to provide a closed HVAC system for the prisoner areas that utilizes 100% outside air for supply, conditions and circulates the air within the space and exhausts all of it to the outside through HEPA filters.  At the transfer corridor on the lower level and holding areas on the second, third, and fourth levels, ductwork will be reworked and existing VAV boxes or air handling units will provide supply air.  Reworked duct, together with new exhaust fans with HEPA filters, will exhaust the air.  Existing mechanical, electrical and plumbing elements will be relocated, if required, to install the new ductwork.  
The work will be performed largely off hours and coordinated to minimize the impact on the prisoner holding and transfer associated with the courthouse operation.  Funds are not currently available for this acquisition.  A firm, fixed-price contract is contemplated.  Contractor selection will be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for Source Selection procedures and the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Proposal process.  Offerors will submit price proposals and technical proposals in separate envelopes.  The technical proposals will be reviewed first for compliance with the Go/No-Go factors based on experience with similar projects, acceptable references and company/key personnel qualifications.  Only the price proposals from offerors that meet these technical requirements will be opened and evaluated.  
The intention is to make award to the LPTA, responsible offeror.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations if it is determined to be in its best interest to do so.  This procurement for Building Alterations falls under NAICS code 236220.
It is open to both large and small businesses.  The small business size standard for this work category is $28.5 million.  “Although this procurement is open to large businesses,” small, small woman-owned, small minority-owned, small HUBZone, small Veteran-Owned, and service disabled Veteran-Owned firms are strongly encouraged to participate.  Large business will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, small woman-owned.  
HUBZone small, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and Veteran-Owned Small business

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: Potential Sources Sought. This is not an RFP.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources who can: (1) deliver a localized roughness software (“bump finder”) with a fully user customizable analysis option that allows incorporation into ProVAL, an engineering software application that allows users to analyze longitudinal profiles obtained from inertial profilers; (2) demonstrate the bump finder to FHWA and designated state agencies, indicating the benefits and potential pitfalls of the software method; (3) provide implementation guidelines with basic specification language that an agency could use/modify the bump finder for its own Ride Quality smoothness specifications where “bump finding” is required; (4) train representatives from FHWA and designated state agencies, complete with “transportable” training package, in the use and application of the bump finder; (5) draft a field users guide, which will provide instructions for field engineers and contractors who will interpret the output of the bump finder; and (6) provide any modifications to the field users guide that are recommended by the pooled fund participants.  The government has identified the following technical requirements, which state the bump finder should contain an algorithm that: (1) provides a means of locating and quantifying undesirable roughness on a roadway; (2) indicates to a contractor/agency/owner what rough features cost, expressed in terms of contribution to the roughness of the pavement and in dollars of lost incentive pay; (3) suggests a strategy for corrective action when a bumps or dips are found using a profilograph, which would include an assessment of the contribution of the bump/dip to the overall roughness, the expected outcome of grinding, the optimal corrective strategy for eliminating roughness caused by a bump/dip, and the length and depth of the grind. Overall, the bump finder is expected to set forth criterion for identifying localized roughness and prioritize the use of a grinder (a should-grind locator).  The estimated period of performance for the project is nine months.  The FHWA is seeking information on existing localized roughness software.  Any interested firms should submit user references, as well as sufficient information which will permit evaluation of technical product and capabilities in writing to Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management (HAAM) (Attn: Ms. Rachel Mirchandani, HAAM 20-C), Room 4410, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington DC 20590. For questions concerning this announcement contact Ms. Mirchandani at 202-366-9054. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract nor does the government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this solicitation. See note 25 for specific information, to be submitted in response to this synopsis.

<DESC>The Vaccine Clinical Research Branch (VCRB), Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), intends to negotiate, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302-1, a modification to increase the volume of activity under its seven (7) year contract N01- AI-85341 with BBI Biotech Research Laboratories. This contract was awarded under full-and-open competition under SIC Code 8733; Size Standard $5 million, for the period July 1, 1998 through June 30, 2005. The project currently provides support to all DAIDS vaccine and prevention clinical trials. This contract was originally designed to collect and store clinical specimens and perform virological, immunological, and molecular biological assays to detect HIV infection as well as measure immune responses in support of the DAIDS vaccine and prevention clinical trial networks. The contract requires expansion to support the growing HIV vaccine pipeline that extends beyond the current HIV vaccine trial network (HVTN) central laboratory capabilities. The planned negotiated modification will expand current tasks and provide for a level of increased effort over a period of two years (within contract’s current period). BBI is in a unique position to perform the work  because of its previous experience and continuous support to HVTN laboratories during the preceding five years in the following areas:
1. HIV-1 serum validation assays for ELISA and Western blot analysis
2. Developed an ELISA for IgA and IgM antibodies for comparison to Western blot analysis 
3. Validated a cell line based neutralization assay and validation of HIV isolation and culture procedures
4. Developed and standardized ELISPOT protocols utilizing CMV, EBV and Influenza (CEF) standard peptides against cells from uninfected HIV negative volunteers 
5. Evaluated cell recovery, viability, and apoptosis of PBMC after cryo preservation and long term storage 

To support DAIDS sponsored vaccine trials, BBI will: 1) process, store and ship sera/PBMCs to HVTN central immunology laboratories; 2) periodically perform tests to assess the viability of patient’s PBMCs; 3) serve as central repository for ELISPOT proficiency test panels; 4) acquire, assemble and ship reagents for ELISPOT proficiency panels to participating sites; 5) manufacture and provide standardized ELISPOT kits to central immunology laboratories;  6) validate and provide SOP for sample freezing and shipping, especially as related to international sites without liquid N2 capabilities; 7) develop capacity to audit and train laboratories performing immunological assays.

If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must submit a capability statement within 45 days from the posting date of this announcement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort. See Government wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<RESPDATE>112403
<CONTACT>Mary Helen Moore at 850-235-5058, or Contracting Officer Carol Dreger at 850-234-4863.
<DESC>GOVERNMENT SOURCES SOUGHT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for Diver Hull Navigation System with Component Integration of Navigation, Sensor, Communication and Display Subsystems. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NSWC Panama City on behalf of the Program Executive Office Littoral and Mine Warfare (PEO-LMW) Program Management Office Explosive Ordnance Disposal (PMS-EOD) is seeking information on diver based hull search or navigation systems and component technologies for use when conducting Explosive Ordnance Disposal diving operations, including searching and inspections of ships hulls and berthing areas.  This notice serves as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting research efforts.  NSWC PC and PMS-EOD are interested in systems and technologies that will support diver navigation and search capabilities.  Ultimately, this will support this mission by providin g capabilities in the following areas: 1)Record of where the diver has searched, ensuring there are no ‘holidays’ in the search area.  2)Means of recording a mark for the location of an item of interest 3)Interoperability with a ship hull database 4)Diver display of marks to enable reacquisition 5)Record of the ship frame number corresponding to a marked location. 6)Ability to record multiple types of marks 7)Identification of ship features. 8)Real-time communication (topside-to-diver, diver-to-topside, diver-to-diver) of navigation or location information and imaging data. 9)Man portable in a small boat operating environment 10)Navigation and detection systems integrated with a diver display 11)Detection and navigation in low visibility environments 12)Detection capability of objects of interest.  Ideally display resolution would enable detection of objects as sm all as 2 inch x 2 inch x 1 inch at distances up to 50 ft. 13)Swimmability such that (a) in water components allow diver to conduct mission unencumbered by the system, (b) use of the system does not cause diver fatigue (c) system maximizes the ability to free the divers hands to perform other mission tasks. 14)Power source replaceable or rechargeable at the operational level. 15)Efficient navigation and search capabilities such that mission time is minimized. 16)Navigation and sensor data update rates sufficient for effective conduct of diver tasks and topside monitoring and response. 17)Data storage of all mission generated navigation and sensor data.  The system must be lightweight and man portable.  Any component of the system that is not diver borne shall have a small shipboard footprint and able to provide top-side operations from a small inflatable craft.  Open sys tem architecture to allow for future upgrades is a desirable feature.   This RFI addresses three major areas: 1)Navigation, sensor, and communication systems that can be integrated with a standard display to support user operational evaluations for the development of the diver hull mission concept and requirements. 2)Displays suitable to the mission operational environment, which could receive input from navigation and sensor systems and present information to the divers. 3)Systems integration concepts to support both near and far term diver hull mission capabilities. (i.e. Information Exchange protocols between Diver Search and Navigation Systems, Remotely Operated Vehicles and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles Navigation Systems.) Interested parties must provide paper submittals, to be received by the Government by 1630 hours on 24 November 2003.  The Government will asses s submittals for their potential use in the diver hull navigation mission.  Contractors’ submittals that the Government determines to possess potential for contributing to the diver hull search and navigation mission solution may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate their system or subsystem.  Contractors must identify for which of the three areas listed above their submission is to be considered.  The assessment criteria are based on system technical maturity, potential effectiveness, performance, suitability, cost, and schedule. The Navy is contemplating convening a limited-scope demonstration event in the May through July time frame and anticipates inviting selected Contractors to demonstrate their system capabilities.  For the purposes of the demonstration, the focus will be on verifying system ability to satisfy the assessment criteria while operating in a relevant  operational environment.  The government does not anticipate providing funds to Contractors to participate in the demonstrations. There is no specific format or outline that submittals must follow.  However, information pertinent to the assessment criteria, especially system or subsystem technical maturity, should be provided.  Include other descriptive literature and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  Contractors responding should indicate whether they are a small business (S), a small disadvantaged business (SDB), 8(a), or large business (L).  Please include four (4) copies of each response.  Each response must reference the RFI title and must be limited in length to ten (10) typed pages.  Specific narrative information that should be provided in the submission include: (1)System d escription, capabilities (2)Chronology of system development (3)Summary of past test events with location, dates and results (4)If available, logistic supportability and projected unit cost estimate information.  (5)In anticipation of Contractor invitation for the limited scope demonstration, provide an explanation of what would be demonstrated and any additional support required of the government necessary for the Contractors participation in the demonstration. Supporting literature and test documentation that demonstrate technical maturity of your proposed solution may be included in addition to the 10-page narrative paper.  Contractors offered an opportunity to demonstrate their system will be provided additional details including demonstration schedule and extent of support the Government will provide.  Telephone responses will not be honored. Technical Questions con cerning this announcement should be directed to Ms. Jody Wood-Putnam, e-mail  Wood-PutnamJL@ncsc.navy.mil

<DESC>PEOSTRI is continuing to refine our approach for the acquisition of the Active Dynamic Spectral Projector (ADSP), which is part of the Contamination Avoidance Detector Test Suite (CADTS) Program.  The ADSP system will (1) synthetically simulate the spectral signature of chemical/biological agents and simulants (with and without interferents), and then (2) dynamically stimulate the detector system under test (SUT).   This system will be used in support of efforts to evaluate emerging Department of Defense (DoD) standoff detector systems, and the calibration and validation of range test equipment such as Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) systems. Draft versions of the System Requirements Document (SRD) and the Statement of Work (SOW) for the ADSP may be found at http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=stricom&men=OPA.   Once you access this URL, please go to the pull down bar under  “Document Types”, select “All”, then click on Active Dynamic Spectral Projector.  

At this time, PEOSTRI is conducting market research to determine interested parties and to solicit any feedback/comments on the draft documents.  Additionally, interested parties are requested to (1) identify potential technologies necessary to satisfy the requirements identified in the documents, (2) provide suggested teaming arrangements, (3) provide suggested contract type, and (4) provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the effort. 

PEOSTRI intends to use the information provided for planning purposes only, to include the decision to use the STOC ID/IQ or such other strategy as appropriate.

<SUBJECT>99 -- 2003 Core Technologies for Space Systems Conference 4-6 Nov 2003
<DESC>Headquarters Air Force Space Command funded the Operationally Responsive Spacelift (ORS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for FY03. The ORS AoA began preliminary study activities in fall of 2002.  Preliminary results solidified the need to kick-off the ORS AoA in Mar 2003 with a planned completion date by Mar 2004.  Numerous organizations are supporting the ORS AoA effort.  AFSPC/DR is the lead, with help from AFSPC/XO/XP/IN, SMC, SAWC/SB, ASC, AFRL, NASA, and USSTRATCOM, among others.  The ORS effort plans to conduct an AoA in a shorter time span and with less cost than traditional AoAs by establishing the military utility of the concept at the beginning and then analyzing the concept solutions from there.

The ORS AoA effort will examine and develop requirements to provide responsive spacelift support to the warfighter.  Operationally Responsive Spacelift is a transformational concept to launch, maneuver, service, and retrieve space payloads to enhance military effectiveness.  ORS will, for the first time, give the Joint Force Commander (JFC) tactically responsive space capabilities to support Area of Responsibility (AOR) effects-based operations.  The ultimate goal is to lift and deploy responsive payloads meeting the JFC needs.  This requires lift sortie turn times similar to aircraft and payloads that are ready for operational use within hours or a few days after reaching orbit.  ORS supports all space mission areas: Force Application, Force Enhancement, Space Support, and Counterspace.

NASA and AFSPC are collaborating on the ORS AoA and identifying processes, technology and/or subsystems that are applicable to both the military force application and civil space flight programs.  

Colonel Pam Stewart, the ORS AoA Study Director, will brief the interim update of the AoA.  It is currently schedule to be briefed on Monday, 4 Nov from 1005 to 1055.  POC: Ms Linda Jewell (719)554-2542 - email linda.jewell@peterson.af.mil

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
    (1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

    (2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: FORCE PROTECTION.

Charterer reserves the right, at Charterer’s sole option, to embark armed US Armed Forces members.  These armed forces personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by US Military Authorities, and will operate under the command of competent US Military Authorities.  Charterer agrees reimburse the Owner of cost of such additional personnel at the rate set forth in the Charter for Supercargoes.

·	The lifting/transport cradle is suitable for one or two point lift.

·	Position reports: mschq-cargo@navy.mil and other addresses, to be provided separately

   ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.

    (1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

    (2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: VOYAGE CHARTER FORCE PROTECTION. 

    (1) Owner agrees that U.S. Armed Forces personnel may board the Vessel at any time at any location for U.S. national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such U.S. Armed Forces personnel on the boarding party.

    (2) Owner agrees to render all necessary assistance to such United States Armed Forces boarding party with respect to the identification of crew members or such others as may be aboard the Vessel, and to permit the United States Armed Forces personnel to search without limitation any and all vessel spaces for U.S. national security purposes.

    (3) Owner consents to the immediate removal of crewmembers or such others as may be aboard the Vessel deemed unsuitable for any reason by the Contracting Officer, or U.S. Armed Forces personnel.  Owner agrees to replace any such crewmembers promptly so as not to delay prosecution of the voyage, and that such replacements will fully comply with all crew screening requirements.  Charterer agrees to bear reasonable costs incurred by the Owner associated with replacement, if necessary.

    (4) Owner understands and agrees that equipment belonging to the Armed Forces of the United States of America will be embarked aboard the vessel during the period of the Charter.  Charterer reserves the right, at Charterer’s sole option, to embark additional armed U.S. Armed Forces members, for the purposes of protection of the equipment belonging to the U.S. Armed Forces.  These armed forces protection personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by U.S. Military Authorities, and will operate under the command of competent U.S. Military Authorities. Charterer agrees to reimburse the Owner of cost of such additional personnel at the rate set forth in the Charter for Supercargoes.  

ADD: CREW LIST.  Offerors must provide a certified crew list no later than 96 hours  prior to delivery of the vessel at the designated load port (or first designated loading port in the case of multiple load ports).

The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters “NMN” if no middle name), date of birth, place of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the vessel. The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Excel).  

ADD: DEMURRAGE/DETENTION DOCUMENTS.  In the event of demurrage/detention, all supporting documents as identified in the invoicing clause shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to submission of demurrage/detention invoices.  After receiving Contracting Officer's concurrence, owner may submit demurrage/detention invoices to the office identified in Box 18B of SF 1449.

ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.  The MSCHQ Command Center should be contacted if the Area Command cannot be reached.  Contact numbers will be provided upon award.

MODIFY: III(i) - notwithstanding the requirement for utmost dispatch in subparagraph (1), vessel is to arrive at discharge port no later than 11 February, 2004.

MODIFY: III (n) - add new sentence at the end of subparagraph (1): “The United States of America shall be named as an additional Assured Party with waiver of subrogation on all applicable insurance policies.”

MODIFY: IV(i) – add new subparagraph: “(5) Owner must immediately notify Charterer of any changes in the Vessel’s commercial war risk insurance, including but not limited to, extensions of war risk exclusion zones and increases in commercial war risk insurance premiums.
