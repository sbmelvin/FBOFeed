<a href="mailto:travis.james3@us.army.mil">Travis James</a>
<DESC><br/>Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS)<br/><br/>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Picatinny, on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for manufacturing the XM153, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS), recapitalization of the previously delivered XM153 CROWS, engineering and logistics services, and spares parts. <br/><br/>The CROWS is a multivehicle externally mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing a variety of crew served weapons.  The CROWS provides remote day and night sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move. The major CROWS sub-assemblies include: Fire Control Unit, Control Grip, Main Frame Assy, Right Side Support Assy, Left Side Support Assy, Servo Sight Assy, Thermal Imaging Module, Visual Imaging Module, Soft Mount, Cocking Actuator, Laser Range Finder, Ammo Box Assy, Weapon Adaption Kits, Cables, and Cover.  This list is not intended to be all inclusive.  <br/><br/>The Government has determined that a Full and Open Competition Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract will be utilized for the CROWS requirement.  The expected contract duration is five (5) years. Orders will be issued against the IDIQ contract(s) under three (3) separate and distinct areas of its Statement of Work (SOW).  Each area will have a different contract type associated with it.  The three (3) areas of the SOW and the three (3) planned contract types associated with each one for this requirement are as follows:<br/><br/>I. Fixed-Price, IDIQ: To support production of a maximum of 18,000 CROWS, field maintenance support, and spares.  The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 300 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 500 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Fixed-Price Incentive, IDIQ:  To support product improvements, integrations, and testing.  Share line will be 50/50 with 120 percent ceiling as a point of departure. <br/><br/>III. Firm-Fixed-Price Level-of-Effort, IDIQ:  To support training, overhaul, depot-level maintenance and recapitalization of CROWS; and for general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification will consist of performance requirements and will specify technical drawings.  The detail specification will specify the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and/or how the items are to be fabricated or constructed.  Some sub-assemblies will not include technical drawings and assembly procedures.  Instead, data for those sub-assemblies will include directed source(s) or build-to-spec requirements or both. This approach will ensure a very high level of commonality between multiple CROWS producers and commonality/interchangeability with the existing CROWS fleet.  The Government will provide the aforementioned data on a Digital Video Disc (DVD).  Most data will be in a Portable Data Format (pdf) format but some data may be provided in other formats. <br/><br/>Below is a list of items that are planned to be provided as part of the formal solicitation but will not be included in the draft solicitation release:<br/><br/>Detail Specification<br/>   -     Performance requirements<br/>   -     Technical Drawings<br/>   -     Specifications and Interface Control Documents for those components for which detailed technical drawings are not provided.<br/>   -     Solid models for castings including machining drawings<br/>   -     Gerber formatted printed circuit board layouts with pick and place data<br/>   -     Assembly procedures<br/>   -     List of approved sources for sub-assemblies at various levels of production build <br/>   -     Quality requirements <br/>   -     Test requirements<br/>   -     Executable software files<br/><br/>The software code and associated documentation will not be provided at any time nor will Contractors have access to the data. Only the executable software files will be provided. The software code will be managed by the US Government. Any software changes required in the execution of the contract will be handled utilizing a software change process between the US Government and Contractor(s). <br/><br/>The design/production data described above will be available after Request for Proposal release upon request provided that all necessary paper work is properly completed by the requester, submitted, and approved prior to any release.  <br/><br/>For U.S. & Canadian Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (U.S. & Canada) must complete and submit a DD2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire, and Non-Disclosure Agreement which will be provided. The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced. <br/><br/>For Other Foreign Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (Other Foreign) must complete and submit a AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire and a Non-Disclosure Agreement which will be provided and also be compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced.  <br/><br/>This announcement serves as notification that export control procedures regulated by the ITAR are in effect on the above stated data. Contractors that are interested in receiving this data must be in compliance with the ITAR and possess the proper authorities to receive this data and are encouraged to do so as soon as possible.  The data will be marked Distribution Statement  B  Distribution authorized to U.S. Government agencies only.   All other requests for this data shall be referred to Project Manager Soldier Weapons.

The Contractors responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided above.<br/><br/>After contract award, the contractors will be provided Government-Furnished Materiel (GFM) to help validate interfaces and qualify suppliers. The GFM may include full up XM153 CROWS systems, select parts and weapons. Contractors must make the appropriate accommodations to be approved for handling and storage of weapons. Government support may be provided to assist in understanding the setup and use of the XM153 CROWS and its operation following contract award. <br/><br/>The present schedule projects a release of a draft solicitation on or about 3QFY11.  An Industry Day will be announced during the draft solicitation release and further details shall be posted on FedBizOpps.gov (https://www.fbo.gov/).

<DESC>The U.S. Research, Development and Engineering  Command (RDECOM) is providing notice that a Request for Proposal (RFP), W911QY-11-R-0013, for the Advanced Development of a Trivalent Filovirus vaccine will be issued on or about 16 March 2011 with an anticipated contract award on or about 30 June 2011.  This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  <BR><BR>Small business prime contractors are required to comply with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting and 13 CFR 125.6 (known as the 50% rule).  Rules on affiliation and joint ventures are at FAR 19.101, 13 CFR 121.103, 13 CFR 124.513 and 13 CFR 125.6.  Under the 50% rule where the preponderance of support is for supplies (other than procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies), the concern shall perform work for at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials.  The small business prime contractor must meet this requirement (1) individually, or (2) together with other small business members of a formal joint venture, or (3) together with a small number of small business subcontractors forming an informal joint venture, in which those subcontractors meet the definition of ostensible subcontractor as set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(4). Team members in such formal and informal joint ventures are exempt from affiliation rules under the conditions set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3).  There is no limit to the number of other team subcontractors or size status of subcontractors. <BR><BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all interested contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  CCR registration can be accomplished at the following website:  http://www.ccr.gov. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, with a size standard of 500 employees. The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.  <BR>The objective of this procurement is to deliver, after limited advance development, a current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) trivalent filovirus vaccine using the Government Licensed Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) Replicon Particle (VRP) system that will be suitable/acceptable for use in humans by the Government to support non-clinical and Phase 1 studies under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The manufacturer shall develop, abide by and document cGMP and processes consistent with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Q7 guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, FDA regulation 21 CFR Part 211-cGMP for Finished Pharmaceuticals, and 21 CFR Part 600.<BR><BR>The Contractor shall conduct formulation studies to support the development of a trivalent vaccine as well as analytical assay development, including in-process and release assays of cGMP bulk(s) and final product, and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)-compliant stability testing.  The small scale manufacturing process developed must be scalable and transferrable to another facility, if necessary.  <BR><BR>The viral glycoprotein genes from each strain shall be cloned into a cGMP compliant optimized VEE replicon vector.  The replicon technology is derived from an attenuated strain of the VEE virus, V3014. Specific pathogen genes of interest are inserted as replacements for VEE virus structural genes, thereby making the particle replication defective.  Note: The initial manufacturing efforts must be conducted at BioSafety Level (BSL) 3.  Downstream processing can occur at BSL-2 following negative testing results for live virus. Through market research, the government has identified BSL-3 facilities available for leasing.  Interested parties may submit a request for the list by email to  cbmsfilorfp@amedd.army.mil prior to March 16, 2011.  The list is not intended to be all-inclusive, and interested parties are welcome to conduct their own market research to identify BSL-3 facilities.<BR>Proposals will be evaluated based on Factors, Subfactors, and Elements representing the "Best Value" to the Government.  Delivery schedules of the vaccine product shall be proposed by the offerors and will be used as one of the criteria associated with a Best Value evaluation. Proposed schedule calling for delivery of the Trivalent Filovirus Vaccine, as described above, is anticipated within 3 to 4 years after contract award, but all proposed delivery schedules will be evaluated.  All interested parties can view, download, and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments when released on or about 16 March 2011 at the FedBizOpps website hyperlink https://www.fbo.gov/.  Search on solicitation number W911QY-11-R-0013.  No paper copies of the RFP will be provided and no mailing list will be maintained because the acquisition will be posted on the above website.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which DLA Distribution, New Cumberland, PA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for repair of two (2) Grove 40 Ton Mobile Cranes (Model RT875 and Model TMS500E-2) located at DLA Distribution Tobyhanna, PA.
<p>Stephenson Equipment, Inc. is the only source that can repair these cranes because they are the Grove factory-authorized distributor for the Tobyhanna, PA area. In order to ensure that the performance, reliability and safety of these cranes are not compromised, the contractor that performs this repair must be a Grove authorized distributor that employs factory trained service technicians who are technically familiar with the Grove cranes, and have unlimited access to obtain OEM replacement parts. Grove has established this authorized distributor network to ensure replacement part compatibility and repair service integrity because the use of non-OEM replacement parts and non-OEM factory trained service technicians could be catastrophic in terms of equipment liability costs and personnel injury or death. Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order (FFP) utilizing FAR Part 13 to Stephenson Equipment, Inc. to repair the Grove 40 Ton Mobile Cranes.</p>
<p>Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The delivery date will be 30 days after receipt of the order.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 811310 with a small business size standard of $7,000,000.00.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to repair two (2) Grove 40 Ton Mobile Cranes (Model RT875 and Model TMS500E-2) by 4:00 PM EST, THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2011 to Daniel Herring, Acquisition Operations, J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone: 717-770-6030, FAX: 717-770-5689, or e-mail: daniel.herring@dla.mil for consideration by the agency. If no affirmative responses are received by 4:00 PM EST, THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2011 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated and awarded to Stephenson Equipment, Inc.</p>

<a href="mailto:vickie.gordon@faa.gov">vickie.gordon@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issues this market survey seeking industry sources to acquire a portable Doppler Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (DVOR) system inclusive of equipment shelter and counterpoise.  The FAA expects to release a Screening Information Request (SIR) during the 3rd quarter of FY2011. A product operational capabilities test is required as part of the selection process.  Contract award is expected in FY 2011.
The new procurement is needed to satisfy an unfilled national airspace systems (NAS) requirement.  The purpose of this market survey is to gain awareness of industry capabilities and determine what commercial products already exist that meet or exceed DVOR requirements contained in the attached Draft Performance Specification Doppler Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (DVOR) paragraphs 4 and all of 5.1.  
PORTABILITY:  The DVOR system must be transportable via ground only.  It must meet commercial transportation height/width/length requirements allowing transportation over established roadways within the contiguous 48 states. No National Airspace System operational requirements have or will be changed and no research and development is envisioned for this procurement.  Informal industry discussions indicate that multiple sources of commercial products may be available that meet or exceed these new requirements.
Interested industry sources must submit responses that demonstrate their DVOR system satisfies the requirements above and the Draft DVOR performance specification or how any differences would be resolved.  Integrator/Team responses are welcome.  Three copies are requested.  The following information is requested: 
1.  Technical data, as appropriate, to demonstrate that available commercial products meet or exceed the identified portions of the Draft DVOR performance specification.  Include data relative to the capability of adding a DME, sparing, training, maintenance, and engineering support services; fifteen (15) page limit.
2.  Data to show that the system will conform to the portability requirements specified in the above paragraph; five (5) page limit
3.  Vendor corporate history, relevant contract experience that demonstrate ability to produce DVOR products and demonstrate ability to deploy these DVOR products; five (5) page limit.
For the above criteria, all experience indicated must include relevant experience over the last three years, including a brief description of the work performed, the contract number, the identification of the Government or commercial agency for which the work was performed (identify all efforts performed as a subcontractor); and the name, title and telephone number of the Contracting Officer.
Responses containing only company brochures, catalogs or other generic type information will be considered nonresponsive. For market survey purposes only, interested industry sources must submit 1) their pricing for products that meet or exceed the DVOR specification and 2) their company's Business Size Standard and Socio-Economic Status.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334511, Doppler VOR, Aeronautical, manufacturing.
All submissions received by the FAA will be treated as Proprietary Information unless otherwise requested by the individual submitter. Inquiries and responses received within thirty (30) days after the publication date of this notice will be considered.  Inquiries and responses must be submitted not later than Friday, March 18, 2011, 12:00, Noon, Eastern Standard Time (EST).
The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals at this time.  They are not desired and will not be accepted.  This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this request for information/market survey, nor will reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding.  Electronic, telephonic and telegraphic responses will not be accepted.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirements to competition based upon response to this is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Respondents will not necessarily be notified of the results of the evaluation. 
Responses to this notice must be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Attn: Vickie Gordon, Federal Aviation Administration, AJA-47, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC. 20591.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Exploration Technology& Demonstrations (ETDD) radio development non-commercial effort to provide a wirelessnetwork communications platform to target future International Space Station detailedtest objectives. For FY 2011, the EVA ETDD radio effort will conduct a stand-alonetechnology demonstration of a bimodal EVA radio that utilizes 802.11n (Wideband) and aCOTS waveform (UHF, Operational Band). One of the Level 1 requirements for the EVA ETDDradio platform is to integrate a Delay/ Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN)-enabledmiddleware solution that will support DTN-enabled applications, facilitate switching, andoperate as an intelligent data buffer between Operational and Wideband radio operations.This activity will last the duration of eight (8) months. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from the University of Colorado, 3100 Marine St,Boulder, CO. NASA has previously used BioNet, a DTN-enabled middleware solution developed by BioServe,which was leveraged for NASA experiments. To attempt to find another firm for this workwould add significantly to the total cost of the project and would delay the planneddeliverables. The labor-hours to develop an eventual in-house capability and integrateother Delay/ Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) builds onto the EVA ETDD radioarchitecture exceed the costs of purchasing and integrating BioNet.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon February 28, 2011. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.   The installation Ombudsman is KirkSeablom. He can be reached via email at kirk.d.seablom@nasa.gov.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the following:01 Qty: 1, Description: Cs4000 24V DC input Oscillator, with internal battery, 2yr.electronics, and 12 yr. tube warranty.NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Symmetricom, Inc.pursuant to FAR 13.106 forthe acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from onlyone source.   The Formation flying Testbed (FFTB) requires a reference oscillator capableof providing an accuracy of no greater than 1E-12, Allan Deviation stability less than orequal to 102E-11, stability floor of less than or equal to 5E-14, and single side bandphase noise level of no greater than -95 dBc in a 5 MHz output.  To remain compliant withcurrent and future FFTB hardware configurations, the unit must be contained in a standard3U rack-mountable assembly, and contain an internal battery backup ensuringtransportability.  In order to ensure successful testing of flight-qualified hardware forMMS and GPM missions, the unit must also have a mean time between failure (MTBF) ratinggreater than 145,000 hrs.  After conducting a thorough analysis of commercially availablereference oscillators, it was determined the Symmetricom, Inc. Cs4000 is the only productwhich can meet these requirements.  It is our understanding that the Symmetricom Cs4000is the only device capable of providing the required frequency stability and accuracy ina configuration which is compatible with FFTB requirements for rack space andtransportability. The government performed an exhaustive research and found that novendor other than Symmetricom, Inc met the necessary requirements.

<SUBJECT>Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Follow-On Study
<SOLNBR>NIH-NHLBI-HC-15A-10-07
<RESPDATE>030110
<CONTACT>Cheryl A Jennings, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-0347, Fax (301) 480-3430, Email cj19f@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH intends to negotiate on a non-competitive, sole source basis with Wake Forest University, the Coordinating Center for the Action to control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) to award a Follow-On Study. The cited authority is 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This effort will be a five-year follow-up of the ACCORD clinical trial participants.  This contractor has been involved in the recruitment, treatment strategies, follow-up, collection and analysis of data, and reporting of results on 10,251 participants from seven clinical networks across the United States and Canada. The incumbent contractor has the unique capability to provide these required services to NHLBI for the follow-up of the study.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study. The objectives of the study are detailed below.

Background and Purpose of the ACCORD Trial: About 24 million people (almost 8% of the U.S. population) have diabetes, which costs the nation an estimated $174 billion annually.  People with type 2 diabetes have 2-4 times the rate of major cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared to those without diabetes.  With increasing diabetes rates in the nation, the attributable risk of CVD due to diabetes is increasing.

The goal of the ACCORD trial is to address this public health challenge by testing three complementary medical treatment strategies to enhance the options for reducing CVD rates in people with diabetes. ACCORD is a randomized, multicenter, factorially designed clinical trial in 10, 000 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus conducted in 77 clinical sites across the U.S. and Canada.  The current infrastructure comprises 7 clinical networks, one coordinating center, a central laboratory, an ECG reading center, and a Drug Distribution Center. The trial has been ongoing since September 30, 1999. Wake Forest has been the coordinating center since then.

The trial was designed to test the effects on major CVD events of a therapeutic strategy to control glycemia to near-normal levels (target HbA1c < 6%) compared to a standard strategy (target HbA1c between 6% and 7%), of fibrates added to statins  (compared to statins alone) to increase HDL-cholesterol and lower triglycerides in the context of good LDL-C control, and of intensive BP control targeting the normal range (SBP< 120 mmHg) compared to a standard BP control strategy (SBP between 130 and 140 mmHg).  All 10,251 participants are in the glycemia trial; 5,518 are in the lipid trial and 4,733 are in the BP trial. The primary outcome for all 3 trials is first occurrence of a major CVD event (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CVD death). The trial included substudies on the investigation of the effects of the treatment strategies on cognition (the MIND substudy); on retinopathy and its progression over time (the EYE substudy); and the Health Quality of Life substudy. Each of these substudies involved substantial fractions of the overall ACCORD study participants. The recruitment phase was completed September 30, 2005 when the study surpassed their goal of 10,000 participants and recruited 10,251 participants.  In February, 2008, the ACCORD Glycemia protocol was modified due to safety concerns. All participants in the intensive Glycemia intervention arm were transitioned into the standard Glycemia treatment arm. The protocol remained otherwise unchanged with follow up continuing as planned until June 30, 2009.  After  June 30, 2009 all patients who give consent will have telephone only follow-up visits every six months (up to December 31, 2010) to assess the occurrence of major cardiovascular events

ACCORD Follow-On Study Objectives:  A 5-year observational ACCORD follow-on study is anticipated from September 30, 2010 through September 29, 2015.  During this time, all ACCORD participants will be invited to provide informed consent for continued follow-up measurements.  An estimated 92% of the original 10,251 participants is anticipated to be available for follow-up, based on current numbers of deaths, losses-to-follow-up, and refusals.

 

The follow-on will determine whether differences seen during the study in mortality, CVD events, and microvascular diseases persist or change over time and whether other differences emerge. The goals of the follow-up phase is to obtain key clinical, biological and ECG data that are similar in quality to those obtained during the trial period to enable examination of trends over time.  Examining morbidity and mortality from both macrovascular and microvascular diseases will provide a complete picture regarding long-term vascular outcomes from diabetes and the impact of glucose, blood pressure lowering, and lipid treatment on those outcomes. The follow-on phase will consist of periodic clinic visits for data collection and interim phone contacts to obtain information about clinical events.  Clinic visits would use streamlined approaches from current methods to obtain key clinically-relevant data that are the most important measures for the glycemia, BP, and lipid trials. Information to be collected would be detailed by investigators but is envisioned as including the following:  BP; medications; blood for HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, lipids, and creatinine; and urine for creatinine and albumin.  As currently, a central laboratory would conduct biological specimen analyses. ECGs would be obtained to identify silent myocardial infarctions, and clinical events would be adjudicated.  A specific protocol will be developed upon award.

It is anticipated that the National Eye Institute will continue funding an Eye substudy and that the National Institute on Aging will continue a cognitive substudy, and that the CDC will continue a Health Related Quality of Life substudy, as these substudies provide important clinical information.

The Coordinating Centers expected responsibilities that will continue during the follow on phase include (but are not limited to) all data management and analysis activities including the documentation and maintenance of appropriate confidentiality and security of files for the study and substudies; lead the development of the protocol and manuals of procedures development; monitor the regulatory aspects of the study; establish standardized quality of data gathering; continue to maintain a morbidity/mortality monitoring and adjudication system; maintain quality control and monitoring of the performance status of the clinical sites; solicit and monitor core laboratories such as central ECG and  chemistry laboratory; coordinate, arrange, participate in, and provide any information necessary for regular Steering Committee, Observations Study Monitoring Board, training and other necessary study meetings; and provide technical reports as required by the Government (up to one quarterly and a final).

The contract will require an extensive comparison of the ongoing clinical trial study, which will cover the activities above.  We anticipate subcontracting opportunities during the course of this contract.  For instance, there will be a need to establish an ECG Reading Center and a Laboratory Center.
 
This notice of intent expires 15-days from its posting. This is not a request for proposals (RFP). The estimated award date is December 1, 2010.  All responsible sources may submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants. Any interested parties in this or potential subcontracting opportunities may contact, Cheryl A. Jennings, Contracting Officer, cj19f@nih.gov, 301-435-0347.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Verita Friesner
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to change the offer due date to 2/25/2011 at 1200 PS.
Amendment 0001 - Notice of Intent , 0040003676, G11PS00113
The U.S. Geological (USGS), Alaska Science Center, has a requirement for Services, Non-Personal, to provide all labor, tools, personnel, and management necessary to provide for 20 Locus Genotypes for 808 Each, Polar Bear Samples and 212 Each, Polar Bear Tissue Samples, in accordance with the Statement of Work.
The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b), (1), to Wildlife Genetics International (WGI), Nelson, BC, Canada, for unique Polar Bear tissue sample genotyping.  The contractor has previously genotyped USGS Alaska Science Center polar bear samples and also a large number of tissue samples from polar bears collected by Canadian researchers.  It is critical for the research that the entire database of genetic information is internally consistent, and an important component of our research requires that our data be directly comparable with similar data collected by USGS and other Polar Bear researchers.  To our knowledge, there are no other efforts made to standardize the 20 loci listed: G1A, G10B, G10C, G1D, G10H, G10J, G10M, MU50, MU59, G10P, G10U, G10X, CXX110, CXX20, CXX173, REN145P07, Mu51, Msut2, and CPH9.  For the subset of 212 bears whose sex is unknown, the contractor will also determine their sex using a genetic sex marker.
Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  This is not an RFQ.  This does represent the Government's only written notice of this procurement.  
All responsible sources may submit a response which if timely received, must be considered by the agency.
All questions and requests regarding this procurement shall be in writing, and addressed to Cheryl Fitch at cfitch@usgs.gov no later than 2/23/2011.

<CONTACT>David W. Bryan, Contract Negotiator, Phone 8017755338, Email david.bryan@hill.af.mil
<DESC><p>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI). This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The following information is provided to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully provide the described capability. 508th Aircraft Sustainment Group, Hill AFB, UT intends to award a two (2) year contract to support the USAF in the procurement of retrofitted Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) Lower Helmet Vehicle Interface (LHVI) cables with a new Quick Disconnect Connector (QDC) with connector saver inserts for installation on USAF F-16 Block 40 through 52 aircraft. The QDC is a component of the LHVI cable (NSN 6150-01-521-3205 CW) which connects the pilot's JHMCS helmet to the F-16 Blocks 40 through 52 aircraft. The QDC gets exercised each time a pilot who is equipped with a JHMCS helmet enters or exits the cockpit by connecting the cable from the helmet to the cable in the aircraft. When a JHMCS helmet is not present, the LHVI cable remains in a vulnerable unmated stowage bracket. The connector saver is a connector device that goes into the LHVI cable QDC and will mate with helmet cable. This repair and retrofit involves adding a replaceable connector saver into the existing LHVI QDC. In order to accommodate the additional connector saver, the QDC is replaced with a new QDC that is .6" longer than original. The connector saver shall provide means for field restoration of the plug and receptacle interface of the QDC aircraft half. The requirement is for the contractor to repair and retrofit 651 JHMCS LHVI cables from the aircraft and 236 spare cables with a new QDC and connector saver (P/N 178-6800) to include kits and spares for both the QDC and connector savers for installation on the aircraft. This requirement also includes the contractor to provide program support, training for the OO-ALC F-16 and WR-ALC engineers and equipment specialists, written instructions and drawings for removal and insertion of connector savers. Potential offers are requested to provide an executive summary; relevant history and evidence of past performance/capability to perform the tasking not to exceed 0 pages. Information submitted should be pertinent and specific to that which is indicative of the offeror's capabilities to successfully perform this effort. A vendor point of contract, including an email address must be included in your response. The government does NOT intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for information solicited herein. Copies of your submitted information will be distributed to the AF engineer and contracting officer for review. Interested parties are requested to submit three (3) copies of the aforementioned summary to David Bryan, 508 oo-ALC/GHBK, 6072 Fir Ave, Bldg 1233, Hill AFB UT, 84056-5820 no later than 14 calendar days after publication of this notice. No telephone or FAX responses will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This Is A Request For Information Announcement For Purposes Of Conducting Market Research Only.  There Is No Solicitation Available At This Time.  Requests For A Solicitation Will Not Receive A Response.  <BR><BR>The U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is conducting market research to identify fabric materials with protection capabilities that would be suitable for use in a duty uniform for state and local law enforcement.  The National Protection Center (NPC), NSRDEC, is conducting this effort on behalf of the National Institute of Justice (NIJ).  The objective of this program is to identify textile materials that will improve the current level of protection of law enforcement officers while maintaining the current levels of comfort, appearance, and durability.  Current law enforcement duty uniforms provide minimum levels of protection.  This information will be used by state and local law enforcement to select a uniform material with improved protection capabilities for their specific operational requirements. <BR><BR>Candidate materials will be classified by weight per Section I below.  Three mandatory categories (comfort, appearance & durability) of material characteristics are defined below in Section II.  All material candidates should meet the required criteria for comfort, appearance and durability, however, material candidates that do not meet the required criteria will be considered if technical data for all criteria is provided.  Desired protection capabilities are defined below in Section III.  A candidate material does not need to provide all of the desired protection capabilities as the specific requirement for material protection capability varies across the spectrum of law enforcement agencies.  Consequently, multiple material candidates, with different types or levels of protection capability, may be submitted.      <BR><BR>I. Candidate materials will be assigned to one of two weight classes, based on weight:  <BR>1. Class I: Lightweight - Materials weighing less than 5.75 oz/yd2<BR>2. Class II: Midweight/heavyweight - Materials weighing 5.75 oz/yd2 or more. <BR><BR>II. All materials should meet the following levels of comfort, appearance and durability, as determined by the following test methods:<BR>1. Comfort - <BR>a. Air permeability, per ASTM D 737-04.  Class I - 50.0 ft3/min/ft2, Class II - 10.0 ft3/min/ft2<BR>2. Appearance<BR>a. Material appearance, per AATCC 143-2006<BR>b. Colorfastness, per AATCC 8-2005, 16-2004, 61-2006, and 15-2002<BR>3. Durability<BR>a. Abrasion resistance, per ASTM D 3884-07. Class I - 300 cycles without failure, Class II - 500 cycles without failure.<BR>b. Burst strength, per ASTM D 3787-07 (applies to knit materials only).  Class I & II - 50 lbf.<BR>c. Tear strength, per ASTM D 1424-07a (applies to woven & non-woven only).  Class I - Warp: 6 lbf (woven & non-woven), Fill: 4 lbf (woven only).  Class II - Warp: 9 lbf (woven & non-woven), Fill: 6 lbf (woven only).   <BR>d. Material breaking strength, per ASTM D 5034-95 (2001) (woven & non-woven only).  Class I & II - Warp: 160 lbf (woven), Fill: 80 lbf (woven), 160 lbf (nonwoven only).   <BR>e. Seam/closure breaking strength, ASTM D 5034-95 (2001). Class I - 45 lbf, Class II -  55 lbf <BR>f. Dimensional stability, per AATCC 135-2003<BR>Technical testing data for the above criteria must be included in your response.  Data should include the test results, who performed the testing and when it was performed.  Complete testing reports are not required.  Materials that do not meet some of the above criteria will still be considered, if technical data is supplied identifying the level of the shortcoming.<BR><BR>III. A candidate material shall meet one or more of the following protection capabilities.  The material protection capabilities will be defined by the following test methods:<BR>1. Blood borne pathogen resistance, per ASTM F 1671-3.<BR>2. Cut resistance, per ASTM F 1790-05. <BR>3. Flame resistance, per ASTM D 6413-99. <BR>4. Puncture resistance, per ASTM F 1342-05. <BR>5. Water repellency, per AATCC 22. <BR>6. Ultra Violet (UV) resistance, per AATCC 183-2004.<BR>Responses must identify the protection capability(s) claimed.  Technical testing data that validates a protection capability must be included in your response.  Materials that do not meet the above criteria for a protection capability will still be considered, if technical data is supplied identifying the level of the protection shortcoming. <BR><BR>The information provided in response to this announcement will be evaluated by the program office.  Based on the technical data provided by each respondent, the program office will determine which materials may require additional test and evaluation.  The testing will characterize and verify the levels of comfort, appearance and durability as well as any protection performance capabilities.  The results of this program will be used by law enforcement to make informed decisions regarding the selection of materials for next generation duty uniforms.   <BR><BR>Because this material is not intended for a Department of Defense or a Department of Homeland Security application nor is the procurement of a law enforcement duty uniform subject to FEMA grant funding, this survey is open to all sources of textile material, both foreign and domestic, to include small businesses.  However, local agencies may or may not have procurement rules or regulations pertaining to sourcing of materials. Consequently, sourcing of material will need to be identified in order to meet that possible requirement.<BR><BR>Respondents to this request for information shall submit: <BR>1. A physical description of the material, including weight per square yard, and identify which protection capabilities are offered by this material.<BR>2. Test data, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above, to characterize the comfort, durability and appearance of the material. <BR>3. Test data, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above, to characterize the protection performance of the material.<BR>4. Indicate whether additional material is available for purchase and the lead time required for purchase.  <BR>5. Identify the sourcing (foreign or domestic) of the material.<BR>6. Identify the cost of the material ($ USD/square yard).<BR>7. Any information of prior use of this material in another uniform application.<BR>8. Any attachments shall be in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format.<BR><BR>The Government will not reimburse any business concern for any information submitted in response to this sources sought request.  Submission of information or samples is voluntary.  Any proprietary information will be held confidential.  Business concerns submitting responses should indicate whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone or service disabled veteran owned small business.  Large business concerns are not prohibited from responding to this announcement.  <BR> <BR>This program is a research and development program only.  There is no planned procurement action that will accompany this program.  Should a procurement of any material evaluated by this program eventually occur, this solicitation will not be conducted by the Army.  <BR><BR>All interested business concerns are required to respond to this request for information announcement via email no later than Friday, 29 Apr 2011, 3:00 p.m. EDT.   Responses must include company point of contact, email address, telephone and fax numbers.  All interested business concerns responding to this announcement shall send their submission to Fred Chan via email at fred.chan@us.army.mil.  All technical questions regarding this sources sought announcement should be directed via email towards Fred Chan at fred.chan@us.army.mil.<BR>	<BR>

<DESC>Sources Sought for the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Project Deployment ReleaseActuatorsThe Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission is the fourth mission of the SolarTerrestrial Probe (STP) program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA). The MMS mission will use four identically instrumented observatories to performthe first definitive study of magnetic reconnection in space and will test criticalhypotheses about reconnection. Magnetic reconnection is the primary process by whichenergy is transferred from the solar wind to the Earths magnetosphere and is alsofundamental to the explosive release of energy during substorms and solar flares. The MMS mission will study magnetic reconnection in the Earths magnetosphere. The fourMMS observatories will be required to fly in a tetrahedral formation in order tounambiguously determine the orientation of the magnetic reconnection layer. The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI)to solicit information about potential sources for approximately thirty-four (34)Deployment Release Actuator flight units for the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Project.

<p>NSTec, a DOE Contractor to the United States Department of Energy, is seeking qualified and experienced sources to design and produce prototype pixilated sensors.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is for businesses, NAICS code 334516 capable of meeting the requirements to design a low resolution pixilated sensor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Design a low resolution pixilated sensor array, optimize sensitivity and minimize noise. Pixels range 20 to 200 <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">m</span>m, array dimensions up to 100 x 100 (Possibly prototype a sub array). Target array area 3 mm square to minimize prototype fabrication cost. Plan for air cooled Thermal Electric Cooler (TEC) and room temperature operation. Consider hybrid sensor with a back-illuminated sensor array with a custom complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) readout. Consider back-thinning CMOS to achieve high quantum efficiency (QE) at target wavelengths. Target 100% fill factor. Target 95% peak QE at 540 nm. An alternate design may be considered to peak QE at 420 nm. Pixel binning will be utilized to adjust sensitivity; up to 32 x 32 or entire array if this is practical. Fast clock rate is not essential. Dark current should be minimized with design and operational considerations. Target exposure time range from 0.1 seconds to 10 seconds, possibly utilizing a non-destructive readout mode to lengthen exposure time while removing dark current. Digital signal output is preferred. Radiation sensitivity should be a consideration.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information for planning purposes. This RFI is not a request for proposals; therefore, responses to this notice will not be considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a contract. Parties that respond to this RFI are advised that the NRC will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the submitting party's expense. <br />PURPOSE<br />The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) seeks information to determine the commercial availability and technical capabilities of qualified responsible sources and/or Government Shared Service Providers that are currently capable of providing solutions for the work described here-in. The information that NRC gathers from this RFI and related market research is for planning purposes only and will be used to assist the NRC in planning its acquisition strategy.<br />BACKGROUND<br />The NRC, Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) is the current sponsor of the NRC's Human Resource Management System (HRMS). The customized commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product from PeopleSoft that is currently used by NRC for this purpose is comprised of four modules: Human Resources (HR), Time and Labor (T&amp;L), Payroll, and Training Administration (TA). In November 2001, the NRC implemented the four PeopleSoft HRMS modules: HR, T&amp; L, Payroll, and TA. In 2002, the NRC planned to upgrade the 7.51 version of PeopleSoft to 8.3. However, as part of the President's Management Agenda to streamline common Federal payroll systems and processes referred to as e-Payroll, the NRC was directed to cross-service its payroll operations with the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)/National Business Center (NBC) using FPPS. As a result, NRC delayed the HRMS system upgrade and in November 2003, converted its HR and Payroll systems to FPPS located in Denver, Colorado and converted Training Administration to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) iLearn. Historical HR and Payroll data (i.e., data prior to November 2003) were not converted during the transition to FPPS. The historical information continues to be used to support business operations at the NRC. The current HRMS' primary use is to collect time, attendance, and labor data from approximately 4,600 personnel. HRMS is currently housing historical HR and Payroll data and official training records for all NRC employees.
<p>In 2005, the OCFO conducted two studies. The first study was to evaluate alternatives for T&amp;L and the second to ascertain if the current T&amp;L business process policy and procedures met the business needs of the agency. Both studies confirmed NRC's implementation of T&amp;L met programmatic needs for the agency. However, both studies confirmed that a customized COTS solution continued to best serve the agency in meeting its multiple uses for the information. T&amp;L information is used to compensate employees, to bill licensees, to recover costs from other Government agencies, to formulate and execute budgets, to manage project-level resources and analytics, and to support cost management practices and decision-making.<br />In 2007, a business process improvement effort for the integration of T&amp;L and fee billing processes, described process improvements that can only be supported by a custom COTS solution. NRC initiated a project to upgrade T&amp;L from PeopleSoft 7.5 to PeopleSoft Time and Labor 9.0 as an intermediary solution. Since then, the NRC is researching alternative solutions to managing a T&amp;L system in-house at NRC.</p>
<p>Questions for Respondents<br />In order for NRC to learn about current marketplace offerings and capabilities, NRC strongly encourages that parties respond in writing to the questions below. Please correlate the response to the question number.<br />1. What is your company with respect to NAICS code 541511 (i.e. "small" or "other than small")? If your organization is a small business, what type of small business (i.e. small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, 8(a), or HUBZone small business?) Specify all that apply.<br />2. Does your organization have experience implementing FISMA-compliant cloud computing solutions for the Federal Government ? If so, please so indicate and describe those contracts (contract number, contract type, contract value, description of supplies and services included in the scope, period of performance, etc.) and indicate your organization's role (prime contractor, first tier subcontractor, and/or supplier)<br />3. Does your company currently manufacture or resell product solutions (i.e,, hardware and/or software) for HR, T&amp; L, Payroll, and/or TA requirements? If so, please describe those solutions, including hardware, software, services, etc. and include commercial price list(s) or range of prices for those commercial offerings. These may be cloud-based or non-cloud-based solutions. If your company is a reseller for product solutions, then please indicate what those solutions are and provide commercial price list(s) or current range of prices for those commercial offerings.<br />4. Please indicate what commercial solutions (cloud or other) that you believe would be feasible and cost effective alternatives for NRC to consider, and why, to replace its current PeopleSoft HRMS solution for HR, T&amp; L, Payroll, and TA requirements. Provide supporting justification for your positions. In providing this assessment, please also disclose if your organization is a reseller for any of those solutions.<br />5. Does your company have experience with operating a helpdesk in support of a new system implementation? If yes, please explain that experience and address what process was used for issue tracking.<br />Indicate whether your company sells HR, T&amp; L, Payroll, and/or TA solutions on existing Federal Government contracts (i.e., GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract or a GWAC contract) that NRC could order from and, if so, provide the contract number(s) and indicate what is available for ordering frome each of those contracts.<br />Instructions/Requirements for Submitting RFI Responses to NRC:<br />Please in submitting responses please do so by e-mail to william.adams@nrc.gov by no later than 5:00 PM, 17 March, 2011.

<DESC>This is a source sought notice. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting market research to determine the availability of responsible companies that have the capabilities to perform the work discussed herein. This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.<br /><br />Scope<br /><br />The use of software tools in safety-related system design, code generation, and testing may reduce human errors and enhance the integrity of the safety-related system, thereby producing a more reliable system. It is anticipated that the use of software tools in safety-related system design, development, maintenance, and operation will increase. However, the use of software tools may also introduce errors when software tools have undetected faults. These faults may have a severe impact if the safety-related system is compromised. Therefore, it is desired to assess the safety assurance of software tools used in safety-related system design, development, maintenance, and operation. There are some industry standards on the requirements for the use of software tools in safety-critical systems that may be helpful for the NRC's review process. However, these standards are normally high level, abstract, and not detailed enough as a set of criterion easily applicable to the NRC review process.<br /><br />The NRC Staff is interested in research and development of more detailed methods, guidance, and criteria that build upon industry standards and meet NRC regulatory requirements. The methods, guidance and criteria will be particularly designed for safety assessment of software tools used in safety-related systems in Nuclear Power Plants, will be technically and logically sound, easy to implement in the NRC review process and provide clear relationships with the high level industry standards.<br />Ultimately, NRC Staff will also need to determine what, if any, changes to NRC regulations, internal guidance or its current review process in connection with the use of software tools for safety-related systems in Nuclear Power Plants may be appropriate.<br /><br />These requirements apply both to the responding organization and to the individual persons who will be involved in this effort. For any person or organization not meeting ALL of the specified requirements, respondents should explain why particular requirements should not be considered applicable.<br /><br />Submission Information<br />NRC is performing market research to locate companies that can provide research that can meet or exceed the qualifications specified below. Companies shall provide the following in response to this sources sought notice:<br /><br />1. The experience that their company has with software tool development, testing, and<br />applications, including, for example, experience in:<br />Software tool requirement specification<br />Software tool design specification<br />Software tool code development<br />Software tool configuration management<br />Software tool integration<br />Software tool testing, verification, and validation<br />Software tool quality assurance<br />Software reliability<br />2. Their understanding of the importance of software reliability in safety-related<br />systems, and have extensive experience in software tool applications to safety- related systems.<br />3. Experience and familiarity with regulations and guidance of the United States<br />Nuclear Regulatory Commission and in applicable laws and requirement<br />4. Lack of Conflict-of-Interest concerns, both in regard to individual persons and in<br />regard to organizations (see commercial / legal considerations elsewhere in this<br />solicitation).<br />5. Their expertise in software reliability and software quality assurance, evidenced by publication of research papers and technical reports directed toward expert and general<br />6. Experience, projects, and publications that demonstrate the respondent's capabilities in these areas.<br />7. Any other documentation or evidence that your company believes demonstrates appropriate qualification and capabilities.<br />8. The business size is your company with respect to NAICS code 541512 (i.e. small or other than small)? If your company is a small business, what type of small business (i.e. small disadvantaged, woman, veteran, service-disabled veteran, 8(a), and HUBZone)?<br />9. Information on the services their company has available on the commercial market?<br />10. A recommended contract type for services of this nature (firm fixed price, fixed price incentive, cost, cost plus fixed fee or cost plus incentive fee).<br />11. Does your company currently offer these services on GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and/or Governmentwide Acquisition Contract(s) (GWAC)?<br />12. If your company has an enterprise contract with any other companies or government agencies, please so indicate and describe those contracts. How they are structured? (Contract type, Contract Value, etc.).<br />13. Describe experience, projects, and publications that demonstrate the company's capabilities in these areas,<br />14. Show that your company has the necessary resources to provide technical services in these efforts.<br />Also, please provide any specific qualifications are not applicable to your organizations.<br />Please note that sources sought responses including the Appendix must not exceed 25 pages in length. Use single-spaced, 12-point, font.<br />Although all comments received will be carefully reviewed and considered for inclusion in any possible later action, the initiators of this request make no commitment to include any particular recommendations. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.<br /><br />All responses to this notice should only include responses to the questions presented in this notice. Responses that do not directly address the questions in this notice will not be considered by NRC in developing its acquisition strategy.<br /><br />Responses to this notice shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer,dominique.malone@nrc.gov, with a courtesy copy to joseph.widdup@nrc.gov, no later than the closing date for this notice.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires copies of studies originally completed by Universal Strategy Group under a separate purchase order. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Universal Strategy Group, Inc. Interested parties may e-mail alyson.gowin@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Attn: Alyson Gowin, not later than March 3, 2011 by 9:00AM EST.
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE(APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)<br />USSOCOM issued a purchase order to Universal Strategy Group Inc to produce two studies - Directed Study of Iran and Directed Study of Lebanese Hezbollah. The studies were completed and furnished to USSOCOM under contract H9222-10-P-0091. USGI approached USSOCOM with an unsolicited proposal. USSOCOM accepted their proposal and formed an agreement with the company in sharing the intellectual capital of the process, the specific details of which are classified. USGI agrees not to share their research process with anyone else unless USSOCOM approves and as long as USSOCOM does not share the process with anyone outside the scope of USSOCOMs mission. The studies themselves are unclassified but the process by which they are put together, the knowledge of where they are and where they are going is classified. USSOCOM now needs additional copies of the studies that were completed (1,000 of each). Since USGI conducted the studies and produced the original documents containing the results of the studies and due to the unique classified agreement USSOCOM has with USGI, they are the only company able to provide USSOCOM with copies of the two studies.</p>

<DESC>NASA intends to increase the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) taskmaximum order ceiling of the contract with GeoControl Systems, Inc. entitled IndependentVerification and Validation (IV&V) Tools Lab, Contract No. NNG06DA08C on a sole-sourcebasis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of GoddardSpace Flight Centers (GSFC) Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Program.  TheNASA IV&V Tools Lab contract supports the NASA IV&V program by providing management,continuous improvement, training and engineering services for the Computer Aided SoftwareEngineering (CASE) tools that are utilized by the IV&V Program.  This increase in themaximum order quantity ceiling is necessary to continue existing task orders until thecompetitive follow-on contract is awarded.  The follow-on effort entitled NASA IVVSoftware Assurance Tools Group Support which was published on January 25, 2011, will beissued as a small business set-aside and is scheduled for award on or about September 1,2011. The solicitation for the follow-on effort is expected to be released on or beforeApril 22, 2011.  The increase in maximum order quantity is necessary in order to ensureprogram continuity and critical mission support and to avoid significant technicalimpacts to the IV&V program.  An interruption and restart of this effort, with a newcontractor that is unfamiliar with the specific requirements of NASAs IV&V program,would greatly jeopardize the success of NASAs IV&V mission.	GeoControl Systems, Inc.as the current incumbent has the combined training, experience, and expertise to provideuninterrupted continuation of mission critical support.  Due to the time and substantialduplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, GeoControlSystems, Inc. is considered the only contractor that can meet GSFCs needs given the shortperiod of time until the new requirement is put in place.  Interested organizations maysubmit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to theidentified point of contact not later than 3:00 PM local time on March 3, 2011.  Suchcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

Explain:
In 2009, the NPS awarded contract P9504090016 to Donald O'Brien for completion of eight short films featuring NPS scientists working in North Coast & Cascades Network parks.  In producing that original group of eight films, Donald retained unused "B Roll" footage, featuring additional personnel interviews, scenic views, and wildlife.  The NPS will award a new contract to Donald using the "B Roll" footage to produce another group of eight films.  This new group of eight films is considered a follow-on requirement to the original contract because the "B Roll" footage being used is one-of-a-kind, owned by Donald O'Brien, and no other entity, public or private, can access.  NPS only wants the final product, the completed eight films.  Donald is the only one with access to the footage as the original owner, and therefore is the only source.NPS was extremely satisfied with the quality of the original eight films that Donald produced.  Donald O'Brien has the experience, expertise, and capability of producing another group of eight films for the NPS, with minimum cost and effort.  No new site visits or additional videography will be required.  Donald will produce the new group of films solely from the available "B Roll" footage, of which he retained, and owns.  
3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:
The original eight films cost $15,320.  The NPS has the unique opportunity, two years later, to procure another group of eight films at roughly the same price.  The NPS did not pursue seeking out additional sources because no other vendors have access to Donald's extra, unused "B Roll" footage from the previous contract.  Without that, a vendor would need to start from scratch, with all new footage, site visits, field interviews, etc.  This would significantly increase cost, and not meet the intent of the project, which is to keep costs at a minimum by using previously shot footage.  
4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:a.  Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b.  The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<a href="mailto:scott.ivy@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Temperature Controls, B&W Contract Services, Hines VA
VA69D-11-RQ-0174

1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the repair/service/maintenance of temperature controls for the entire Hines VA grounds.  This procurement will proceed on an emergency sole source basis with B&W Contract Services.

3.	A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  The VA Hospital in Hines, IL, has a requirement for a short term interim service contract to maintain and service all the temperature controls on the Hines VA campus. This service is emergency essential. The approximate cost for 4 months is $277,785.00 

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2.  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)) due to Unusual and compelling urgency.

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The VA Hospital in Hines, IL requires this service because it is emergency essential to have heat and air conditioning in all of the buildings on campus. Presently, Facilities Management Service does not have adequate staff, especially certified HVAC technicians (e.g., Associated Air Balance Council, National Environmental Balancing Bureau, Testing, Adjusting & Balancing Bureau, Honeywell controls, Metasys controls, American Automatrix controls, Alerton controls, etc.) to perform needed temperature control maintenance and services.  All of the control systems are proprietary and are inaccessible by Hines HVAC mechanics and operators.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  It is the belief of FMS that this contract will affect the safety of patients if not provided by the current contractor until a long term contract is able to be competitively awarded. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Hines FMS is diligently working with the GLAC in a combined effort to establish a sustainable contract that covers all facets of operations to ensure a technically competent contractor is found who is able to fulfill the requirements of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The complexity of the content of the SOW, obtaining an IGCE and identifying all equipment by type, location and serial number has taken longer than expected due to the sheer size and magnitude of Hines VAMC and the limited staff of FMS. The scope of work to be completed is extremely technical and has combined what used to be numerous contracts into one streamlined contract to realize a cost savings to the Government and ease of technical oversight by FMS and Contracting. 

8.	Market survey conducted:  There was no survey conducted. All pricing and facts are based on historical data, past procurements and market research going back well over ten years.
 
9.	Other facts:  B&W is a SDVOSB contractor who has been the incumbent for approximately 12 years on this contract. Due to the critical Infrastructure and the nature of work needed, the current company's knowledge of the facility and equipment makes it the only company capable of providing the required critical life support required for these services. B&W is the only company with the ability to maintain the current level of service being provided until a new permanent contract able to be competitively bid and be placed in service. It is not possible for a new company to mobilize, learn the equipment, obtain all licenses and provide emergency services due to the size and massive infrastructure of Hines VAMC.  
The establishment of this contract will ensure continuity of primary care for our veterans who are in extended care and require surgical critical care with the facility.  Any failure of a temperature control system, chillers or other HVAC system components will require the shutdown of critical patient care areas and the surgical service to go on a sustained period of by-pass.

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None sought

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge, based on historical data going back well over ten years.

<DESC>Under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1, the VISN 19 Rocky Mountain Consolidated Contracting Center, Denver, CO, proposes to enter into a non-competitive commercial items contract with Care Outcomes Management.

The Eastern Colorado Health Care System (ECHCS), Research Services at the Department of Veteran Affairs, in Denver Colorado has a requirement for a Specialized Research Nurse to support the Integrated Telehealth Care Management and Tobacco Cessation Study Program for Veterans with PTSD study at the Eastern Colorado Health Care System. We require a contractor that can begin work on this critical program immediately and provide services for this customized study.

The services require a very specific skill set in telehealth care management intervention to provide several functions.  These include: 1) care management, 2) motivational interviewing, 3) tobacco cessation curriculum development and 4) tobacco cessation counseling.  The contractor must have excellent program management skills and project team dynamics experience.  We seek someone with experience in the development of the original evidenced based VA tobacco cessation curriculum and trained as a counselor using motivational interviewing in 2008.  

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within the due date for receipt of proposals will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL TO PROCURE
USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Upon the basis of the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

JUSTIFICATION

1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.

The Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 1055 Clermont Street, Denver, CO 80220
Rocky Mountain Consolidated Contracting Center, VISN 19, 4100 East Mississippi Ave, Glendale, CO  80246

2.  Nature/description of action.

This activity proposes to solicit sole source with Care Outcomes Management to provide nursing assistance for the Integrated Telehealth Care Management and Tobacco Cessation for Veterans with PTSD study at the Eastern Colorado Health Care System. We require a contractor that can begin work on this critical program immediately and provide services for this customized study.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.

To provide a research nurse to support the Integrated Telehealth Care Management and Tobacco Cessation for Veterans with PTSD intervention study director by Dr. Catherine Battaglia.

The Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center
1055 Clermont Street
 Denver, CO 80220
Quote: 
Estimated Price = $75.00 (0.30 FTE)

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.

The Integrated Telehealth Care Management and Tobacco Cessation for Veterans with PTSD is a care intervention study within the REAP at the Denver VAMC.  The telehealth care management intervention requires a highly qualified nurse to provide several functions.  These include: 1) care management, 2) motivational interviewing, 3) tobacco cessation curriculum development and 4) tobacco cessation counseling.  Care Outcomes Management has the exact skill set needed to fill this need immediately.  In addition to having the skill set that we need, Cares Outcomes Management will save us weeks of training someone not intimately familiar with the study. They have worked on this REAP care management intervention study using telehealth as a nursing doctorate student (2007-2009). During this time, they worked together to develop the DOVA's  Tobacco Cessation curriculum used in the research program, developed tobacco cessation and motivational interviewing training materials and a quality improvement process.  

The research intervention uses the PTSD Health Buddy (telehealth) program, motivational interviewing counseling, tobacco cessation counseling, and nursing care coordination for veterans throughout the ECHCS. Therefore, this research study requires a nurse with experience in patient care coordination, telehealth, PTSD, tobacco cessation, and motivational interviewing. Care Outcomes Management is 100% qualified and is a graduate of the Doctoral of Nursing Practice (DNP) program at the University of Colorado, College of Nursing where she gained a foundation in research studies. Care Outcomes Management has an advanced practice nurse who has worked with veterans with PTSD at the VA PTSD Residential PTSD Outpatient Unit.  They also worked with patients diagnosed with other mental health problems. They wrote the original evidenced based VA tobacco cessation curriculum in 2007-2008 and were trained as a counselor using motivational interviewing in 2008.  Motivational interviewing is a specialized form of patient-centered counseling. It requires specific training and regular use to be effective. Care Outcomes Management will perform the following functions: 

1.	Write tobacco cessation curriculum for medical chronic care conditions
2.	Revise the tobacco cessation curriculum for other mental health conditions in addition to PTSD
3.	Conduct telephone motivational interviewing counseling calls with research participants
4.	Assist with recruitment and enrollment of study participants
5.	Assist with completing COMIRB applications for newly funded research studies

6.  Description of Efforts to Ensure Soliciting  of as Many Sources as Possible.

This acquisition will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site as a sole-source procurement. Questions concerning this procurement's qualification as a sole-source procurement can be raised by the public at that time. 

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.

The rate of $75/hr is considered a fair and reasonable cost for the proposed services rendered based on similar positions at the VA (see below).  It is unusual to find a candidate with all these skills. Care Outcomes Management volunteered their time for 2 years working with me as a graduate student. Care Outcomes Management is intimately familiar with this project and requires very little orientation.

8.  Description of Market Survey.

The telehealth nurse salary was used as a guide. The $75.00/hour  rate is the contract rate since no benefits are provided with contractors. 
Also, negotiated rates for specialized nurses under random samplings of the FSS schedules average $68/hour. We believe the additional premium is justified based on their involvement with the initial involvement in the development of the original study, knowledge of our policies and procedures, computer applications and their unique skill set that match the requirements needed for this position.

9.  Any Other Supporting Data.

There are no other factors supporting the use of other than full and open competition. 

10.  Listing of Interested Sources.

Care Outcomes Management

11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.

As this is not a recurring acquisition, there are no actions that may be taken to overcome barriers to acquisition.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>Arlington National Cemetery requests that a Iron railed entrance way gate be removed from its bearings, and brackets, to facilitate a repair which would restore the gate to "as new" condition, and then reinstalled and checked for proper operation. The repair will include,( but not be limited to, )straightening  all vertical and horizontal parts of the gate stock. This will possibly require cutting out and welding new material in sections where the metal is deformed. The deformed gate is one part of a double gate system, and must be repaired in such a way as to continue to mirror the other side of the gate.  The gate is attached to a stone post by four (4), U-shaped brackets that have lost metal material due to age and wear. These brackets will need to be repaired or replaced, and new bearings installed "if needed", to return the gate to its proper non sagging aspect.  While the gate is being repaired, the Contractor shall place a temporary and securable gate, (or fence), in the space the gate was removed from.  The gate is composed of iron or mild steel round vertical posts, and squared  stock frame, straight across the bottom of the gate, and curved at the top highest point down to the horizontal end of the top of the gate.  The highest point of the gate is approximately 129' tall on one end, curved down to approximately 89' on the other end. The gate is approximately 199' wide and has a horizontal flat separator piece approximately 40" from the bottom. For a site visit or further information contact Haydee SotoCarreras at 703-428-0670.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of IV Catheters. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br />The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South Wellford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support (TS), Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<br />This IA standardization initiative will be a Two Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product samples for clinical evaluation. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is April 2011. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise after consideration of technical requirements, clinical and pricing factors. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance expectations will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and 808-433-3686, Wendy Sprouse, MMESO Pacific Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse.ctr@us.army.mil and 808-433-7985.</strong>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of IV Catheters. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $9,601,711. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, twenty six (26) line items of the total one hundred six (106) line items, account for 84.1% ($8,072,718) of the total volume in sales ($9,601,711) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 26 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFQ to Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Ms. Wendy Sprouse, Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse.ctr@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendors' initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that their initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Pacific via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. The MMESO Pacific will request responses to the technical/company criteria, no charge literature, no charge sample sets, and best available pricing from each interested vendor.</p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by DSLs and co-chaired by DSCs in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs AND a tier pricing in the event of a multiple vendor selection for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendors must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Vendors who do not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. The vendors who meet the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical requirements outlined below. The six (6) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement;<br />1. Vendor MUST provide a line of IV Catheters products that includes at a minimum the specific products identified below for IV Catheters: single use and disposable, latex free/safe, does not contain PVC, has catheter hub that is compatible with IV tubing, and the safety feature is an integral part of the device and not an accessory. <br />a.<br />14 GA 1 1/4 inch Radiopaque Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />14 GA 3-1/4 inch Radiopaque Latex Free IV Catheter <br />16 GA 1-1/4 inch Radiopaque Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />18 GA 1-1/8 inch Radiopaque Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />18 GA 1-1/8 inch Radiopaque Winged Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />18 GA 1-1/4 inch Radiopaque Winged Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />18 GA 1-1/4 inch Radiopaque Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />20 GA 1 inch Radiopaque Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />20 GA 1-1/4 inch Radiopaque Winged Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />20 GA 1-1/4 inch Radiopaque Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />22 GA 1 inch Radiopaque Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />24 GA 1/2 inch Radiopaque Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />24 GA 1/2 inch Radiopaque Winged Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />24 GA 3/4 inch Radiopaque Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br /><br />b. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufacture <br />and/or distribute by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as stated above will be disqualified in Phase I).<br />c. Operational usage items are included in this list of IV Catheters. <br />2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the IV Catheters product line. Vendor MUST provide the DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal. Vendors without a DAPA number or those that have not applied for a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />3. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Med/Surg prime vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for IV Catheters or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. Vendors whose products are not available through the Prime Vendors or who have not applied for PV distribution will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />4. Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for the products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.).<br />Phase II Clinical Performance and Pricing Analysis.<br />Clinical Performance Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the MMESO Pacific, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendors will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendors who cannot or do not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. All vendors must send the MMESO Pacific verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, and tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). One (1) box of each gauge and length listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites that will be identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>18 GA 1-1/4 inch Radiopaque Winged Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />18 GA 1-1/4 inch Radiopaque Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />24 GA 1/2 inch Radiopaque Latex Free Safety IV Catheter<br />24 GA 1/2 inch Radiopaque Winged Latex Free Safety IV Catheter</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)-Completely unacceptable, two (2)-overwhelmingly unacceptable, three (3)-partially unacceptable, four (4)-acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable. The MMESO TPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. Vendors scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those Vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Vendors that have been disqualified or have not been selected will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (CAC approval of selection). Clinical /performance evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Pacific, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review. Each criterion for IV Catheters will be evaluated by at least three (3) trials (each clinical trial site will have at least three (3) clinical evaluators who will each evaluate all samples one time), in a clinical/ patient care setting. There will be approximately fourteen (14) Medical Treatment Facilities enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below:<br />1. (NPSG.07.02.01) The Safety IV Catheter tip is inspected identifying that it is free of burrs or grooves, and identifying the needle bevel is sharp so as to facilitate ease of insertion. <br />2. (NPSG.07.02.01) The Safety IV Catheter should be readily identified by visual inspection as a Safety IV Catheter and can quickly identify the manufacturer's safety feature (active or passive).<br />3. (NPSG.07.02.01) The IV catheter has the size, length and gauge clearly marked on the device or packaging.<br />4. (NPSG.07.02.01) Once the Catheter "safety" element is triggered, the safety feature locks the catheter needle safely in place during each of the trials.<br />5. (NPSG.07.02.01) The device allows for visualization of flashback in the chamber/hub. <br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. Vendors will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing must be received at the MMESO Pacific by 5:00 PM HST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</p>

Contractor must register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-1(k).

The successful Vendor to whom the purchase is made will also remove the existing safe, moving it to the VA Medical Center's Warehouse and unloading it and placing it on the loading dock.  The Vendor will then install the new Safe in the location of the old Safe to the specifications provided below. (The Warehouse location is a block from the VA Medical Center's Agent Casher's office)

The work must be performed within thirty days of the vendor receiving the Purchase Order.

Statement of Work
1. General Objectives and Requirements
 	Title of project - AGENT CASHIER SAFE 

 	Authority for the project - Financial management Revenue Follow-up Report dated August 6, 2010 from Management Quality Assurance Service, FSC, AUSTIN, TX and Station 564 Review Administrative Board of Investigation recommendations dated June 30, 2010.

 	Purpose of the project - Provide one safe to accommodate the physical storage of a cashier drawer tray and bulk currency/coins while providing separation to the access of each for 4 Cashiers with a combined total of $100K total.

 	Background - Current safe in use only has one internal combination safe for bulk currency and coinage. It also only allows for a maximum of three cashier drawers. This configuration limits one cashier to have a bulk amount and leaves the other two cashiers without adequate funds when the primary agent is not available to replenish their day's business, (which currently runs at a rate of approximately 10K - 12K daily).                   MAP & PLAN SECURITY CABINET is best type of safe configuration suited to accommodate with teller hinged lockers for drawer storage.

 	Scope and methodology - The current safe sits flatly on dunnage within the Agent Cashier Office and is not affixed by weld or bolt to any part of the internal structure. The Agent Cashier Office is located in the main corridor of a hallway that is handicap accessible. The replacement will need to be accomplished on a non business day, i.e., Sat/Sun. (when the cashier is not operating).

<DESC><p>The INL/A fixed-wing aircraft perform a variety of missions. At times the aircraft may operate from forward operating base locations under primitive conditions and at other times from international airports executing instrument approaches. The primary mission is to transport passengers and limited cargo into and out of austere and established runways located throughout the theater of operation, Iraq, in support of the DS and NEA missions. This mission requires that the aircraft have good personnel and cargo carrying capacity, long range and flight endurance. Operations are often flown in very rugged, high mountainous terrain that requires optimum take off, climb, and turn performance at high and high-density altitudes. These aircraft may serve in remote areas with few bases from which to operate aircraft.</p>
<p>Secondary missions included, but are not limited to medical evacuation, and Post directed personnel evacuation. Further, the aircraft and crews are subject to being targeted by hostile fire. These aircraft will require defensive aircrew and aircraft survivability systems to be installed like the Symetrics AN/AAR-47 missile approach warning system combined with the ALE-47 flare decoy dispensing system used on other DoS aircraft.</p>

<DESC>Prospective Offerors:
<p>The Enterprise Information Technology Acquisition Division (EAD), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), is pleased to present this solicitation for technical investigative surveillance equipment, hereafter referred to as "TechOps." This unrestricted procurement is being conducted by the EAD as a Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) in support of the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and the Federal Technical Operations Working Group (TOWG).</p>
<p>The objective of the TechOps procurement is to establish contracts to provide a full array of audio and video surveillance equipment and ancillary services in support of DHS Components and other Federal agencies having statutory law enforcement authority. These contracts will be awarded to highly qualified contractors that possess the capabilities and demonstrated experience to serve as prime contractors for this program.</p>
<p>DHS seeks the best and widest array of product offerings. Offerors may propose on either the audio or video category, or both. The Government will be conducting separate source selections for each category. <br />The Government strongly encourages teaming. Prospective offerors are encouraged to conduct a self assessment against the Technical Compliance Matrix to determine if they will be competitive as a prime contractor for the audio or video category. Prospective offerors that do not believe they will be among the most highly rated competitors should instead pursue subcontractor/teaming opportunities with other offerors. By structuring the procurement in this manner, DHS strives to provide a broad field of competitors with a variety of the very best products, and to maintain delivery order level competition for both prime and subcontractors.</p>
<p>Proposal submission instructions and evaluation criteria are provided in Attachment 1. Your proposal shall be submitted via e-mail no later than 2pm, EST, March 16, 2011 to DHSTechOps@dhs.gov. "No Bid" replies, though not required, shall also be submitted via e-mail. Questions shall be submitted via e-mail by 2pm EDT, February 24, 2011 to DHSTechOps@dhs.gov. Your hardcopy proposal shall be delivered to the address provided in Chapter E Part 2, Section 2.2.4 of Attachment 1. Due to security and screening procedures, it is recommended that offerors submit their packages early to avoid any mail screening delays. Hand deliveries are not permitted.</p>

52.0100-4094  MARKING INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL ITEMS TO INCLUDE DROP
                        SHIP AND DIRECT SHIPMENT (DMA)(OCT 2008) 

The Contractor shall attach two (2) copies of a detailed packing list with each box or container with unlike items where the full description of the contents is not authorized or cannot be shown.  Include one (1) copy of the packing list inside the box or container and attach one (1) copy of the packing list on the outside of the box or container.  The outside of the box or container must also include the complete shipping address as provided in the schedule and the Contract/Purchase/Delivery Order number located on Page 1 of this document. 

The packing list shall contain the following information:  

     (a)  Contract number/Purchase Order number or Delivery Order number
     (b)  Package number and set number (if any) of the container.  
     (c)  A list of the contents which shows the quantity by item, item description, part
number, type and size, unit of issue if other than each.  
     
NOTE!
The government WILL NOT ACCEPT items shipped without a packing list especially when the content of the package is unidentifiable; rejected items will be returned at the contractors expense.  

INCOMPLETE DELIVERIES 

Incomplete delivery refers to the incomplete shipment of a unit of issue of an individual contract line item (CLIN).   Such Incomplete, or fragmented delivery of any part of a CLIN is not authorized and will not be accepted.   Each item (CLIN), including all components and sub-items, is to be delivered complete. Where sub-line items are reflected as component parts of an item, all sub-line items must be delivered simultaneously to form the complete item.


INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS - MANDATORY:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

BRAND NAME OR EQUAL SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:The USGS is conducting research at the Fourmile Canyon Fire field site in Colorado, where extremely dry soil conditions prevail after wildfire. It is imperative for these USGS investigations of unsaturated zone hydrology to have an instrument that:
1. measures the matric potential of soil samples from field sites and the laboratory and 
2. can also be used to generate soil-water retention curves for very dry soils. 
3. The instrument must measure soil-water potential over an extremely broad range (i.e. -0.1 to at least 200 MegaPascals) to cover the soil-water regime post-wildfire. 
4. Available laboratory space also requires the instrument to be small (less than 12 x 12 x 6) so that samples can be moved to other analytical instruments in the same lab without sample loss. 
5. The soil-water retention curves are needed to estimate the initial matric potentials and soil-water contents before rainfall on burned soils that may generate catastrophic floods and debris flows in the Fourmile Canyon area, which may ultimately impact downstream areas. 6. Must run on standard 110 to 220 Volt AC power sources., 1, EA;<BR><BR><a href="https://sellers.fedbid.com/seller/fbobuyDetails.do?token=%3DoqcCG9XZCBXIAAAAAHeAAgAgTFCGg%2FFzzqQbJAAyVXBA0Or">Solicitation and Buy Attachments</a><BR><BR> ***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Buyer to respond.

The full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this internet address: https://www.acquisition.gov/far; 52.211-15 Defense Priority and Allocation Requirements (APR 2008); 52.247-34 F.O.B. Destination (NOV 1991); 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (JAN 2011)(b)(4)(6)(20-24)(26)(33-34)(37)(42) 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)<br />Closing date for receipt of quotations is 28 February 2011, 2 P.M. EST. Submit to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, SRR Product Line, Elizabeth City, NC, ATTN: Sheila G. Midgette, (252) 335-6943, Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil.. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.

<DESC>1)"How deep, along the Y or X, do the manipulators need to extend to reach all points on their worst curved part". Imagine attempting to TT half a sphere standing on end. This would require the manipulator to be at least as long as the radius of the sphere.
<p>Answer: Some parts may have a 24" Radius or internal cavity which required TTU. That would require the manipulator to extend 24" past the center line of the center of the inspection envelope. This might be considered the worst case.</p>

<SUBJECT>95--Request for Iron railed Entrance Way Gate Repair at the Arlington National Cemetery
<SOLNBR>W91WAW-11-T-0039
<RESPDATE>022211
<ARCHDATE>04232011
<CONTACT>Haydee Soto-Carreras, 703-428-0670

<a href="mailto:haydee.sotocarreras@conus.army.mil">Contracting Center of Excellence (NCR-CC)</a>
<DESC>Arlington National Cemetery requests that a Iron railed entrance way gate be removed from its bearings, and brackets, to facilitate a repair which would restore the gate to "as new" condition, and then reinstalled and checked for proper operation. The repair will include,( but not be limited to, )straightening all vertical and horizontal parts of the gate stock. This will possibly require cutting out and welding new material in sections where the metal is deformed. The deformed gate is one part of a double gate system, and must be repaired in such a way as to continue to mirror the other side of the gate. The gate is attached to a stone post by four (4), U-shaped brackets that have lost metal material due to age and wear. These brackets will need to be repaired or replaced, and new bearings installed "if needed", to return the gate to its proper non sagging aspect. While the gate is being repaired, the Contractor shall place a temporary and securable gate, (or fence), in the space the gate was removed from. The gate is composed of iron or mild steel round vertical posts, and squared stock frame, straight across the bottom of the gate, and curved at the top highest point down to the horizontal end of the top of the gate. The highest point of the gate is approximately 129' tall on one end, curved down to approximately 89' on the other end. The gate is approximately 199' wide and has a horizontal flat separator piece approximately 40" from the bottom. For a site visit or further information contact Haydee SotoCarreras at 703-428-0670. <BR><BR>Clause:<BR>52.212-4      CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS-- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2010) <BR><BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance.

The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights (1) within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. <BR><BR>(b) Assignment.

<a href="mailto:troy.robbins@us.army.mil">Rock Island Contracting Center (RI-CC)</a>
<DESC>Solicitation Number: <BR>Notice Type 	Sources Sought <BR>Synopsis:<BR>1.  Information is being collected for market research purposes and not as a request for proposal or as an obligation on part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research and will not pay for information solicited.  The purpose of this notification is to identify parties that may have interest and capability to respond to and comply with the Army's future logistics requirements as part of the emerging Enhanced Army Global Logistics Enterprise (EAGLE) contract.  Comments and questions are strictly voluntary and incorporation of comments into any future document will be at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Any information or ideas submitted to the Government may be used in formulating its acquisition strategy and any resulting solicitation.  Therefore permission to use the information for purposes of developing the acquisition strategy is inherently granted with the submission.  Proprietary data should not be submitted. <BR>2. Contract Information:  The US Army Sustainment Command (ASC) assumed responsibility for operational control (OPCON) of Directorates of Logistics (DOL) supply, maintenance, transportation support, and selected ammunition supply functions within the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, on Oct. 1, 2010. In an effort to fulfill this responsibility we are conducting market research to evaluate the ability of businesses to become PRIME contractors in support of the EAGLE contract effort.  The functional areas that are covered in this effort are Materiel Maintenance (maintenance), Retail/Wholesale Supply (supply), and Transportation Support (transportation).  These services will be solicited using the NAICS code 561210, Facilities Support Services. A stand-alone Plans and Operations functional area will not be included in the proposed EAGLE contract. In the past many installations placed separate contracts for maintenance, supply, and transportation support services.  The acquisition strategy currently under consideration by ASC, intends to centralize functional responsibility, eliminate redundancy, and maximize efficiency by combining these three functions under one contract. In other words, a single contractor at each DOL installation will be responsible for providing all required maintenance, supply, and transportation support services. The installations that have requirements other than those covered under the DOL, may or may not have one single contractor performing this work.  For example, the successful contractor for the Detroit Arsenal DOL, may or may not be the same contractor performing the other potential requirements at Warren, MI.  This is the fifth sources sought notice for the EAGLE contract.  Past sources sought notices did not clearly articulate this intention. We are seeking to ascertain industry's interest and capability in providing services at specific installations using this concept.  We are particularly interested in the capability and capacity of small businesses to perform as prime contractors providing services in all three functional areas. This information will be used to determine if a portion of the total requirement is suitable for a small business set-aside. The functional area details are as follows:<BR>a. Material Maintenance (NAICS Code 811118*): Examples of types of work are - Installation Materiel Maintenance Activity Operations, Installation Modification Work Order and Warranty program coordination, Equipment Condition Classification, Base Operation Equipment Maintenance (i.e. construction equipment, emergency equipment, etc...)Tactical Equipment Maintenance (i.e. missile, armament, combat platforms, ground support equip), Corrosion Protection Programs, Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) program, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).  <BR><BR>b. Retail/Wholesale Supply (NAICS Code 493190*): Examples of types of work are - Supply Support Activity Management (Classes of Supply include I, II, IIIP, IV, VII and IX), Central Issue Facility Operations, Individual Chemical Equipment Management Program (ICEMP), Property Accountability, Ammunition Supply Operations and Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) Management, Installation Property Book and Equipment Management, Fuel Support (CL III Bulk), Central Receiving Point, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).  <BR>c. Transportation Support  (NAICS Code 488999*): Examples of types of work are - Central Travel Office, Non-tactical Equipment Management, License Equipment Operators, Railroad Operations, Household Goods Operations, Personnel & Cargo movement (Shipping and Receiving Point), Local Drayage Operations, Movement planning and Transportation Motor Pool Operations, Unit movement planning, Arrival and Departure Control Group (ADG), Installation Transportation Office, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).  *Individual industry NAICS codes are identified as references only.  As contemplated, the EAGLE contract will be solicited under the Facilities Support Services NAICS Code 561210.<BR>3.  Response Requirements:  We are requesting responses in two formats.  <BR>a. The first is an attached spreadsheet that is intended to gather information about your current and recent past experience as well as your interest in future requirements. While the acquisition strategy under consideration DOES require prime contractors to be able to provide services covering all three functional areas, it DOES NOT require that you accept a contract/task order at every potential location. Therefore, we have estimated the make-up and magnitude of the services required at each installation to enable you to determine your specific areas of interest and demonstrate your capability. Our estimate by installation appears in Column I of the spreadsheet. It consists of an estimate of the predominant functional area required in terms of a percentage of the total requirement. The second part of the estimate consists of an estimate of whether the total dollar value of a combined contract/task order at each installation falls in a range of  $1M, >$1M $5M, >$5M $11M, >$11M $50M, or >$50M. For example Column I addressing Ft. Polk reads 50-74% (M) and >$50M.  This indicates that the predominant functional area is maintenance and that it is estimated that 50 to 74 percent of the total contract at Ft. Polk will consist of maintenance services. The remaining 26-50 percent is attributable to supply and transportation services required. The total estimated dollar value of all three functional areas is greater than $50 million. This spreadsheet may not exceed seven pages when complete. <BR>b. The second part of the requested response is a narrative explaining your understanding of the integrated nature of the requirement and addressing your estimated total capacity under the EAGLE contract.  In other words, even though you have interest and demonstrate the capability to perform at 20 different installations, you may not have the capacity to perform at all twenty simultaneously. State your capacity in terms of the number of installations you can manage simultaneously and total annual dollar value. If you have no past experience at the listed installations, please address other relevant experience that supports your ability to perform under the proposed EAGLE contract.  If the current or past experience entered on the spreadsheet indicates a capacity that is less than the estimated total capacity in your narrative response, include an explanation to describe how you intend to increase your company's total capacity.  If your company's capability does not include all three functional areas, by NAICS code, an explanation of how you will provide that functional capability is also required. You may also use this narrative to address any necessary caveats to the spreadsheet described above. Your narrative is limited to five pages using Aerial 10 Font, single spacing, on a page size of 8 1/2" x 11".  If your response does not follow the required format or exceeds maximum allowable page count it will not be considered. <BR>4.   After you have completed the spreadsheet and the narrative described above, please submit both to the EAGLE mailbox at ROCK-EAGLE@conus.army.mil.  Your response needs to be received no later than 1600 hours Central Time on 02 March 2011.  <BR>

<DESC>Torpedo Warning System (TWS) Compatible AN/SLQ-25X Torpedo Countermeasure System

Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a competitive solicitation for the design, engineering development, fabrication and test of an Engineering Development Model (EDM) for the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) Compatible AN/SLQ-25X Torpedo Countermeasure System with optional Low Rate Initial Production System production, testing and delivery and the associated program management, systems engineering, and logistic support planning requirements.  The objective of the AN/SLQ-25X program is to deploy an improved system that will provide the NIXIE acoustic and non-acoustic countermeasure capability previously fielded under AN/SLQ-25A/C with power, data and line handling interfaces to the TWS and improved Performance Monitoring/Fault Localization (PM/FL) capabilities.
  The AN/SLQ-25X will replace the AN/SLQ-25A/C System(s) on High Value Units (HVU). The AN/SLQ-25X is a digitally controlled, modular design, electro-acoustic soft-kill countermeasure decoy system.  It employs an underwater towed body acoustic projector, which is towed astern of the host ship by a fiber optic tow cable.  The system defends ships against wake homing and acoustic homing torpedoes.
The Navy plans to issue a draft of the AN/SLQ-25X Prime Item Product Functions Specification (PIPFS) and the Statement of Work (SOW) in the near future and provide a limited time for questions and comments.  Following the issuance of the draft PIPFS and SOW and the question, comment and answer period, the Navy plans to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about 04 March 2011 for industry participation.
  The RFP and the attachments listed in solicitation number N00024-10-R-6280 will be issued electronically.  Companies may download the RFP on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet site or URL: http://www.neco.navy.mil.  The solicitation and any amendments thereto will be issued electronically; subsequently the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidders mailing list.  
The Prime Item Product Functions Specification (PIPFS) and other related files will be mailed only to those companies with a validated security clearance.  Prospective offerors must submit a written request for those documents to the PCO Representative, Sharon B. Allen, at Sharon.Allen@navy.mil.
  The written request must include the company name, cage code, and the complete destination address and security point of contact (POC).  Once a prospective offerors need-to-know and security clearance is verified and approved, the company will be authorized to receive the PIPFS and other related files.  The PIPFS and other related files will be mailed to the approved requestors on the same day the RFP is issued.  The RFP and the attachments listed in solicitation number N00024-10-R-6280 will be issued electronically.  Upon approval the classified PIPFS and all unclassified related files will be mailed.  
The Government will consider all written comments and or questions.  The Government does not commit to providing a response to any comments or questions.
  All such questions should be received within ten (10) working days after release of the RFP to allow the Navy adequate time to prepare and issue responses prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals.  Any subsequent revision to any specification or solicitation requirement based on comments and or questions received remains solely at the Governments discretion.  No comments, questions, or inquiries shall be made to any Government person other than the point of contact identified in this synopsis.  
This is not an RFP.  This notice shall not be construed as a promise to contract or commitment of any kind.  This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award of a contract.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

This modification to RFI N00178-11-Q-3901 is being issued to answer questions that have been submitted.

Clarification Questions 


A.	If possible can you give more specific information about the frequency coverage desired for the system (HF to L band is pretty broad)?  Also can we bid on portions of the frequency bands or do we have to bid on the entire range?  For instance, we may have an antenna that exactly meets your requirements for a specific portion of L Band, but have nothing to cover the low end of HF  do you still want us to bid?  
A  Yes.
  Partial solutions are acceptable.  The frequency breaks between bands of interest are sensitive and cannot be provided.

B.	1. In the section referred to as /Organization Background/, question #4 requests information on the financial condition of the company. Could you address the relevant time horizon and financial statements you hope to learn more about? Should we include pro-forma statements as well or should we limit the information to more general summary?
A  General summary is sufficient.

2. In the section referred to as /Organization Background/, question #5 requests information on standard reports and their costs. What reports are we referencing? Is this in connection with internal audits, minutes from meetings of the Board of Directors, quality control documents and conformance reports, etc?
A  Reports in this case refer to technical reports (e.g.
 qualification reports, test plans and reports, certification report).

3. In the section referred to as /Production, /question 11 refers to tight schedule and requirements, could we have more information on the timeline of the project at hand?
A  Initial demonstration if funded would require delivery of initial 2 systems within 2 months on contract initiation.

4. In the section referred to as /Production, /question 12 refers to accreditations of the facility. Since we operate a limited production facility and utilize strategic partners to complete much of our production requirements, are we asked to describe our manufacturing partners facilities in terms of accreditations?
A  If the proposed solution is comprised of a prime and sub-contractor agreement(s), then accreditation of facilities that would be producing, testing, or certifying components and assemblies are required.

5.
 Is it possible to gain some insight on the scale of the projects potential manufacturing needs?
A  Total production quantities have not been established at this time.  If funded, the initial estimates are on the order of 500 complete systems over a 6 month period with potential for 1000 systems.

6. The announcement requests technologies which are TRL 8+. Does a system which is composed of antennas which are TRL 8 or TRL 9 on their own meet with the intent of your vision even though the assembled system is a lower TRL level?
A  Unless the integration of the higher-level TRL components significantly impacts their TRL, a lower TRL aggregate solution may acceptable.

7. We have several technologies that would be highly applicable to this problem however they are currently only TRL 7.
 Would you be willing to consider such technologies as part of the overall solution if we can demonstrate a clear path to get from the current state to a TRL 8?
A  Yes.  

C.	1. What is the current response date for this RFI?
A-Responses are due 28 February 2011.

On or about December 10, 2010, the Government plans to post the solicitation. No paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. A contract is expected to be awarded within 120 days of proposal submission. All dates are subject to change. <br /><br />A site visit is WILL BE HELD AT 09:00 AM LOCAL ON&nbsp;December 15, 2010.

<AWARDEE>ITT Corporation, 77 River Road, Clifton, NJ 07014 US
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Headquarters</p>
<p>2. Description of the Action Being Approved.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for a firm fixed price (FFP) contract with ITT Electronic Systems for six (6) United States Navy (USN) ALQ-214 systems for the Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures (IDECM) Program. The ALQ-214 system is currently in Full Rate Production (FRP). The proposed contract action is FRP-8.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>The IDECM ALQ-214 FRP contracts procure the ALQ-214 for the F/A-18 for the USN. In addition to the ALQ-214, ITT Electronic Systems will provide associated data in support of these items. The IDECM ALQ-214 exchanges threat information with the Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) and functions as the integrated Radio Frequency Countermeasure (RFCM) resource controller.</p>
<p>This procurement will be funded with Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 Aircraft Procurement, Navy (APN)-5 and FY 2011 APN-5 and APN-1 funds. The total estimated value of the procurement covered by this J&amp;A is $_____. The APN-5 and APN-1 contract funding profiles are shown in the table below.</p>
<p>See Appendix A for Estimated Dollar Value</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>ITT Electronic Systems is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the RFCM ALQ-214 subsystem. ITT Electronic Systems is the only qualified source with the comprehensive knowledge of the associated design requirements and tradeoffs that can perform the Government's FRP requirements for the ALQ-214 subsystem, while maintaining commonality and schedule. ITT Electronic Systems has gained a unique and in-depth knowledge of the subsystem's design and manufacturing complexities and the subsystem's operational requirements due to previous and ongoing contractual efforts.</p>
<p>ITT Electronic Systems has the facilities, skilled workforce, equipment, technical data and computer software in place to produce the FRP units within the Government's required delivery schedule to support F/A-18E/F deployments.</p>
<p>The Government received a limited ALQ-214 data package from ITT in 2007. The received technical data package documents the as-built hardware configuration current at that time, however it does not contain all of the information required to allow a firm other than ITT to produce the ALQ-214. The delivered data package does not provide the level of data necessary for competition. The necessary data and rights needed to competitively award the requirements contemplated under this contract could be purchased for approximately $_____. This amount, which includes Acceptance Test and System Integration equipment drawings, was determined via a ROM provided by ITT in their email dated 06 August 2010. This amount is economically unfeasible and data/rights would not be received until 2012 which is not in time to compete the effort contemplated under this contract.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.</p>
<p>The proposed contract was synopsized on the FEDBIZOPS website on 26 March 2010 and only ITT Electronic Systems expressed an interest in this requirement. No additional market research was conducted because it is not practicable, for the reasons discussed in paragraph 5 above, for any company other than ITT Electronic Systems to provide the required ALQ-214 systems.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.402, the Contracting Officer shall ensure that the ALQ-214 systems provided under this contract are procured at a fair and reasonable price. The Contractor will submit a formal price proposal with certified cost or pricing data and sufficient information to support the accuracy and reliability of the estimate. ITT Electronic Systems proposal will be reviewed by experienced technical analysts, cost analysts and contract specialists with the aid of necessary field pricing support by DCMA and DCAA. The Contracting Officer will utilize cost and price analysis as the basis for negotiating a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.</p>
<p>For the reasons set forth in paragraph 5, NAVAIR has no plan at this time to compete future contracts for the ALQ-214 systems covered by this J&amp;A. If another potential source emerges, NAVAIR will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible.</p>

<DESC>The United States Navy had a requirement for a cost effective aerial target system to represent subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats and air platforms. The Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) System will be used to support developmental and operational testing of naval combat systems while providing services in support of advanced fleet training.
<p>The SSAT will be a .90 to .95 Mach capable, recoverable subsonic aerial target vehicle capable of realistically representing enemy threats that operate in the high subsonic regime. The SSAT will be capable of being launched from ashore, at sea or by air (future requirement) and will be remotely controlled utilizing the System for Navy Target Control (SNTC).</p>
<p>The Navy is awarding from a competitive solicitation for the limited development and refinement of an existing target system to achieve Navy requirements to facilitate follow-on production. This late-stage Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort is envisioned to commence in the FY-11 timeframe. Follow-on production is desired in FY-13. Production is currently envisioned to cover a fifteen year period at a rate of approximately 45 or more vehicles per year.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command is awarding a cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) contract to Composite Engineering Inc (CEi) of Sacramento, CA.&nbsp; Given the development nature of the procurement where all risks are not known at the time fo award a cost type contract was deemd to be most appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Cost contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  The nature of development work often requires a cost arrangement.  In addition, appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.

<DESC>
The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) in Milwaukee, WI negotiated on a sole source basis  with B & W Contract Services as the only source able to provide the requested services to satisfy the Government needs IAW FAR 6.302-2. The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)) due to Unusual and compelling urgency. Award was made to B& W in the amount of $277,785 for the 4 month emergency maintenance and service contract.
See below attached Justification for other than full and open competition. 








































JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Temperature Controls, B&W Contract Services, Hines VA
VA69D-11-RQ-0174

1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the repair/service/maintenance of temperature controls for the entire Hines VA grounds.  This procurement will proceed on an emergency sole source basis with B&W Contract Services.

3.	A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  The VA Hospital in Hines, IL, has a requirement for a short term interim service contract to maintain and service all the temperature controls on the Hines VA campus. This service is emergency essential. The approximate cost for 4 months is $277,785.00 

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2.  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)) due to Unusual and compelling urgency.

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The VA Hospital in Hines, IL requires this service because it is emergency essential to have heat and air conditioning in all of the buildings on campus. Presently, Facilities Management Service does not have adequate staff, especially certified HVAC technicians (e.g., Associated Air Balance Council, National Environmental Balancing Bureau, Testing, Adjusting & Balancing Bureau, Honeywell controls, Metasys controls, American Automatrix controls, Alerton controls, etc.) to perform needed temperature control maintenance and services.  All of the control systems are proprietary and are inaccessible by Hines HVAC mechanics and operators.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  It is the belief of FMS that this contract will affect the safety of patients if not provided by the current contractor until a long term contract is able to be competitively awarded. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Hines FMS is diligently working with the GLAC in a combined effort to establish a sustainable contract that covers all facets of operations to ensure a technically competent contractor is found who is able to fulfill the requirements of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The complexity of the content of the SOW, obtaining an IGCE and identifying all equipment by type, location and serial number has taken longer than expected due to the sheer size and magnitude of Hines VAMC and the limited staff of FMS. The scope of work to be completed is extremely technical and has combined what used to be numerous contracts into one streamlined contract to realize a cost savings to the Government and ease of technical oversight by FMS and Contracting. 

8.	Market survey conducted:  There was no survey conducted. All pricing and facts are based on historical data, past procurements and market research going back well over ten years.
 
9.	Other facts:  B&W is a SDVOSB contractor who has been the incumbent for approximately 12 years on this contract. Due to the critical Infrastructure and the nature of work needed, the current company's knowledge of the facility and equipment makes it the only company capable of providing the required critical life support required for these services. B&W is the only company with the ability to maintain the current level of service being provided until a new permanent contract able to be competitively bid and be placed in service. It is not possible for a new company to mobilize, learn the equipment, obtain all licenses and provide emergency services due to the size and massive infrastructure of Hines VAMC.  
The establishment of this contract will ensure continuity of primary care for our veterans who are in extended care and require surgical critical care with the facility.  Any failure of a temperature control system, chillers or other HVAC system components will require the shutdown of critical patient care areas and the surgical service to go on a sustained period of by-pass.

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None sought

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge, based on historical data going back well over ten years.

<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN <br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>Agency and Contracting Activity: Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/RVE) has designed and matured the Demonstration and Science Experiments (DSX) program as an experimental space mission. This contractual activity is a repair effort for the Transmitter Amplifier and Tuning Units (TATUs) which are a mission-critical element of the Wave-Induced Precipitation of Electron Radiation (WIPER) instrument, which was damaged during Integration &amp; Testing (I&amp;T) for the DSX spacecraft. The TATU was designed and developed under subcontracting efforts by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) for the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML), and the UML delivered the TATU and other WIPER components to the prime contractor, Stanford University. The TATU with the other mission-critical components of the WIPER instrument are expected to be launched on the DSX spacecraft, and it is currently on a critical-path for Integration &amp; Testing (I&amp;T) here at AFRL. This is a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>This action is expected to be awarded as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract, with an estimated total value of $260,940.00 if all Options exercised with an expected award of March 2011 for a 8-week period of performance from award for the basic effort, and an additional 8-weeks total if all Options are exercised. This repair effort is expected to support the DSX program, which currently has an expected launch date of October 2012.</p>
<p>The TATU, which was part of the Wave-Induced Precipitation of Electron Radiation (WIPER) contract, FA8718-05-C-0027, was awarded to Leland Stanford Junior University, 651 Serra St., Stanford, CA 94305; awarded 20 May 2005; end of performance date 30 Nov 2010; issued by AFMC ESC/PKR, Electronic Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, USAF, 104 Barksdale Street, Bldg 1520, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-1806, and the previous contracting officers for this effort were Ms. Janet L. Maille (janet.maille@hanscom.af.mil), and Ms. Tammy Taylor ( tammy.taylor@hanscom.af.mil). The WIPER contract was subcontracted to University and Massachusetts Lowell (UML) who was responsible for the majority of the electrical design, but further subcontracted to SwRI for technical work associated with designing the tuner and power/logic boards within a critical portion of the WIPER payload, the TATUs. Currently, no contractual relationship currently exists between SwRI and UML and Stanford University.</p>
<p>This repair effort is necessary for the continuing highly-specialized engineering services that are required for the WIPER payload as a major spacecraft system currently under spacecraft integration for the DSX program. If these services had to be re-competed there would be substantial and unacceptable delays in the DSX program, as any new contractor would need to be trained to demonstrate knowledge and a full skill set that is necessary for the continuing efforts associated with the WIPER payload. This includes but not limited to understanding of the history of the manufacturing efforts, full operation and testing procedures and all testing results, calibration methods, calibration procedures, and calibration verification techniques used for the payload. As such, an award to any contractor other than the damaged hardware contractor, SwRI, would significantly impact the current DSX program schedule, and may cause a stop work for all WIPER activities associated with the DSX program until the new contractor could clearly demonstrate the comprehensive knowledge necessary to provide the highly specialized engineering services required for AFRL to meet its mission objectives and obligations. The resulting delay is realistically estimated at approximately six (6) months, primarily impacting integration of the WIPER payload into the DSX spacecraft and other activities leading up to launch and operations of the spacecraft. It is estimated that integration of the DSX spacecraft would suffer delays up to four (4) months as the new contractor becomes familiarized with the design, interfaces and testing history of the WIPER payload. Additionally, this delay would likely result in a loss of DSX's launch manifest and place the mission's viability at risk.</p>
<p>Award of a sole-source repair contract to SwRI will ensure that the DSX program will not incur any unacceptable delays and unacceptable risk in meeting AFRL's requirements and obligations. Therefore, this acquisition is intended for the continued performance of the required highly-specialized services by the current contractor.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>SwRI will provide highly specialized engineering services that are necessary and pertain to the failure of the TATU wiring connections and capacitors. The wiring and capacitors were originally developed and integrated by SwRI. The description of the supplies/services required to meet the agency's needs is as follows:</p>
<p>a) Remove the conathane conformal coating as need be and remove and replace all jumper wires on SN001 and SN002 (serial number 001 and serial number 002).</p>
<p>1) Use Connectronics Corp. #22 AWG FEP Wire (part No 066-062-02). The wire is TBD during the basic efforts. <br /><br />2) Install jumper wire support structure in coordination with the University of Massachusetts at Lowell (UML).</p>
<p>3) Tie down jumper wires to support as required per NASA-STD-8739.3.</p>
<p>4) Remove and replace all capacitor boards.</p>
<p>5) Verify capacitors 100% receiving inspection to include key electric characteristics.</p>
<p>b) Remove and replace relay K32 on SN002.</p>
<p>c) Perform a workmanship thermal cycle test at survival limits, (-40 &deg;C to 50 &deg;C, with &gt;2 &deg;C/min ramp rate) for 4 cycles with power off.</p>
<p>d) Support UML at SwRI in performing functionality testing of the TATUs as required.<br />e) Provide priced Options(s) to perform proto-qualification Vibration Testing on both TATUs and the TCU, 3 axis each as outlined below per paragraph h.</p>
<p>f) Provide priced Options(s) to perform proto-qualification Shock Testing on both TATUs and the TCU, 3 axis each as outlined below per paragraph h.</p>
<p>g) Ship back to AFRL via Fedex custom critical.</p>
<p>h) Option efforts for repair, rework, re-design, and testing of the TATUs along with the TCU are listed below.</p>
<p>1) OPTION 1: Provide a design for and an analysis of a TATU wire support structure for securing the high voltage wires in each TATU. POP - 3 weeks.</p>
<p>2) OPTION 2: Remove and replace relays K1-K34 on both TATUs (except K32 which is task item b above). POP - 2 - weeks.</p>
<p>3) OPTION 3: Perform TCU vibration testing to proto-flight levels for 3 axis. POP - 4 days.</p>
<p>4) OPTION 4: Perform TATU vibration testing to proto-flight levels for 3 axis. POP - 4 days.</p>
<p>5) OPTION 5: Perform TCU shock testing to proto-flight levels for 3 axis. POP - 4 days.</p>
<p>6) OPTION 6: Perform TATU shock testing to proto-flight levels for 3 axis. POP - 4 days.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, (a),(2) (iii), Only One Responsible Source, for a follow-on contract for highly specialized services, when award to any other source would result in substantial unacceptable delays.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p><br />The DSX Wave-Induced Precipitation of Electron Radiation (WIPER) team consisted of Stanford University (SU), prime contractor and subcontractors Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center, University of Massachusetts, Lowell (UML) and Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). Under the Hanscom contract FA8718-05-C-0027, this team was established to design and construct the WIPER payload, providing very low frequency (VLF) radio wave receiving and transmitting capabilities to the DSX spacecraft. This capability represents the prime DSX mission.</p>
<p>The WIPER team was awarded the design/build contract via full and open competition based on their unparalleled combined experience and knowledge base in space hardware and VLF radio science. To date, SU has delivered the VLF Broad Band Receiver and UML has delivered the VLF transmitter and narrow band receiver. The latter consists of three components, a Transmission Control Unit (TCU) that has the integral narrow band receiver and two Transmitter Amplifier/Tuning Units (TATUs). UML was responsible for the majority of the electrical design; SwRI designed the network interface board within the TCU. SwRI built all the units at their manufacturing facilities in San Antonio, TX.</p>
<p>While undergoing follow-up environmental testing for the TATU flight models with the TCU engineering model (EM) at AFRL, Kirtland AFB, the AFRL Integration &amp; Test (I&amp;T) team discovered one TATU was not reaching the expected antenna voltages while running a functional test. After opening up the TATU in question (SN001), an unsupported broken wire was discovered. The wire was reattached and all unsupported wires were staked down on both TATU SN001 and SN002. After resuming vibration testing, the I&amp;T team discovered that TATU SN002 capacitance readings during the quick capacitance tests were abnormally high. After opening up the TATU SN002 again, it was discovered that one of the high voltage wires had broken loose from the printed circuit board (PCB). Additionally, the I&amp;T team had traced the anomalous capacitance reading from TATU SN002 to a relay stuck in position.</p>
<p>At this point, a question arose as to the possibility of multiple wires/relays being fatigued or broken in both TATUs and a decision to halt all environmental testing was made by the PMO. After discussions with UML and SwRI, the PMO's initial thoughts are to replace all wiring, and, if necessary the capacitor board, and all the capacitors on each TATU. UML has designed a new wire support bridge to secure all unsupported high voltage wiring, but the design in currently in its preliminary stages. UML inspected the TATU EMs and did not see any fatigue damage from the Jun 2008 qual vibe test. To continue the investigation, AFRL posed a number of questions to SwRI that only their manufacturing personnel and a review of their manufacturing records can answer. They are uniquely qualified to perform the necessary forensic evaluation of the TATUs and make a timely assessment of the damage. This assessment will drive the definition of the rework necessary to produce flight worthy hardware for the primary instrument (WIPER) on DSX.</p>
<p>SwRI is uniquely qualified to provide answers to how the TATUs were manufactured, to investigate the root cause of the failure, and highly-specialized manufacturing capabilities critical to repair the TATUs. Additionally, SwRI uses proprietary processes to develop and integrate the TATUs. Trying to obtain the appropriate permissions to share the required processes and information with another company could be very complicated, and cause the DSX program to miss the launch schedule on which it is currently manifested.</p>
<p>Without the services of SwRI, there is a high probability risk that AFRL/RV DSX program will be unable to accomplish the scientific objectives that have been reviewed and approved by the</p>
<p>AFRL/RV commander. An award to any other contractor would significantly impact discovery of the root cause of the failure and the current DSX program schedule. The TATU failure has caused a stop work for all DSX spacecraft integration and test activities until such time as the TATUs are repaired. An award to any other contractor could prevent the discovery of the root cause of the failure and would cause further delays until the new contractor can clearly demonstrate the comprehensive knowledge and capability necessary to provide the required services. The resulting delay is estimated at approximately 6 months, causing AFRL to miss delivery of a critical input to the launch vehicle integration process. Additionally, missing this delivery would likely result in a loss of DSX's launch manifest and place the mission's viability at risk.</p>
<p>Therefore, this acquisition is for the repair of the TATUs as it relates to the other WIPER components, and thus, only SwRI can provide the highly-specialized manufacturing services that are needed to meet the mission-critical schedule for the DSX program.</p>
