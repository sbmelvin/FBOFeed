<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811213 with a small business size standard of $11,000,000 in average annual revenue.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract for the of a call recording system with:<br /><br />Spok<br />6850 Versar Center, Ste 420<br />Springfield, VA 22151<br />tel 952-230-5200<br /><br />This requirement is for supply and installation of a HigherGround Calibre Call Recording Platform unique to spok's development and proprietary design, including equipment, software, installation, configuration, and three (3) years of maintenance and support. Calibre is a voice communications call recording system intended to be used by AFRL security forces.
<p>Spok, solution service provider and integrator, adopted original equipment manufacturer HigherGround's Calibre Call Recording Platform product, developed a Spok-proprietary call recording solution, and presented the solution to the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) for security testing and certification for use on Department of Defense (DoD) networks. The critical feature that distinguishes Spok's solution from its competitors is its successful application for security testing and certification by JITC and listing to the DoD Unified Capabilities Approved Product List (APL). Spok offers the only call recording solution that has received the Interoperability certification from the JITC Information Assurance test team at Fort Huachuca, AZ.</p>
<p>Market research to date has determined that no other source can meet the requirements, most notably JITC certification and APL listing.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to richard.childres@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 30 APR 2018.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulations. &nbsp;</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Centers for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Services (DLS), intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc., 710 Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, CT 06484-4750.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The estimated period of performance for this procurement is 60 days.</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this procurement is for PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. to provide relocation services for the disassembly, move and re-assembly with installation and operational verification of a custom-designed PerkinElmer Staccato automated instrumentation system. PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the PerkinElmer custom-designed PerkinElmer Staccato automated instrumentation system that we need to relocate and, therefore, are the primary provider of tools and expertise needed for this service. <br /><br /><br />The instrumentation to be moved is a custom designed and highly-complex collection of more than a dozen individual specialized pieces of equipment that requires highly-specific assembly in order to function properly. PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. is the designer and manufacturer of this custom instrument and, thus, the only service provider that is properly trained and able to disassemble, move, and reassemble the many pieces to recreate the whole, as well as verify that the equipment is operational following the reinstallation. No other providers were considered because the instrumentation to be moved is highly-complex and requires specific knowledge that only PerkinElmer has as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). They also have expert knowledge on how to repair this complex chemical analysis instrumentation. Market research was performed, however, no other vendors could perform the task because of the specialized instrumentation involved. Only PerkinElmer's service representatives possess the specific training and knowledge needed to perform this service.</p>
<p><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps.com. We will only issue a solicitation to PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. However, all responsible sources who believe they can meet these requirements, may submit their capabilities and/or qualifications to Tonya S. Justice, Contract Specialist, via email to TJustice@cdc.gov, no later than 10:00am eastern standard time on April 12, 2018. Reference solicitation number RFQ #2018-N-68097 in the subject line of the email. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and is solely in the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Approved source: Transdigm, Inc. DBA Aero Fluid Products (96124).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

<p>It is anticipated this solicitation will be posted to the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) on or after April 2018. All offerors MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). All responsible sources may submit offers which, if received in timely fashion, shall be considered.<br />DLA Troop Support has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles solicitations, use the following link to the DLA Troop Support C&amp;T Technical Data Repository area at http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Portal/sreqfrm.aspx. <br />Important Note on Foreign Content: <br />The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as "The Berry Amendment" impose restrictions on the DoD's acquisition of foreign products and services. Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014) must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.<br />-------- IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT --------<br />Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate. There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate). VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2103. After that date, no one may log on using the old user ID and password.<br />DoDI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DoD PKI identity certificates when accessing DoD information systems. The DoD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DoD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DoD and authenticate themselves to DoD Information Systems. ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DoD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DoD Information Systems.<br />The following are the three entities authorized by the DoD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br />1. IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/eca/index.html<br />2. ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br />3. VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/<br />There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can get the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to their hard drive. If one person logs on from different computers they should get the Medium Token Assurance which can be carried around like a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate. Each user will need their own (like our CAC card). Each person who needs to access the system will need one.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Availability of solicitations: FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. <br />Interested offerors can obtain a copy of the solicitation after the issuance date at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. Detailed system requirements and instructions for registration can be found on the DLA DIBBS home page accessed on https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. A few highlights of the information that will be found include: 1. On the DLA Internet Bulletin Board System (DIBBS) home page, click the VENDOR REGISTRATION link to begin the registration process. 2. In order to register for access to secure portions of DLA DIBBS, the company you are representing must already be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. 3. A Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code registration will be processed immediately. A User ID will appear on the registration screen and a password will be sent separately to the email address of the Super User. If a CAGE is already registered on DLA DIBBS, the name and email address of the Super User will be provided. The Super User should be contacted to set-up additional accounts, logons and passwords for their CAGE. DIBBS Super User * If your CAGE has already been registered on DIBBS, the name and email address of the person designated as your super user will be provided. * The representative who starts the DIBBS registration process has the option to accept their CCR registration POC as the DIBBS super user, or they can designate themselves or another person to act as the super user for the CAGE. * The super user acts as the account administrator for a CAGE. They can add up to ninety-eight additional users, provide user IDs and passwords, modify existing users, and control the login status of each user for their CAGEs through My Account (Account Maintenance.)</p>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Sole Source firm-fixed price purchase order to Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (Mesa Labs), at Lakewood Manufacturing Facility, 12100 W 6th Ave, Lakewood, CO 80228, in accordance with the authority under FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). This procurement is being conducted under simplified acquisitions procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The NAICS code is 811219 - Laboratory instrument repair and maintenance services.<br /><br />FDA's Arkansas Laboratory Microbiology Branch has a requirement for the service and maintenance of a Temperature Monitoring System manufactured and supported by Mesa Labs. Temperature is an analytical parameter that influences the outcome of many methods utilized in the regulatory laboratory. As such, it is critical that the laboratory accurately document the performance of numerous instruments in the laboratory with regard to temperature stability. Arkansas Laboratory uses the Mesa Labs (formerly TempSys) CheckPoint &copy; by Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (CheckPoint) automated wireless temperature monitoring system to meet requirements for monitoring analytical critical control points in accordance with its ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation along with AOAC International guidelines and Office of Regulatory Science (ORS) Quality Management System. Each of the temperature probes comes with a unique snap calibration connector that only fits Mesa Labs' wireless transmitters. Because this system is proprietary, all calibration of temperature probes must be performed by CheckPoint personnel. Mesa Labs is the only authorized calibration laboratory certified by the Perry Johnson Laboratory Accreditation, Inc. to provide calibration services for CheckPoint System's probes. A service agreement is required to maintain the system, troubleshoot, and provide calibrated probes annually for this wireless temperature monitoring system. No other vendor can provide this service and maintenance without voiding warranties currently being honored by Mesa Labs. For these reasons, an award to Mesa Labs is intended.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This notice is not a request for competitive quotes</span>.</strong> However, any party that believes it is capable of meeting the requirements as stated herein may submit a written response, i.e. capability statement, which clearly supports and demonstrates its ability to perform the requirements. Any response shall be received by the response date and time of this notice. Any response shall undergo review to determine if it can meet the requirements. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Background: Title 38 of the United States Code, (U.S.C.), Section 3120, is the statutory authority for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide programs of independent living services and assistance in various geographic regions of the United States.  Under this authority, the Veterans Benefit Administration may enter into contracts to provide services, to include construction, to primary residences when deemed medically necessary to maximize independence in daily living.  The American's with Disability Act (ADA) is not applicable to single residential homes.  Veterans Affairs Minimum Property Requirements (MPRs) are applicable and can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/M26   12.asp, Appendix A.

The intent of this project is to improve the Veteran's living conditions and allow access to a compliant bathroom and bedroom in accordance with the Veterans Affairs MPRs. Existing conditions in the house prevent the typical 4' x 4' roll in shower so a walk-in tub will be utilized. With it, a larger water heater will be necessary. In addition, the 5' turning radius and the 3' side or 4' front clearance for the toilet in each bath will not be attainable due to structural limitations.

This project will adapt the master bathroom, provide access to the hall bath, replace flooring in both baths with non-slip flooring material, provide additional means of ingress/egress and add storage in the kitchen area.  Work will be done keeping one bathroom fully operational at all times for the veteran.

<RESPDATE>043018
<CONTACT>Nick Griswold, Phone 8508831003, Email nicholas.griswold.2@us.af.mil
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>The Department of Defense, United States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), Air Force Test Center (AFTC), is currently conducting market research seeking capabilities statements from all potential sources, including small businesses (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned (EDWOSB), Woman-Owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) small business that are capable of providing a Spectrum Efficient Ground Receiver (SEGR).</p>
<p>The SEGR is a multi-band, multi-mode system that is compliant with Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) 106-17 Chapter 2, Appendix 2-D (Low Density Parity Check [LDPC]), Appendix 2-E (Space Time Coding [STC]) and Appendix 2-G (Data Quality Metrics and Data Quality Encapsulation [DQM, DQE]). The SEGR requires remote command/control to be accomplished by a Standard Telemetry Receiver Control Interface (STRCI) Internet Protocol (IP) network interface. The SEGR requires Adaptive Equalization for mitigation of multipath interference.</p>
<p>The Technical Requirements Document associated with this requirement is in its draft form. The Government is seeking input in the form of suggestions and comments to improve the TRD completeness and usefulness. The TRD is exclusively available to DoD contractors certified under the Defense Logistic Agencies (DLA) Joint Certification Program (JCP). Certification under the JCP establishes the eligibility of a U.S. or Canadian contractor to technical data governed, in the U.S., by DoD Directive 5230.25 and, in Canada, by the Technical Data Control Regulations (TDCR). A certification is required by U.S. or Canadian contractors that wish to obtain access to unclassified technical data disclosing militarily critical technology with military or space application that is under the control of, or in the possession of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) or the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND). Contractors must submit a DD Form 2345 to the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, along with a copy of the company's State/Provincial License, Incorporation Certificate, Sales Tax Identification Form or other documentation which verifies the legitimacy of the company.</p>
<p>For a copy of the TRD, please email the point of contact identified below with proof of certification. Address any questions, clarifications or concerns you may have via email to: Nick Griswold, nicholas.griswold.2@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, with a size standard of 1250 persons. Respondents should indicate their size in relation to this size standard and indicate socio-economic status (i.e. SB, 8(a), HUBZone, EDWOSB, WOSB, or SDVOSB). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR Clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any Government assessments. The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small business, or any particular small business program.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES STATEMENT: All interested vendors shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide the SEGR to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. The capabilities statement should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirement. The response must not exceed 10 pages.</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: nicholas.griswold.2@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "FA248718SEGR". If this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through e-mail filters at Eglin AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachment. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xsls, or .xls documents are attached to your email. All other attachments may be deleted.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency. If late information is received, it may be considered, depending on agency time constraints. All routine communications regarding the announcement should be directed to the contractual point of contact listed in this posting. The Government may or may not use any responses to this sources sought as a basis for a subsequent project/requirement. Any project/requirement developed from the sources sought responses may be the subject of a subsequent acquisition; any such subsequent acquisition will be posted in FedBizOpps.gov separately. Responses to this sources sought will not be returned. The Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to the respondents with respect to any of the information submitted under this sources sought. No requests for a bid package or solicitation will be accepted; a bid package or solicitation does not exist at this time. In order to protect the integrity of any possible future acquisition, no additional information will be provided and no appointments for presentations will be made in reference to this sources sought.</p>
<p>Only Government employees will review submitted responses to this sources sought. Respondents are advised that employees of commercial firms under contract with the Government may be used to administratively process submissions and perform other administrative duties requiring access to other contractor's proprietary information. These administrative support contractors include nondisclosure agreements prohibiting their contractor employees from disclosing any information submitted by other contractors or using such information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.</p>
<p>RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 11:00 A.M. (CST) ON 30 April 2018. Direct all questions concerning this requirement to Nick Griswold at nicholas.griswold.2@us.af.mil.</p>

<p>C.1.6. Place of Performance: The work to be performed under this contract will be performed at the Central Utility Plant (Bldg. 106) and "satellite" boiler plants in various other buildings throughout the U.S. Army Garrison ALC, 2800 Powder Mill Road; Adelphi, Maryland 20783.</p>
<p>C.1.7. Heating demands at U.S. Army Garrison ALC are satisfied via two means: a Central Heating Plant in B106 and satellite boiler plants in various other buildings. The Central Heating Plant serves Buildings 101, 103, 112, 202, 203, 204, 205, and 207, while the standalone satellite boilers listed in Technical Exhibit 1 serve buildings 108, 403, 404, 406, 504, and 601.</p>
<p>C.1.7.1 Central Heating Plant Description: The High Temperature Hot Water (HTHW) generators and all auxiliary equipment (including water makeup and feed equipment, pressure tanks, fuel oil transfer pumps, fuel oil polisher and circulating pumps) are located in the Central Utility Plant in Building 106, a 24,000 square feet building. The approximate age of the Central Heating Plant is 44 years and it comprises a combination of new and adequately maintained legacy equipment. The system was originally designed as a variable flow system operating at a temperature differential of 150 degrees Fahrenheit (F), a supply temperature of 400 degrees F supply and a 250 degrees F return. The plant currently operates at a lower supply temperature. The plant's heat sources are direct-fired, dual fuel HTHW generators. The expansion of the heated water is taken up in two (2) nitrogen expansion vessels, which simultaneously pressurize the system. The circulating pumps located in the Heating Plant distribute high temperature water to the aforementioned buildings through an underground closed loop distribution system. The campus distribution system comprises supply and return pipes under the same basic pressure. Shell and tube heat exchangers located in each building transfer heat from the primary high temperature water to the lower temperature secondary systems. Each HTHW pump has sufficient capacity to circulate the full rated flow capacity of its associated HTHW generating unit against a full system pressure drop. Pumps are single stage, end suction, centrifugal type especially designed for high temperature hot water service. These pumps circulate water through the individual generating units and the distribution system. Flow through the distribution system varies with the heating load. High temperature two-way control valves, control the flow of HTHW to the heat exchangers, as required to maintain low temperature hot water set point on the low temperature side of the heat exchangers. As the load increases, the heat exchanger control valves open and take more water. Contractor shall note that at the time of this solicitation the Fuel Oil Delivery and distribution system is being replaced. The new Fuel Oil transfer pumps, fuel oil polisher and auxiliary components will be installed and fully function by April 2018. The equipment schedules accompanying this PWS are capturing the specified equipment that will be installed, which the Contractor shall maintain as part of this contract.</p>
<p>C.1.7.2 Stand-alone Satellite Heating Boilers: The satellite boilers provide constant volume flow Low-Temperature Heating Water (LTHW) through pumped closed piping system to air handling units and other terminal equipment throughout the building or steam to heat exchangers. Hot water heating plants include gas, oil or dual-fired boilers.</p>
<p>C.1.8. Minimizing Disruption: The Contractor shall be responsible for providing services as needed to reduce disruption to mission activities.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This is an RFI released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is not seeking proposals at this time. CBP will not pay for any cost associated with responding to this RFI. All costs will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov). Interested parties are advised to monitor this website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and will not be returned.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; mso-outline-level: 1"><strong>Background: </strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: ">CBP is a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) whose mission is to prevent the illegal flow of people and goods across U.S. air, land, and sea borders while expediting the safe flow of lawful travel and commerce. As the nation's single, unified border agency, CBP's mission is vitally important for the protection of the American people and the national economy. CBP represents the first line of defense of America's borders. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt">The Tijuana River and several adjacent canyons flow north from Tijuana, Mexico, into the United States. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers routinely inspect culverts in the canyons that run under the border fence for illegal immigrants and smugglers. The culverts should be dry, except when carrying stormwater runoff, but failing wastewater infrastructure in Mexico frequently results in dry-weather flows. Several canyons have diversion structures (aka, "canyon collectors") in the U.S. that collect dry-weather flows for pumping to the International Wastewater Treatment Plant (located in the U.S.) for treatment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt">The lack of proper wastewater infrastructure in Tijuana, coupled with suspected illegal dumping, results in a high volume of recurring transboundary wastewater and hazardous flows. Known and unknown contaminants pose operational and health risks to Border Patrol Agents operating in the area. New technologies may support improved situational awareness for hazardous flows as they occur, enabling the appropriate operational, safety, and investigative response. Additionally, engineering solutions might exist to minimize the amount of wastewater that currently pools in the canyon collectors or there might be technologies that check grate and canyon collector infrastructure integrity so that agents no longer need to physically transit the collectors as part of their operational duties.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: ">Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist CBP in determining the potential level of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability of the Small Business community to fulfill this requirement.

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support is seeking sources capable of providing Boston Scientific's Neuromodulation "packages". These "packages" include an implantable device, instrumentation sets and auxiliary products that are necessary for implantation of the device. The instrumentation sets are purchased and used during the surgery. All products offered must be Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved.
<p>These "packages" must be delivered "Just-In-Time", and "Direct Vendor Delivery". Under the "Just-In-Time" delivery method, the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) calls the manufacturer's field representative who carries the products into the MTFs just-in-time for the surgery. The manufacturer's field representative may bring many sizes and types of implantable devices and auxiliary products to the surgery along with the instrumentation sets. Under the "Direct Vendor Delivery" method an order for products is placed through ECAT and the product is delivered directly to the customer via any transportation carrier. <br /><br />At the request of the MTF, the manufacturer is required to have a qualified representative on site at the MTFs within the timeframe specified by the facility necessary to meet their requirements. The manufacturer representative provides technical advice and guidance to the physician before, during and after implantation. Furthermore, technical support is available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. Boston Scientific's sales representatives are experts on their products and are a vital part in helping to ensure that the patient is getting the necessary treatment. Sources must have direct control over a sales force that is knowledgeable in Boston Scientific's Neuromodulation products.</p>
<p>This is a Request For Information (RFI) and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>The Integrative Neuroscience Branch conducts research at the cellular, molecular, and systems levels to identify the neural substrates upon which drugs of abuse act to produce long-term alterations in behavior and brain function. The Neuronal Networks Section (NNS) contributes to this research by delineating the afferent inputs, efferent targets, physiological characteristics, and behavioral functions of ventral tegmental area and dorsal raphe neurons. In order to accomplish this, they utilize classical tract tracing techniques, radioactive and nonradioactive in situ hybridization, ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, in vivo single-unit electrophysiological recordings, optogenetics, pharmacogenetics, and behavioral assays. NNS needs an optogenetically synchronized microscope system to synchronize optogenetic stimulation with deep brain calcium imaging of freely-moving animals like rats and mice. They have targets at -3.5 and -4.4 from the top of the skull and are working primarily with mice. The GCaMP6 + NpHR3.0 microscope version is needed for its compatibility with other red-shifted opsins like Chrimson and Breaches.<br /><br />See details in Purchase Description attached.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Headquarters intends to award a contract for the issuance of orders on a sole source basis under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-14-G-0004, as well as a future follow-on BOA, and potential modifications under N00019-06-C-0081 with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) in support of the CH-53K detailed Maintenance Tasks Analysis (MTA).</p>
<p>Orders are in support of the CH-53K MTAs. Orders placed under this BOA by PMA-261 will support the CH-53K program efforts related to the MTAs through Fiscal Year 2020. Actions in support of ongoing CH-53K development includes:</p>
<p>a) Performance of Analyses on Maintenance Tasks to support decisions regarding optimal maintenance task completion relative to cost, enhanced quality and repair times. The analyses will consider the resulting material availability, task frequency and the mean time to repair, as well as impact on aircraft availability when making recommendations to NAVAIR regarding maintenance task decisions. Results of these analyses will be recorded in the Logistics Product Database and provided to the Government for review/approval.<br />b) Provide apportionment of Tools, and Repairables and Consumables as they apply to each step of all maintenance tasks.</p>
<p>c) Provide Logistics support, including Repair of Repairables (ROR), Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) updates, updated spares drawings or models for repairable and consumable parts, repair of Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE) to include redesign and retest, procurement of new PSE, various logistics support analyses to include maintenance planning and maintenance task analysis, Intermediate and Depot-Level Maintenance prediction, Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) analysis, engineering support for damage limits assessment and repair procedures, Diagnostics engineering support for the Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring System (IVHMS), Integrated System Support/Integrated Computing Platform (ISS/ICP) support and updates, engineering and sustainment support to the Fleet Common Operating Environment (FCOE), concurrency of SAC and NAVAIR Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) information systems and development and delivery of Operational Test Program Sets for the Program Loading Set for Contractor Furnished Equipment.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award this procurement on a sole source basis to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (hereinafter "SAC") (Cage Code 78286) 3191 Broadbridge Ave, Stratford, CT 06614.

In addition, SAC was awarded modifications to the SDD contract for four (4) SDTA aircraft in 2013, two additional SDTA aircraft in September 2016 and award of LRIP Lot 1 AAC contract on 18 April 2016. As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the CH-53K, SAC is the only source with access to the data required to conduct the necessary analysis on OEM and supplier parts for the CH-53K. SAC may at times have a need to contract with other vendors in order to obtain necessary data and/or parts required to perform analyses, however; SAC remains the only known responsible source possessing requisite knowledge, technical expertise, special skills and technical data to successfully perform MTAs for the CH-53K helicopter. <br /><br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

<SOLNBR>SLAC_RFP_286109(JJ)
<RESPDATE>041218
<ARCHDATE>04132018
<CONTACT>JENNIFER L. JAMISON, Sr. Subcontracts Administrator, Email jjamison@slac.stanford.edu
<DESC>SLAC seeks vendors to provide the following:&nbsp;
<p>Fabrication of U.H.V. Components<br /><br />(Technical Specification is listed below. Drawings will be sent out with the formal Request for Proposal.)</p>
<p>This specification outlines the required procedures to be followed by external suppliers and/or by SLAC shops in the fabrication, assembly, and testing of components for SLAC ultra high vacuum (UHV) systems. Figure 1 illustrates the full process sequence that results in a "ready-for-installation" (RFI) assembly, but breaks the sequence into two possible levels of effort: (A) a job deliverable that requires achieving only leak tightness and UHV cleanliness, and (B) a job deliverable that requires additional processing to meet both RGA (residual gas analysis) and outgassing requirements. Most external suppliers are asked to deliver assemblies that satisfy "A" requirements, and SLAC shops complete the "B" requirements.</p>
<p>&bull;	Unless otherwise specified in the engineering drawings or by an accompanying Statement of Work (SOW), <br />&bull;	To satisfy "B" requirements, all portions of this specification apply. <br />&bull;	To satisfy "A" requirements, all portions of this specification apply, except Section 6. <br />&bull;	The SLAC Responsible Engineer is responsible for determining which sections do not apply and ensuring that the instructions are clearly stated in the engineering drawing notes. <br />&bull;	Any deviation from this specification by suppliers and/or SLAC shops must receive prior approval from the SLAC Responsible Engineer, and be recorded as a Non-Compliance Report (NCR).</p>
<p><br />1. MATERIALS SPECIFICATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS <br />A. All materials must be purchased to an ASTM, AMS or other SLAC approved specification as called for on the drawing or purchase order. <br />B. Original mill source certifications must be obtained for all metals. <br />C. As a minimum, certifications must include the heat number and the results of actual chemical analysis and mechanical properties tests. <br />D. Copies of certifications must accompany delivery of the finished parts to SLAC. <br />E. Ordinary "Certs" or those with minimum or typical chemistries or properties are not acceptable.</p>
<p>2. FABRICATION <br />A. Flanges: <br />1. The knife-edge sealing surface of all UHV flanges must be examined before machining. <br />2. Vendor must reject any flange having a knife-edge defect. <br />3. To avoid damage, the knife-edge must be protected at all times during handling and machining. <br />4. Methods which permit machining without removal of the protection should be used. <br />5. Flanges received with knife-edge defects after machining will be rejected by SLAC. <br />6. The specification for stainless steel knife-edge flanges is SLAC Doc. No. PS-202-631-04.</p>
<p>B. Lubricants: <br />1. Cutting fluids and other fabrication lubricants which contain more than 0.005% (50 ppm) sulfur are prohibited unless an exemption is specifically obtained from the SLAC Responsible Engineer. <br />2. SLAC Klystron Department Document No. SC-700-866-47 contains a list of approved lubricants.</p>
<p>C. Machining: <br />1. Transition Materials: <br />a. Machining aluminum-to-stainless steel transition material requires: <br />i. Light cuts to avoid excessive stress on bonded junction <br />ii. Adequate cooling - part temperature must not exceed 150&deg;F <br />iii. An identification number if transition material is serialized. <br />b. Pre-testing is required for bond widths deviating from requirements in Section 2 of SLAC Doc. No. PS-202-631-05, "Recommended Practice - Transition Material." The pre-testing process is described in Section 8 of the same reference. Vendor shall supply pre-test results to the SLAC Responsible Engineer. <br />2. Grinding, Sanding, Polishing and De-Burring: <br />a. The use of sanding discs, grinding wheels or abrasives is prohibited unless specifically called for. <br />b. Acceptable techniques and materials for de-burring and polishing are given in SLAC Doc. No. SC-700-866-49.</p>
<p>D. Cleaning (post-machining): <br />1. Parts may be wiped down to remove excess lubricants. <br />2. Vapor degreasing of parts by vendor may be applied only if the degreaser is charged with fresh degreasing fluid and is maintained per its manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
<p>E. Welding. <br />1. Parts to be welded must be cleaned prior to welding. <br />i. Pre-welding cleaning process and sequence can impact the final UHV cleanliness levels. <br />ii. Vendor-selected pre-weld cleaning process must be compatible with part's or assembly's final UHV requirements at ready-for-install. <br />iii. Vendors must provide pre-welding cleaning sequence and process to SLAC engineering for review as part of the vendor selection process. <br />iv. The selected vendor is expected to provide travelers as proof of compliance to the vendor's own approved process. <br />v. Parts/assemblies with embedded contaminants that compromise UHV cleanliness requirements will be rejected by SLAC. <br />2. All welds must be Gas Tungsten Arc process (GTAW) or a process that is approved by SLAC Responsible Engineer.</p>
<p>F. High Temperature Furnaces: <br />1. See Section 5, Clean Firing, below for guidelines. <br />2. Vacuum furnaces may be used with prior approval of the SLAC Responsible Engineer. <br />3. Process requirements are specified on the drawing. <br />G. Parts Inspection. <br />1. Parts must be inspected for conformance to the drawing dimensions and other requirements. <br />2. Copies of inspection reports must be made available. <br />H. EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining). <br />1. EDM is permitted if part is labelled as EDM-machined and if EDM-residue is removed by etching. Vendor's etch process must be approved by SLAC Responsible Engineer.</p>
<p>3. UHV STANDARDS</p>
<p>A. Cleaning processes that can achieve UHV standards <br />1. For any vendor-selected cleaning process, the point of application in the fabrication sequence shown in Figure 1 matters. <br />2. Vendor-selected UHV cleaning process and fabrication sequence must be documented, reviewed, and approved by SLAC prior to issuance of a purchase order. <br />3. SLAC will verify the documented processes by evaluating the vendor's first article. <br />4. SLAC will monitor the vendor for conformance to the approved vendor process. <br />5. The selected vendor is expected to provide travelers as proof of compliance to the vendor's own approved processes. <br />6. Some cleaning processes may compromise the integrity of vacuum flange knife edges (see Section 2A) or the integrity of vacuum bellows. The vendor must provide to SLAC for approval the intended manufacturing sequences of assemblies containing these kinds of parts. <br />7. Possible UHV cleaning processes used singly or in combination, include but are not limited to: <br />i. Chemical cleaning <br />ii. Passivation <br />iii. Electro-polishing <br />iv. Vacuum firing <br />v. Aqueous solution ("wet") cleaning with air dry <br />vi. Vacuum bake</p>
<p>B. UHV Handling and Packaging <br />1. Parts that have been chemically cleaned, furnace fired, etc., must not be touched with bare hands. <br />2. Parts must be handled only with SLAC approved clean room gloves that are powder-free Latex or powder-free Nitrile. <br />3. All handling and assembly of cleaned parts must take place only in a Class 100,000 or better Clean Room, unless the SLAC Responsible Engineer has specified that the part or assembly will be subjected to further wet cleaning processing. <br />4. For parts/assemblies to meet leak test and UHV cleanliness requirements ("A" in Figure 1): <br />i. For storage or transit, wrap parts with U.H.V. aluminum foil per SLAC specification PS-202-100-01. <br />ii. Using clean room gloves, parts must then be placed in clean, covered containers sealed with 3M #471 vinyl tape or equivalent. Very large parts such as long tubes, or aluminum extrusions may be wrapped in "blue line" neutral kraft paper after first sealing all openings with the above approved U.H.V. aluminum foil. <br />5. For parts/assemblies that fully meet RGA and outgassing requirements ("B" in Figure 1): <br />i. Part/assembly openings except one blanked off, and the part/assembly must be vented with boiled off nitrogen <br />ii. Part/assembly must be backfilled with boiled-off nitrogen, and then the single remaining opening sealed by pinch-off. <br />iii. For transit and storage, wrap sealed assembly in two layers all-virgin polyethylene Type II, Class 2 per Military Specification A-A-3174.</p>
<p>C. "DO NOT OPEN" Labels. <br />1. Vendors fabricating parts to UHV standards must affix several "DO NOT OPEN" labels to all shipping containers. See reduced size illustration below.</p>
<p>4. LEAK TESTING <br />A. This section applies to any part or assembly that forms a vacuum barrier or wall. <br />B. Leak test per "SLAC Leak Test and Mechanical Integrity Standard," SLAC-I-141-201-004-00. Reject any part which, when probed with helium for at least one minute, results in a leak greater than 2x10-10 std cc/sec, unless otherwise specified on the drawing. <br />C. Any deviation from this leak test specification by suppliers and/or SLAC shops must receive prior approval from the SLAC Responsible Engineer, and be recorded as a Non-Compliance Report (NCR).</p>
<p>5. CLEAN FIRING <br />A. If contaminated during manufacturing or leak testing, UHV ceramic or metal parts, except stainless steel parts (see Sections 5.C to 5.F below), may be clean fired with hydrogen or inert gas. <br />B. If the brazing process permits, ceramic-to-metal parts can be clean fired in dry hydrogen at 550oC for a minimum of 15 minutes. Furnace cool in hydrogen to 100oC or less. Purge with dry nitrogen (boiled off from liquid nitrogen or dry nitrogen with purity equivalent to gas boiled off from liquid nitrogen ) and continue furnace cooling to less that 70o C prior to opening furnace. Handle per Section 3B above. In case the metal is stainless steel, see below and consult with the SLAC Responsible Engineer <br />C. Pre-firing of stainless steel bellow in hydrogen atmosphere is not permitted <br />D. 304L Stainless steel must not be vacuum fired therefore it must not be clean fired with hydrogen but just with inert gases. <br />E. 316L and 316LN Stainless Steel that contain Boron in more than 9 ppm, must not be vacuum fired therefore they must not be clean fired with hydrogen but just with inert gases.</p>
<p><br />6. PROCESSING ASSEMBLIES FOR READY-FOR-INSTALLATION <br />A. This section addresses the steps in Figure 1 that are required to meet Ready-for-Installation (RFI) requirements. The directions in this section are applied by a vendor ONLY IF specified in the vendor statement of work or PO. <br />B. Part/assembly is assumed to have been processed per this specification's requirements to meet leak test and basic UHV cleanliness requirements ("A" in Figure 1). <br />C. Applying UHV handling requirements, the part/assembly is prepared for and then vacuum baked at a temperature and for a time specified by SLAC engineering. The complexity of the part/assembly may require multiple cleaning/verification steps. <br />D. A RGA (Residual Gas Analysis) scan is taken of the part/assembly at 150&deg;C (see Appendix A.2 for acceptance requirements) <br />E. The part/assembly's outgassing is measured (see Appendix A.3 for acceptance requirements). <br />F. Part/assembly is then prepared for transport and storage per Section 3.</p>

Background/Introduction.  The Community Nursing Home (CNH) program is a key component of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) continuum of care.  The Contractor agrees to provide in accordance with the terms and conditions stated herein to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Alexandria Health Care System, in Alexandria, LA at the prices specified in the section titled Schedule of Items of this IDC.    Nursing home facilities in the CNH program shall cooperate with VA staff in referral of appropriate veterans for care and accept veterans of which they have the capability/capacity to care.    The term,  facilities,  shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas. VA shall have the right to inspect the CNH and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.  

Requirements
 
1. General. Nursing home facilities in the CNH program shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  All nursing home facilities in VA s CNH program must have current Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification (Medicare and/or Medicaid) and a State nursing home license.  VA developed quality of care standards utilizing CMS inspection criteria that are followed by VA in its selection of nursing homes which includes exclusionary criteria on which the CNH is evaluated.  See VHA Handbook 1143.2,  VHA Community Nursing Home Oversight Procedures (June 4, 2004) a copy of which is available at:  http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?pub=2. VA often has a particular need for specialty care services in the CNH program. The VA requires CNHs to have bed capacity to ensure their ability to take referrals when requested.  The CNH also must be able to accept VA referrals in a timely fashion (ideally within 24 hours of request). Provider visits will be available at the rate of one (1) visit per month. Laboratory, x-ray, and other special services will be available to VA patients as needed.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA-authorized level of care, without extra charge.  Duly authorized representatives of VA will provide quality oversight visits to veterans placed to assure continuity of care and to assist in the veterans  transition back into the community.  These visits do not substitute nor relieve the CNH in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.  The per diem rate(s) established in this IDC will include the cost of primary medical care, one (1) provider visit per month and needed consultation, drugs and routine supplies, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted (see Schedule of Items in this IDC for details regarding per diem rates and coverage).  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.

2. Termination of Services. VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the CNH at any time when it is determined to be in the best interest of VA or the patients without additional costs to the Government.

3.  VA Authorizations.  Authorization for nursing home care will be submitted on VA Form 10-7078,  Authorization and Invoice for Medical and Hospital Services.   Each authorization validity period will be noted on the VA Form 10-7078 with a beginning and end date.  Any extension to the original authorization validity period, regardless of the number of days, requires a new VA Form 10-7078.

4. Medicaid-Based Rates.  The current State Medicaid rates may be used as a basis for determination of VA rates.  The VA rate will include medical care, routine medications, laboratory, x-ray, therapy (ies), and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically exempted.  VA will contract for appropriate Medicaid categories of care using Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV) as a guide.  As with Medicare, a description of the RUG-IV systems can be found in 42 CFR Parts 409, et al.  

5. Primary Medical Coverage.  The assigned CNH provider is the primary medical provider during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the CNH.  The CNH provider is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Provider visits will be according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines.  The assigned nursing home provider will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care; arranging easy access to VA staff for consultation; providing timely response to calls and arranging for timely provider back-up according to OBRA guidelines (42 CFR 483.40, OBRA Guidelines).

6.  Rehabilitation Criteria.     All therapy provided under this IDC will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  Therapy may require pre-approval by VA before services are provided.   Medical Restorative criteria will be used for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Therapy must be skilled, relate to safety and be restorative according to Medicare criteria.  

Description of Rehabilitative Therapy. The concept of rehabilitative therapy includes recovery or improvement in function and, when possible, restoration to a previous level of health and well-being. Therefore, evaluation, re-evaluation and assessment documented in the Progress Report should describe objective measurements which, when compared, show improvements in function, or decrease in severity, or justification for an optimistic outlook to justify continued treatment.  Covered therapy services shall be rehabilitative therapy services unless they meet the criteria for maintenance therapy requiring the skills of a therapist.  

Evaluations/re-evaluations should consider the following:  Establishment of treatment goals specific to the patient s disability or dysfunction and designed to specifically address each problem identified in the evaluation; design of a plan of care addressing the patient s disorder, including establishment of procedures to obtain goals, determining the frequency and intensity of treatment; continued assessment and analysis during implementation of the services at regular intervals; instruction leading to establishment of compensatory skills; selection of devices to replace or augment a function (e.g., for use as an alternative communication system and short-term training on use of the device or system); and patient and family training to augment rehabilitative treatment or establish a maintenance program. Education of staff and family should be ongoing.

7. Emergency Care; Financial Responsibility; Advanced Directives. In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident.  Advance directives or living wills shall be adhered to according to CNH physician s orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VA Health Care System (VAHCS) is contacted by the private hospital provider within 72-hours of admission on the first business day following a weekend or holiday.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care.

8. HIPAA Compliance.  HIPAA compliance is required.  The Contractor must adhere to the 
provisions of Public Law 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
of 1996 and the National Standards to Protect the Privacy and Security of Protected Health
Information (PHI).  As required by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) has promulgated rules governing the security and use and disclosure of protected health
information by covered entities, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In accordance
with HIPAA, the Contractor may be required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
with VA, but VACO has recognized CNH Facilities as an entity that does not require a BAA as long as they are conducting health care on VA s behalf.  The CNH care program qualifies as a medical service, so no BAA is required.

9.  State Licensure; Access to CNH Quality of Care Reports (QASP Indicator #1).  The CNH must maintain a current and unrestricted state license to operate as a skilled nursing facility.  Changes in the status of the licensure will be immediately reported to the Alexandria VA Home and Community Care Department at 318-466-2431.  VA will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this IDC, through one or any combination of the following methods:  reviews of State agencies reports; on-site inspection of the CNH by VA staff; and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients. The CNH shall provide VA with copies of all State agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA s quality improvement or quality assurance program functions relating to this IDC, including VA s on-site inspection and monitoring.  The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the Contractor s reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.

10. Corrective Action Plan (QASP Indicator #2).  The CNH will cooperate with timely development of Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) related to identified deficiencies and related to State, Federal or VA surveys.  The CNH will develop in the time period specified by VA timely and appropriate CAPs for VA surveys or investigation of complaints related to quality of care or sentinel events.  The CNH will also supply related documents or data as specified by VA.  The CAPs will include but are not limited to the following criteria and shall:
 
contain elements detailing how the CNH will correct the deficiency as it relates to the individual;
indicate how the CNH will act to protect residents in similar situations;
Include the measures the CNH will take or systems that will be altered to ensure that the problem will not recur.  The CNH must look at the system and determine if a change to the existing system will work, if a new system is necessary, or if a system does not exist and must be developed;
Indicate how the CNH plans to monitor performance to make sure that solutions are permanent.  The CNH must develop a quality assurance tool for ensuring that correction is achieved and sustained.  This tool must be implemented.  Failure to implement a quality assurance tool to sustain compliance will reflect that the CNH has an ineffective quality assurance system; and
Provide dates when corrective action will be completed.

11.  Life Safety Code. The CNH s building shall conform to the most recent standards of the Life Safety Code (National Fire Protection Association Standard #101) in effect on the date of the IDC award and compliance with all applicable Federal, State and local regulations. The administrator of the CNH is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer in writing at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility which were in existence at the time this IDC became effective.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Safety Manager responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of the CNH and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval or disapproval of the CNH to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes.  These changes may include but are not limited to: 

Interior changes requiring VA approval. Some examples of facility changes that require the VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows:   interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen or trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls or doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems;

Automatic sprinkler system.  All VA contracted CNH facilities are to be fully-equipped with a fully-automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association s (NFPA) standards and be 100% sprinkler;

Natural disasters.  In the event of a natural disaster (flood, tornado, etc.), the CNH shall communicate all action plans to VA.  The action plans will at a minimum identify temporary transfers of location, dates, and names of veterans transferred; and

Major construction; additions; and renovations. Major construction including building additions or other renovations which may affect physical plant integrity; SHALL MEET latest NFPA 101 Life/Safety Code requirements as well as any additional VA CNH construction standards in place at time of renovation or alteration.  

12. Acceptable Safety and Sanitation Practices.  Acceptable safety and sanitation practices shall be observed throughout the facility.  The CNH will address employee and patient safety practices through staff orientation, training and adherence to related policy or procedures to provide a safe and clean environment.

13.  Re-admission to the VA Hospital and Emergency Care; Notification of Death of Veterans; CNH Responsibility to Veteran s Belongings or Personal Effects (QASP Indicator #3).  VA beneficiaries who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  

When such an admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72-ours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility and notice of any veteran death within 24-hours or immediately the first business day after a weekend or holiday.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, readmission to a VA Medical Center may be accomplished as soon as the patient s condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to a VA Medical Center.  

In the event of a death of any veteran, the Contractor agrees to notify VA immediately of the death.  In the event a death of a VA beneficiary while receiving nursing home care under this IDC, the CNH will promptly notify the VA facility which authorized admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient s personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the CNH shall be delivered by the CNH to the person(s) entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the CNH for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs or next of kin capable of inheriting.  

When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases, the CNH will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.  CMS regulations require retention of records for five (5) years when there is no requirement in State law.

14. Leave of Absence (LOA)   Bed-Hold Statement. For re-hospitalizations or therapeutic passes, VA will pay a bed hold.  Therapeutic passes will be authorized by the CNH staff based on individual patient needs, but are generally limited to two (2) times per month and should be pre-approved.  VA will cover bed holds based on the following plan: 

 The host VA medical center will select one of the following options:
 
2 days/episode, pre-approved by VA when in the best interest of the Veteran and VA.Â  Exceptions approved at VAMC level;

Bed-hold will begin the date the resident leaves the CNH and full per diem will resume on the date of readmission to the CNH.  Absences of fifteen (15) consecutive calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility require a new authorization agreement.  The nursing home is responsible to notify the family if a bed hold is required for a longer period.  The family would then make arrangements with the home to hold the bed.  

15. Reportable Events (QASP Indicator #4). VA requires CNHs to report to the CNH Coordinator at VA any of the following events within 24-hours or immediately the first business day after a weekend or holiday:  
Sentinel events; 
When there is a change of ownership of the CNH; 
When there is a change of nursing home administrator or Director of Nursing/Director of Nursing Service; 
substantiated allegations of mistreatment, neglect, abuse or misappropriation of CNH veterans or property; 
Elopements of CNH veterans pursuant to state regulations; 
Infectious outbreaks; 
Resident to resident or resident to staff altercations involving a CNH veteran resulting in any injury that is other than minor; 
Copies of annual surveys or substantiated complaint investigations conducted by a State oversight agency; and 
Adverse events.  Reporting shall include date of occurrence and patient disposition and outcome.  

A sentinel event may include, but is not limited to the following:  
A fall resulting in death or injury; 
Elopement resulting in a missing patient; 
Patient abuse confirmed or under suspicion; 
A medication error resulting in patient illness or injury; 
Death or patient injury related to restraint (including side rails) use; or 
Death related to an unconfirmed or suspicious cause.   

When an adverse event occurs involving a CNH Veteran which is not determined to be a Sentinel Event (but that the State requires that the occurrence be reported to the State), such event is also to be reported to VA s CNH program office.  Some adverse events, such as minor medication errors without catastrophic outcomes, are managed by the CNH in the context of their quality improvement programs.  It is not necessary for nursing homes to report such incidents to the CNH program office.

16.  VA Actions Regarding Serious Quality of Care Deficiencies.  In cases of serious deficiencies affecting the health or safety of veterans or in cases of continued uncorrected deficiencies, VA will take one or more of the following actions in accordance with the terms and clauses of the IDC and applicable procurement regulations:

Increase VA staffing monitoring until the State survey agency clears the deficiency;
Suspend placement of veterans in the CNH;
Remove or transfer veterans under the IDC from the subject CNH;
Not renew the IDC; and/or
Terminate the IDC.
 
17.  VA Staff Access to CNH Records (QASP Indicator #5).  All medical records concerning the veteran s care in the CNH will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or the death of a patient, medical records will be retained by the CNH for a period of at least five (5) years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Â§ 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following:

VAHCS Referral Package to the CNH: 

1.  Copy of Physician Orders for Nursing Home Care; CPRS Notes; Discharge Summary                    including History & Physical information with Medication List; Rehabilitation                   Progress Notes; and Veteran Demographic Record which includes next of kin information. 

         2.  Copy of Authorization Agreement (VAF 10-7078).

b. Nursing Home Clinical Record:  The CNH must maintain clinical records on each veteran in accordance with accepted professional standards and practice. The clinical record must be:  complete, accurately documented, readily accessible, systematically organized, and legible.  Clinical records must contain at a minimum: 

Sufficient information to identify the resident; 
A record of the veteran s assessments, including those assessments performed by services under the IDC with the CNH; 
The plan of care and services including medication administration, provided by CNH staff and services provided under the IDC with the CNH; 
Interdisciplinary progress notes to include effect of care provided, veterans  response to treatment, change in condition, and changes in treatment; 
Medical practitioner orders which are signed and dated; 
Allergies; 
Person to contact in an emergency situation; 
Name of attending medical practitioner; and 
Advanced directives if available. 

c. Clinical Record Safeguards: The CNH must safeguard clinical record information against loss, destruction, or unauthorized use. If the CNH maintains a veteran s record by computer, electronic signatures are acceptable.  If attestation is done on computer records, safeguards to prevent unauthorized access and to provide for reconstruction of information must be in place.

18.  Specialty Services.  The CNH will assume responsibility for arranging specialty care for veterans (e.g., dental care, podiatry and ophthalmology).


19.  VA Health Care System Consultation/Resources. 

 (a)  Telephone Care Communications Systems (TCCS):  For urgent same-day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 318-466-2431/2265 between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same-day appointment is anticipated; please call as early as possible.

 (b)  Admissions Conference Call Systems phone number Phone #:318-466-2431/2265
For non-emergency consultation or /evaluation for admission to the Alexandria VA Health Care System (after initial evaluation or intervention by the nursing home physician).

 (c)  After hours, weekends and holidays:  For urgent referrals or consultation contact the
Admission Conference Call System number 318-466-4402. (Urgent Care), still leave message at the above phone number.

 (d)  Transportation:  Necessary transportation to and from the VA hospital for clinics, evaluation or hospitalization will be arranged by individual nursing homes and paid by the VA hospital for CNH patients when requested.  For Clinic appointments, a consult is needed and sent to CNH for referral.

20. Charitable Contributions. The CNH will not solicit contributions, donations, or gifts from patients or family members.  Note:  Established charitable fundraising activities of a CNH fall outside the scope of this language.

21.  CNH Billing (QASP Indicator #6).  Invoices for board, care and ancillary services shall be submitted promptly to the authorizing facility by the 15th calendar day following the end of the month in which services were rendered.  The CNH will promptly notify the VA CNH Coordinator regarding any change in Veteran status:  discharge, transfer, against medical advice (AMA), hospitalization, death and/or any changes in payer source and any ability to complete timely billing.  All invoices must include the full name and address of the CNH and shall reflect the patient s name, social security number, number of days billed, RUG category (ies), and agreed upon RUG rate (s). Failure to include this information may result in delayed payment.  

Pre-approves services billed by CMS procedures or CPT codes:  All services which are pre-approved by VA as additional to the all-inclusive per diem rate must be billed according to CMS procedures or CPT codes.  The CNH will be reimbursed based on local guidelines and VA pricing schedules.

High cost drugs: All requests for additional reimbursement for high cost drugs and corresponding billing are due as soon as possible, but no later than 90 calendar days after use of products. 

Invoices:  Corrected invoices must be submitted for additional payment of any ancillary costs or changes to the original billing.  All corrected invoices must include all items that are affected by the change.

22.  Minimum Quantities; VA Payment.   It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this IDC.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this IDC, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the CNH as outlined in this IDC.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the CNH but not the day the recipient leaves a CNH unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one (1) day.

23.  VA Payments.   Payments made by VA under any contract pursuant to this IDC, constitute the total cost of nursing home care.  No additional charges will be billed to Medicare (with the exception of hospice), Medicaid, or private insurance, the beneficiary or his/her family, either by the CNH or any third party furnishing services or supplies required for such care, unless and until specific prior authorization in writing is obtained from the VA facility authorizing placement.  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) will not be billed for uncovered services or costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double-billing and Federal fraud.

Vendors who bill electronically using the HIPAA-compliant claims transactions must submit claims through the VA clearinghouse, Emdeon, using payer ID number 12115 for medical claims.

Vendors who are not able to use the HIPAA-compliant transactions are not required to do so.  Supporting information for monthly invoices will be mailed to:

Background/Introduction.  The Community Nursing Home (CNH) program is a key component of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) continuum of care.  The Contractor agrees to provide in accordance with the terms and conditions stated herein to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Alexandria Health Care System, in Alexandria, LA at the prices specified in the section titled Schedule of Items of this IDC.    Nursing home facilities in the CNH program shall cooperate with VA staff in referral of appropriate veterans for care and accept veterans of which they have the capability/capacity to care.    The term,  facilities,  shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas. VA shall have the right to inspect the CNH and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.  

Requirements
 
1. General. Nursing home facilities in the CNH program shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  All nursing home facilities in VA s CNH program must have current Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification (Medicare and/or Medicaid) and a State nursing home license.  VA developed quality of care standards utilizing CMS inspection criteria that are followed by VA in its selection of nursing homes which includes exclusionary criteria on which the CNH is evaluated.  See VHA Handbook 1143.2,  VHA Community Nursing Home Oversight Procedures (June 4, 2004) a copy of which is available at:  http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?pub=2. VA often has a particular need for specialty care services in the CNH program. The VA requires CNHs to have bed capacity to ensure their ability to take referrals when requested.  The CNH also must be able to accept VA referrals in a timely fashion (ideally within 24 hours of request). Provider visits will be available at the rate of one (1) visit per month. Laboratory, x-ray, and other special services will be available to VA patients as needed.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA-authorized level of care, without extra charge.  Duly authorized representatives of VA will provide quality oversight visits to veterans placed to assure continuity of care and to assist in the veterans  transition back into the community.  These visits do not substitute nor relieve the CNH in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.  The per diem rate(s) established in this IDC will include the cost of primary medical care, one (1) provider visit per month and needed consultation, drugs and routine supplies, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted (see Schedule of Items in this IDC for details regarding per diem rates and coverage).  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.

2. Termination of Services. VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the CNH at any time when it is determined to be in the best interest of VA or the patients without additional costs to the Government.

3.  VA Authorizations.  Authorization for nursing home care will be submitted on VA Form 10-7078,  Authorization and Invoice for Medical and Hospital Services.   Each authorization validity period will be noted on the VA Form 10-7078 with a beginning and end date.  Any extension to the original authorization validity period, regardless of the number of days, requires a new VA Form 10-7078.

4. Medicaid-Based Rates.  The current State Medicaid rates may be used as a basis for determination of VA rates.  The VA rate will include medical care, routine medications, laboratory, x-ray, therapy (ies), and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically exempted.  VA will contract for appropriate Medicaid categories of care using Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV) as a guide.  As with Medicare, a description of the RUG-IV systems can be found in 42 CFR Parts 409, et al.  

5. Primary Medical Coverage.  The assigned CNH provider is the primary medical provider during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the CNH.  The CNH provider is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Provider visits will be according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines.  The assigned nursing home provider will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care; arranging easy access to VA staff for consultation; providing timely response to calls and arranging for timely provider back-up according to OBRA guidelines (42 CFR 483.40, OBRA Guidelines).

6.  Rehabilitation Criteria.     All therapy provided under this IDC will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  Therapy may require pre-approval by VA before services are provided.   Medical Restorative criteria will be used for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Therapy must be skilled, relate to safety and be restorative according to Medicare criteria.  

Description of Rehabilitative Therapy. The concept of rehabilitative therapy includes recovery or improvement in function and, when possible, restoration to a previous level of health and well-being. Therefore, evaluation, re-evaluation and assessment documented in the Progress Report should describe objective measurements which, when compared, show improvements in function, or decrease in severity, or justification for an optimistic outlook to justify continued treatment.  Covered therapy services shall be rehabilitative therapy services unless they meet the criteria for maintenance therapy requiring the skills of a therapist.  

Evaluations/re-evaluations should consider the following:  Establishment of treatment goals specific to the patient s disability or dysfunction and designed to specifically address each problem identified in the evaluation; design of a plan of care addressing the patient s disorder, including establishment of procedures to obtain goals, determining the frequency and intensity of treatment; continued assessment and analysis during implementation of the services at regular intervals; instruction leading to establishment of compensatory skills; selection of devices to replace or augment a function (e.g., for use as an alternative communication system and short-term training on use of the device or system); and patient and family training to augment rehabilitative treatment or establish a maintenance program. Education of staff and family should be ongoing.

7. Emergency Care; Financial Responsibility; Advanced Directives. In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident.  Advance directives or living wills shall be adhered to according to CNH physician s orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VA Health Care System (VAHCS) is contacted by the private hospital provider within 72-hours of admission on the first business day following a weekend or holiday.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care.

8. HIPAA Compliance.  HIPAA compliance is required.  The Contractor must adhere to the 
provisions of Public Law 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
of 1996 and the National Standards to Protect the Privacy and Security of Protected Health
Information (PHI).  As required by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) has promulgated rules governing the security and use and disclosure of protected health
information by covered entities, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In accordance
with HIPAA, the Contractor may be required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
with VA, but VACO has recognized CNH Facilities as an entity that does not require a BAA as long as they are conducting health care on VA s behalf.  The CNH care program qualifies as a medical service, so no BAA is required.

9.  State Licensure; Access to CNH Quality of Care Reports (QASP Indicator #1).  The CNH must maintain a current and unrestricted state license to operate as a skilled nursing facility.  Changes in the status of the licensure will be immediately reported to the Alexandria VA Home and Community Care Department at 318-466-2431.  VA will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this IDC, through one or any combination of the following methods:  reviews of State agencies reports; on-site inspection of the CNH by VA staff; and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients. The CNH shall provide VA with copies of all State agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA s quality improvement or quality assurance program functions relating to this IDC, including VA s on-site inspection and monitoring.  The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the Contractor s reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.

10. Corrective Action Plan (QASP Indicator #2).  The CNH will cooperate with timely development of Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) related to identified deficiencies and related to State, Federal or VA surveys.  The CNH will develop in the time period specified by VA timely and appropriate CAPs for VA surveys or investigation of complaints related to quality of care or sentinel events.  The CNH will also supply related documents or data as specified by VA.  The CAPs will include but are not limited to the following criteria and shall:
 
contain elements detailing how the CNH will correct the deficiency as it relates to the individual;
indicate how the CNH will act to protect residents in similar situations;
Include the measures the CNH will take or systems that will be altered to ensure that the problem will not recur.  The CNH must look at the system and determine if a change to the existing system will work, if a new system is necessary, or if a system does not exist and must be developed;
Indicate how the CNH plans to monitor performance to make sure that solutions are permanent.  The CNH must develop a quality assurance tool for ensuring that correction is achieved and sustained.  This tool must be implemented.  Failure to implement a quality assurance tool to sustain compliance will reflect that the CNH has an ineffective quality assurance system; and
Provide dates when corrective action will be completed.

11.  Life Safety Code. The CNH s building shall conform to the most recent standards of the Life Safety Code (National Fire Protection Association Standard #101) in effect on the date of the IDC award and compliance with all applicable Federal, State and local regulations. The administrator of the CNH is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer in writing at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility which were in existence at the time this IDC became effective.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Safety Manager responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of the CNH and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval or disapproval of the CNH to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes.  These changes may include but are not limited to: 

Interior changes requiring VA approval. Some examples of facility changes that require the VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows:   interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen or trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls or doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems;

Automatic sprinkler system.  All VA contracted CNH facilities are to be fully-equipped with a fully-automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association s (NFPA) standards and be 100% sprinkler;

Natural disasters.  In the event of a natural disaster (flood, tornado, etc.), the CNH shall communicate all action plans to VA.  The action plans will at a minimum identify temporary transfers of location, dates, and names of veterans transferred; and

Major construction; additions; and renovations. Major construction including building additions or other renovations which may affect physical plant integrity; SHALL MEET latest NFPA 101 Life/Safety Code requirements as well as any additional VA CNH construction standards in place at time of renovation or alteration.  

12. Acceptable Safety and Sanitation Practices.  Acceptable safety and sanitation practices shall be observed throughout the facility.  The CNH will address employee and patient safety practices through staff orientation, training and adherence to related policy or procedures to provide a safe and clean environment.

13.  Re-admission to the VA Hospital and Emergency Care; Notification of Death of Veterans; CNH Responsibility to Veteran s Belongings or Personal Effects (QASP Indicator #3).  VA beneficiaries who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  

When such an admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72-ours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility and notice of any veteran death within 24-hours or immediately the first business day after a weekend or holiday.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, readmission to a VA Medical Center may be accomplished as soon as the patient s condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to a VA Medical Center.  

In the event of a death of any veteran, the Contractor agrees to notify VA immediately of the death.  In the event a death of a VA beneficiary while receiving nursing home care under this IDC, the CNH will promptly notify the VA facility which authorized admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient s personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the CNH shall be delivered by the CNH to the person(s) entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the CNH for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs or next of kin capable of inheriting.  

When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases, the CNH will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.  CMS regulations require retention of records for five (5) years when there is no requirement in State law.

14. Leave of Absence (LOA)   Bed-Hold Statement. For re-hospitalizations or therapeutic passes, VA will pay a bed hold.  Therapeutic passes will be authorized by the CNH staff based on individual patient needs, but are generally limited to two (2) times per month and should be pre-approved.  VA will cover bed holds based on the following plan: 

 The host VA medical center will select one of the following options:
 
2 days/episode, pre-approved by VA when in the best interest of the Veteran and VA.Â  Exceptions approved at VAMC level;

Bed-hold will begin the date the resident leaves the CNH and full per diem will resume on the date of readmission to the CNH.  Absences of fifteen (15) consecutive calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility require a new authorization agreement.  The nursing home is responsible to notify the family if a bed hold is required for a longer period.  The family would then make arrangements with the home to hold the bed.  

15. Reportable Events (QASP Indicator #4). VA requires CNHs to report to the CNH Coordinator at VA any of the following events within 24-hours or immediately the first business day after a weekend or holiday:  
Sentinel events; 
When there is a change of ownership of the CNH; 
When there is a change of nursing home administrator or Director of Nursing/Director of Nursing Service; 
substantiated allegations of mistreatment, neglect, abuse or misappropriation of CNH veterans or property; 
Elopements of CNH veterans pursuant to state regulations; 
Infectious outbreaks; 
Resident to resident or resident to staff altercations involving a CNH veteran resulting in any injury that is other than minor; 
Copies of annual surveys or substantiated complaint investigations conducted by a State oversight agency; and 
Adverse events.  Reporting shall include date of occurrence and patient disposition and outcome.  

A sentinel event may include, but is not limited to the following:  
A fall resulting in death or injury; 
Elopement resulting in a missing patient; 
Patient abuse confirmed or under suspicion; 
A medication error resulting in patient illness or injury; 
Death or patient injury related to restraint (including side rails) use; or 
Death related to an unconfirmed or suspicious cause.   

When an adverse event occurs involving a CNH Veteran which is not determined to be a Sentinel Event (but that the State requires that the occurrence be reported to the State), such event is also to be reported to VA s CNH program office.  Some adverse events, such as minor medication errors without catastrophic outcomes, are managed by the CNH in the context of their quality improvement programs.  It is not necessary for nursing homes to report such incidents to the CNH program office.

16.  VA Actions Regarding Serious Quality of Care Deficiencies.  In cases of serious deficiencies affecting the health or safety of veterans or in cases of continued uncorrected deficiencies, VA will take one or more of the following actions in accordance with the terms and clauses of the IDC and applicable procurement regulations:

Increase VA staffing monitoring until the State survey agency clears the deficiency;
Suspend placement of veterans in the CNH;
Remove or transfer veterans under the IDC from the subject CNH;
Not renew the IDC; and/or
Terminate the IDC.
 
17.  VA Staff Access to CNH Records (QASP Indicator #5).  All medical records concerning the veteran s care in the CNH will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or the death of a patient, medical records will be retained by the CNH for a period of at least five (5) years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Â§ 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following:

VAHCS Referral Package to the CNH: 

1.  Copy of Physician Orders for Nursing Home Care; CPRS Notes; Discharge Summary                    including History & Physical information with Medication List; Rehabilitation                   Progress Notes; and Veteran Demographic Record which includes next of kin information. 

         2.  Copy of Authorization Agreement (VAF 10-7078).

b. Nursing Home Clinical Record:  The CNH must maintain clinical records on each veteran in accordance with accepted professional standards and practice. The clinical record must be:  complete, accurately documented, readily accessible, systematically organized, and legible.  Clinical records must contain at a minimum: 

Sufficient information to identify the resident; 
A record of the veteran s assessments, including those assessments performed by services under the IDC with the CNH; 
The plan of care and services including medication administration, provided by CNH staff and services provided under the IDC with the CNH; 
Interdisciplinary progress notes to include effect of care provided, veterans  response to treatment, change in condition, and changes in treatment; 
Medical practitioner orders which are signed and dated; 
Allergies; 
Person to contact in an emergency situation; 
Name of attending medical practitioner; and 
Advanced directives if available. 

c. Clinical Record Safeguards: The CNH must safeguard clinical record information against loss, destruction, or unauthorized use. If the CNH maintains a veteran s record by computer, electronic signatures are acceptable.  If attestation is done on computer records, safeguards to prevent unauthorized access and to provide for reconstruction of information must be in place.

18.  Specialty Services.  The CNH will assume responsibility for arranging specialty care for veterans (e.g., dental care, podiatry and ophthalmology).


19.  VA Health Care System Consultation/Resources. 

 (a)  Telephone Care Communications Systems (TCCS):  For urgent same-day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 318-466-2431/2265 between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same-day appointment is anticipated; please call as early as possible.

 (b)  Admissions Conference Call Systems phone number Phone #:318-466-2431/2265
For non-emergency consultation or /evaluation for admission to the Alexandria VA Health Care System (after initial evaluation or intervention by the nursing home physician).

 (c)  After hours, weekends and holidays:  For urgent referrals or consultation contact the
Admission Conference Call System number 318-466-4402. (Urgent Care), still leave message at the above phone number.

 (d)  Transportation:  Necessary transportation to and from the VA hospital for clinics, evaluation or hospitalization will be arranged by individual nursing homes and paid by the VA hospital for CNH patients when requested.  For Clinic appointments, a consult is needed and sent to CNH for referral.

20. Charitable Contributions. The CNH will not solicit contributions, donations, or gifts from patients or family members.  Note:  Established charitable fundraising activities of a CNH fall outside the scope of this language.

21.  CNH Billing (QASP Indicator #6).  Invoices for board, care and ancillary services shall be submitted promptly to the authorizing facility by the 15th calendar day following the end of the month in which services were rendered.  The CNH will promptly notify the VA CNH Coordinator regarding any change in Veteran status:  discharge, transfer, against medical advice (AMA), hospitalization, death and/or any changes in payer source and any ability to complete timely billing.  All invoices must include the full name and address of the CNH and shall reflect the patient s name, social security number, number of days billed, RUG category (ies), and agreed upon RUG rate (s). Failure to include this information may result in delayed payment.  

Pre-approves services billed by CMS procedures or CPT codes:  All services which are pre-approved by VA as additional to the all-inclusive per diem rate must be billed according to CMS procedures or CPT codes.  The CNH will be reimbursed based on local guidelines and VA pricing schedules.

High cost drugs: All requests for additional reimbursement for high cost drugs and corresponding billing are due as soon as possible, but no later than 90 calendar days after use of products. 

Invoices:  Corrected invoices must be submitted for additional payment of any ancillary costs or changes to the original billing.  All corrected invoices must include all items that are affected by the change.

22.  Minimum Quantities; VA Payment.   It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this IDC.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this IDC, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the CNH as outlined in this IDC.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the CNH but not the day the recipient leaves a CNH unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one (1) day.

23.  VA Payments.   Payments made by VA under any contract pursuant to this IDC, constitute the total cost of nursing home care.  No additional charges will be billed to Medicare (with the exception of hospice), Medicaid, or private insurance, the beneficiary or his/her family, either by the CNH or any third party furnishing services or supplies required for such care, unless and until specific prior authorization in writing is obtained from the VA facility authorizing placement.  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) will not be billed for uncovered services or costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double-billing and Federal fraud.

Vendors who bill electronically using the HIPAA-compliant claims transactions must submit claims through the VA clearinghouse, Emdeon, using payer ID number 12115 for medical claims.

Vendors who are not able to use the HIPAA-compliant transactions are not required to do so.  Supporting information for monthly invoices will be mailed to:

<p>Synopsis:<br />The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/PZIBC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344 publishes this notice of intent to award a sole source firm fixed priced contract for informational purposes only. The United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine Applied Technology and Genomics Division (USAFSAM /FHT) is seeking to procure vendor supported reagents / kits necessary to perform oligonucleotide construction using existing BioAutomation oligonucleotide synthesis instrument, the MerMade 192X (model MERMADE 192X-26, serial number 151201, 711th equipment control number [ECN] 103802). These reagents are required to support the GEIS-funded projects dealing with Upper Respiratory Disease (URD) and Influenza. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334519-Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. Business size standard: 500 Employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is BioAutomation Corporation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract regardless of responses that may be received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 1:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Monday, April 2nd 2018.</p>

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to SNL Financial LC, 1 Snl Plz, Charlottesville, VA 22902 for a project entitled "SNL Unlimited" which is for a one year license subscription for data access to SNL Financial. The sole source award will be made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 235 ( C ) ( 1 ) as implemented by FAR6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies and Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. A justification and approval is currently being processed for this requirement. This requirement is intended as a sole source procurement because the SNL software license will be used to help CMS track the Marketplace premium stabilization programs, the financial stability of Marketplace, enrollment trends in Medicaid and the commercial market, and financial trends in Medicaid and Medicare Advantage.
<p>CMS REQUIREMENTS: The Office of Enterprise Data and Analytics (OEDA) benefits from this procurement because SNL Financial is the only source for this aggregated data in a useful format. Market research indicated that Bloomberg does not provide this data. All the data isn't publicly available. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners offers a proprietary database that requires a fee to access the financial statements of private health insurers. However, the NAIC database is not aggregated in a useful format and would require extremely labor intensive and time consuming work to produce the aggregate data. SNL is the only company that provides access to the data and does the work of aggregating it into a format that is useful to CMS.</p>
<p>NAICS CODES: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 519190 and the size standard is $6.0 million.</p>
<p>INTERESTED PARTIES: All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. In order to qualify as a potential contractor for this procurement, the organization must provide technical literature describing their capability to effectively satisfy this requirement, as well as terms and conditions and a complete price quote within 15 days of this notice, to the following electronic mail address: phillip.harrell@cms.hhs.gov.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This notice is not a Request for Proposals or a Solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. This notice is not a commitment from the Government. The Government will not reimburse any bid or proposal costs as a result of this notice. No solicitation exists and requests for a copy of the solicitation will be disregarded. However, any future solicitation that will be open to competition will be subsequently issued on FedBizOpps in order to permit firms to respond.</p>

<DESC><strong>Synopsis:</strong> <br /><br />NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.<br /></strong><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong><br /><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a novel aircraft design that can carry 150 passengers over a range of 3,500 nautical miles. Key features include a turboelectric propulsion system, twin underwing turbofans, and a rear fuselage electrically driven boundary layer ingesting fan. The design is developed for single-aisle class aircraft (the largest commercial transport class in the world) to significantly reduce fuel burn compared to current aircraft.  Benefits compared to traditional designs include more efficient fuel usage, lower emissions, and reduced weight penalty from additional components.  The novel propulsion architecture uses hydrocarbon fuels to power two underwing turbofans that also contain generators. The underwing turbofans burn traditional jet fuel and provide thrust throughout the mission. The generators on the turbofans extract power from the fan shaft and send the power to a rear fuselage electric motor operating at a constant 3,500 hp. The motor then turns an annular fan that operates at a fan pressure ratio of 1.25. The rear fuselage propulsor is extremely efficient, allowing the turbofans to be decreased in size. This can reduce weight penalties associated with the additional electrical components and rear fan. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.
<p>To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LARC-DL-technologygateway@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company.  Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well. For more information about licensing other NASA Langley-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Langley's Technology Gateway at https://technologygateway.nasa.gov/<br /><br />These responses are provided to members of NASA Langley's Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development "OSACB" for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  <strong>No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice. </strong></p>

<DESC><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><strong><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Synopsis: </span></em></strong><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will be conducting a "Barrel Buster Charrette" for an energy efficient naval surface ship on April 2<sup> </sup>- 4, 2018, in Washington, DC. The "charrette" is a structured workshop that will generate insights into how to leverage new technologies and create new approaches to design that will better integrate systems for optimal efficiency and function. During the charrette, experts from many different fields will work together to produce breakthrough thinking that refines and focuses key opportunities to produce substantial, practicable solutions to major design challenges.<strong></strong></span></em></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Background</span></em></strong><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">: With ever-increasing energy requirements for future mission systems on naval ships, platform efficiency and integration must advance in order to maintain or surpass current mobility capabilities (speed, range). During past ship designs, it has been noted that energy efficient solutions and technologies are often not at an appropriate maturity level to be included. This can be partially attributed to the rapid pace at which new technologies are emerging and partially to the criteria for regarding a technology as sufficiently "mature" to be a candidate for incorporation in a new ship design. For these reasons, energy efficiency performance has not been optimal. This makes the technologies and their systemic combinations ripe for exploration. The process of developing a design for a future ship will therefore seek to eschew past restrictions and look both incrementally and systemically at what is possible.</span></em></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Objectives</span></em></strong><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">: The overall goal of the Barrel Buster program is to undertake a process <br />that will result in breakthrough thinking and new opportunities for resolving crucial design issues for new surface ships. Central to generating this type of thinking is the "charrette" workshop and subsidiary activities, including concept design processes, which will efficiently identify and evaluate key opportunities for energy efficiency. A second key step is to deepen understanding of the opportunities by using set-based design to explore possible ship designs and further testing of how these ideas would work in practice. The final output, to demonstrate implementation of Barrel Buster goals, will be a ship design that incorporates ship design practices, techniques, and potential technologies required to achieve substantial improvements in future surface ship efficiency. </span></em></p>

These experts will be complemented by technology and design specialists from the maritime industry. Each participant will be expected to contribute intensively to the charrette. They will offer their own ideas and expertise while also helping shape others' ideas to be effective and impactful. The charrette will include both plenary and breakout sessions, with an emphasis on maximizing individual involvement and interaction. The charrette agenda and roster will be developed and reviewed by NAVSEA's Technology Office.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT (PLA) SURVEY<br />to<br />Repair Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH)<br />Fort Belvoir, VA</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">PANNAD-18-P-0000-018366</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project ($25.0M - $100.0M) within the National Capital Region. The project is to Repair Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Fort Belvoir, VA.</p>
<p>Buildings 2102, 2103, 2109, 2100, known as the McRee Barracks are three-story unaccompanied enlisted personnel housing barracks constructed in 1975 in the VOLAR 3+1 configuration and subsequently converted to the interim 1+1 configuration. There is a total of 148,763 square feet (SF) of space which is in failed condition. Due to a historic lack of funding there has been no major repair of building components and systems since the facilities were converted to the interim 1+1 configuration 19 years ago. Lack of maintenance, undersized utility systems, and porous construction materials have resulted in severe deterioration and persistent mold growth that negatively impact mission and poses life, health, safety deficiencies.</p>
<p>The new design will consist of a four-bedroom suite, which includes four private bathrooms, common space and kitchenette with stacked washer/ dryer per floor. The lower level will have three-bedroom ABA compliant suites with common space. A social lounge and laundry room is located on the lower level. Exterior work will consist of applying an EFIS system to exterior walls of all four buildings.</p>
<p>Demolition and Abatement: This project will demolish mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems, doors and windows, ceilings, floor coverings, lighting and plumbing fixtures, interior partitions, and interior and exterior finishes. The project will abate asbestos containing materials (ACM) and other HAZMAT items identified in a survey.</p>
<p>Architectural: Roofing, entries, doors and windows, ceilings, floors and floor coverings, interior partitions and interior and exterior finishes. This project will repair the building envelopes including roofing, doors and windows and exterior finishes. Living spaces will be repaired and reconfigured to provide properly sized, private rooms with common use areas with kitchenettes and cooktops. Dayrooms and central laundries will be repaired.</p>
<p>Mechanical and Plumbing Systems: The HVAC systems, including boilers, chillers, piping, ductwork, and controls will be replaced. The plumbing systems, including hot water heaters, hot and cold water piping will be replaced.</p>
<p>Electrical and Lighting: The servicing and interior electrical distribution systems including main and sub distribution panels, switches, wiring, etc. will be replaced.</p>
<p>Fire Protection: The fire detection and alarm systems will be replaced to provide fire safety measures in accordance with current code requirements. Alarm initiating devices (smoke and heat detectors, pull stations, sprinkler system flow detectors), fire alarm notification horns and strobes, and fire suppression hoods are to be replaced.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a prehire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts, specifically, to Repair Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) Fort Belvoir, VA?<br />(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br />(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br />(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br />(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br />(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<br />(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Baltimore Engineer District contract?</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted via email to Mr. Gary Faykes at gary.faykes@usace.army.mil no later than 12 noon local time, 9 April 2018. This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey.</p>

<DESC>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.501(a)(1): For actions for commercial supplies or services greater than the SAT but not exceeding $6.5M, the requirements of FAR 13.501(a) apply to sole-source acquisitions conducted pursuant to Subpart 13.5 (Reference: FAR 13.106-1(b)(2)).
<p>US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Portland District intends to negotiate/award a sole-source contract with Vigor Marine 4PGG4.</p>
<p>The Dredge Yaquina has undergone a complete overhaul at Vigor Marine from Dec 2017 to March 2018. During the overhaul the Bow Thruster has developed an oil leak, although it is unclear where the exact source of the leak is originated, it is assumed to be from the bow thruster or a component of the bow thruster. The Dredge Yaquina will be in the dry dock of Vigor Marine for inspection of the area and to determine the source of the leak. To complete repairs the vessel will need to be dry docked. The additional costs to remove the ship from dry dock and tug to a different location to be dry docked is to great to justify competition. The Yaquina is not currently approved by USCG for travel.</p>
<p>A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE POSTED. The Government intends to proceed with this sole source action. The<br />NAICS code is 336611 - Ship Building and Repairing. Size standard for this NAICS code is 1250 employees.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement to the contracting officer before the notice end date. If no affirmative written responses are received by 12:00 AM local time on 01 April 2018, an award will be made without further notice. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Electronic responses and<br />questions shall be submitted via email to brandon.M.Lasich@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Research and Development Center-Geospatial Research Laboratory (ERDC-GRL) has a requirement for continued operations research, development, enhancement, operational capability demonstration and training of the Sage geospatial tools, and intends to award a single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five (5) year ordering period on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1.<br /><br />Sage is a suite of geospatial tools that were originally developed by ERDC-GRL researchers from fiscal year 2011 through 2014. It has been transitioned to the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) for use on their geospatial workstations and multi-function workstations. The Sage geo-analytics are based on Army doctrine and allow users at all levels to analyze terrain and weather impacts to create Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB) products in support of mission planning. Sage geo-analytics are a complex set of technical models designed by integrating principles of physical science with mathematical functions to support Army Doctrine built into a graphical user interface. <br /><br />This general scope of this IDIQ contract entails the utilization of Sage subject matter expertise to produce technical documentation, conduct technical exchange meetings, design and produce tactical decision aids, conduct operational assessments, prepare instructional material, and provide instructional sessions in support of the Sage system and in response to emerging soldier requirements. In order to execute this work, a Top Secret Level Security Clearance is required. <br /><br />ERDC-GRL intends to sole-source this requirement to Michael Rainey and Associates, LLC (MRA). MRA possesses the unique intellectual capital to provide the highly specialized services required to meet the Government scope of work. MRA's ability to link geospatial analytical processes to planning considerations for logical decision-making enables MRA to design and develop Soldier centric geo-informed decision aids as well as implement a unique training methodology for terrain-based mission planning. Below is a detailed rationale to support the decision to sole source:<br /><br />a) MRA has developed a unique and innovative training concept that applies the theory of Andragogy (Adult Learning Theory) specifically to the Army Doctrine Publication (ADP) 7-0, Training Units and Developing Leaders, in order to develop competent, confident, agile, and adaptive leaders.<br /><br />b) MRA has developed a unique and ground-breaking approach that incorporates the use of commercially designed geographic information systems in order to provide combatant commands from Theater to Small Unit Level a more thorough understanding of the operational environment. <br /><br />c) MRA possesses the unique intellectual capital to link the geospatial analytical processes to the planning considerations for logical decision-making specific to Army mission requirements in the design and development of geospatially based tactical decision aids. <br /><br />d) MRA has pioneered the employment of Applied Systems Design and Decision Making, Value Focused Thinking, and Multi-Objective Decision Analysis in the production, operation, and assessment of computer aided algorithms with specific features essential for the execution of Mission Analysis (MA) and Course of Action (COA) Development within the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).<br /><br />e) MRA has developed the intellectual capital for geospatially based tactical decision aids specifically designed for US Army doctrinal Health Service Support planning. This unique capability provides medical planners with relevant and actionable terrain based decision support tools that enable direction, management, and/or coordination of assigned medical forces, assets, and resources in the accomplishment of assigned missions.<br /><br />f) MRA has developed the intellectual capital to conduct systematic design of experiments within US Army operational units acceptance testing that assess the relationships between contributing factors that affect the process being evaluated and the output of that respective process.<br /><br />This posting is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. <br /><br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 which has a size standard of $15,000,000.00. This is not a small business set aside. Any interested party that believes they can fulfill this requirement should submit a capability statement to be reviewed. All submissions will be considered, however there is no guarantee that submissions in response to this notice will in any way alter the Government's acquisition strategy. <br /><br />Please provide responses to this notice no later than 27 April 2018 at 11:59 AM, Central Standard Time (CST), to:<br /><br />CERL-CT-QUOTES@usace.army.mil<br /><br />Telephone responses will not be accepted. <br /><br />Responses to this notice will not be considered as a response to any solicitation, a request to be added to a prospective offerors list, or to receive a copy of any solicitation. A determination by the Government not to compete the contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>A notice of intent to sole source synopsis (special notice) will be posted on FBO to notify the public of the Government's intent to make a sole source award for the Main Operating Room (MOR) at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP). This sole source award is for surgical supplies that the surgeon has deemed necessary for proper patient care. This award is based upon the surgeon's diagnosis and patient's plan of care. The supplies are very specific to the surgical procedure being performed and are what is required for MOR to satisfy its mission at NMCP. Any deviation from the specifications of these products will increase risk to the patient and is unacceptable to the Government. Surgery date: 26 April 2018. Sole source documents are attached to special notice.<br />

The Roman Catholic faith is a significant cross section of patients and staff requiring religious support at NMCSD. Approximately 30% of the hospital nature of pastoral care to Roman Catholics is sacramental in nature. The celebration and administration of sacraments requires the presence of a Catholic Priest. The decreased availability of Navy Catholic Chaplains has created a situation in which adequate Catholic coverage is not available at NMCSD. Therefore, it is essential that Contract Catholic Priests are available to provide pastoral care and sacraments to Roman Catholic patients and staff at NMCSD. </span></p>
