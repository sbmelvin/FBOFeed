CAPABILITIES STATEMENT:  In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement detailing:  (1) knowledge of written  and spoken Farsi equal to that of a university-educated native speaker of the language;  must be fluent in Farsi as currently used in Iran; mastery of English and Farsi that enables Offeror to review and translate an exceptionally wide range of material as cited in this RFP;  (2) journalistic skills equal to U.S. standards of professional, objective reporting with emphasis on interpreting American society to foreign audiences, making output interesting, understandable and relevant; (3) skill in resolving linguistic problems such as applying terms of new scientific, economic and technological processes where recent available sources may not provide guidance; ability to translate accurately where sensitive policy issues are involved;  (4) familiarity with domestic and international developments as they affect U.S. policy;  sensitivity toward and knowledge of the cultural, historical and geographic make-up of the region and countries to which the Washington File is delivered.    TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  detail how you plan to approach the base year of the project and tasks;  include up to fifteen (15) pages of sample translations into Farsi;. describe how you will approach and manage the project if each of the four option years are implemented.   COST PROPOSAL:  this will be a Firm Fixed Price type contract.  The Cost Proposal must not exceed two (2) pages and must be a separate document from the Capabilities Statement/Technical Proposal.  Separate the base year price from the optional four year tasks. Price each of the optional four years.

EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS:    the following factors are considered more important than price, and will be considered roughly equal in importance: (1)  knowledge of written and spoken Farsi equal to that of a university-educated native speaker with fluency in Farsi as currently used in Iran;  college level fluency in English;  (2) journalistic skills equal to U.S. standards of professional, objective reporting with emphasis on interpreting American society to foreign audiences;  (3) ability to write original copy and translate complex material accurately into Farsi as currently used in Iran;    (4) ability to review and evaluate translations by others and resolve linguistic problems as described in this RFP;  (5) skills preparing Farsi language materials for the Web and e-mail/listserv transmissions, including ability to use current computer hardware and software technologies used to produce, process and transmit web-based material.  Between proposals that are evaluated as substantially equal in quality, the price to the Government will be a major factor in selection for an award.  The Government may not conduct negotiations so submit your best offer.  The Government reserves the right to request an Oral Presentation by the Offeror.  CONTRACT AWARD:  Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFP, provides an overall best value to the Government.
