<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE -- The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) laboratory facility in Morgantown, WV previously purchased a Micromass quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-ToF-2) via competitive procedures in 1999.  The warranties have expired and the Government desires to provide continued maintenance for this sensitive analytical instrument.  The Government intends to negotiate with the original equipment manufacturer, Micromass, Inc. (Waters Corp.), Milford, MA to provide continued annual maintenance because we are not aware of any other vendor that could provide the necessary support due to proprietary design features of the instrument and controlling software.  Organizations who believe they can provide the support may respond within seven (7) days after publication of this notice.  Responses shall be submitted to: Kimberly P. Groves (MS-1019), Reference #000HCC36-2005-16168, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV  26505.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if alternate sources exist, therefore, no solicitation available.  This notice is issued for informational purposes only.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has developed a software program that walks a user through filling out and electronically filing a Confidential Financial Disclosure Form, OGE-450 or Statement of No New Interests, 450A.  These are forms that are required to be filed by thousands of FAA employees and probably hundreds of thousands of government employees throughout the Executive Branch. We would like to enter into a collaborative agreement with a private sector software company which would require the company to, among other things, maintain the program current with any changes to laws or regulations, add functionalities that we have not yet been able to develop, provide upgrades to the FAA, etc.  In return, the company may get an opportunity to sell the program to other government agencies.  Government agencies would have to pay for the program but would save hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, in government time spent manually reviewing these f!  orms. Program Description: The software program walks the user through filing a Confidential Financial Disclosure Statement, OGE-450, or Certificate of No New Interests, OGE-450A.  The program has hard edits that ensure the form is completely and properly filled out. Once completed, the form is automatically uploaded to a central, secure location.   The program automatically accomplishes many of the tasks traditionally performed by employees of each FAA Line of Business (LOB) and administrative personnel at the field level.  For example, it automatically: (1) sends a message to all required filers advising them that they are required to file by October 31 with instructions; (2) tracks who has filed and who has not filed; (3) sends a message reminding filers who have not yet filed that they must file by October 31; (4) sends a "thank you" message to those who have filed, confirming receipt of their electronically filed form; and (5) notifies Division Managers when their employees fail to file.  Because this is the first year filers are using the Program to upload forms, we are requiring them to submit a hardcopy of the file to this office as well uploading their form electronically.   However, the Program automatically tracks filers, without the need to for each Division to track this information and follow-up. We are presently compiling data to determine approximately how much time and money the program has saved thus far at both the filing stage and the review stage. Future Enhancements: The program will be enhanced to automatically recognize prohibited stocks and generate a memo requiring divestiture of prohibited stock(s).  Other future applications include the Program recognizing financial interests that require a warning letter and generating the letter automatically.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) of Huntsville, Alabama, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The Office of the Secretary of Defense has designated USSOCOM as the lead to an advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD) of a semi-active laser (SAL) seeker based, standoff Precision Guided Munition (PGM) released from an AC-130.  The purpose of this ACTD is to demonstrate the military utility of such a capability, not to develop a SAL PGM for an AC-130 or to mandate a particular technology for any possible future production effort.  Additionally, the initiation of this ACTD does not mean that a formal program has been initiated.  Instead, if this ACTD is successful in that military utility is proven, then a formal program may be initiated.  If a formal program is later initiated, then other technologies that are currently less mature than the proposed technology for this ACTD or that do not meet the requirements of this ACTD might be possible solutions.  In contrast, without a successful ACTD, further pursuance of this type of technology on a Gunship platform by DoD might not occur at all.  The reason justifying the lack of competition is that NGC’s SAL guided Modified Brilliant Anti-armor Technology (BAT) Submunition, based on the fully developed, qualified, and fielded BAT submunition, is the only technology that currently meets the Department of Defense (DOD) ACTD guidelines for maturity, while addressing the unique capabilities required to successfully perform this ACTD.  With respect to the unique capabilities required for performance of this ACTD, the BAT submunition must have a SAL PGM, internal carriage that will not cause depressurizing the aircraft, adversely impacting the drag of the aircraft, and not exceeding 50 pounds per munition.  Moreover, the BAT submunition must have standoff range capability and allow variable time delay fuzing.  These unique capabilities are an integral part of this ACTD.  Award to other than NGC would not allow USSOCOM to meet the criteria to execute an ACTD and demonstrate military utility.  Additionally, the sole source to NGC is justified by the competitive nature of the OSD ACTD review and selection process.  This contractor submitted ACTD was the only one proposed which addressed incorporation of a previously developed munition onto the AC-130 to dramatically improve its warfighting capabilities.  Period of performance is for approximately three years.  The expected NAICS is 332993.  Any responsible source responding to this announcement must address the requirements of Note 22.  Specifically, a Note 22 response must show (1) that the proposed technology meets the technology readiness levels of this ACTD and (2) that the proposed technology has the unique capabilities required to perform this ACTD.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via facsimile to ((813) 828-7504) attention Mr. Charlie Bright or email to brightc@socom,mil

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard intends to solicit, negotiate and award a sole-source procurement using those procedures under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Item to TKC Communications (TKCC), 711 H. Street, Suite 510, Anchorage, AK.  

The procurement is for electronics maintenance support to the Vessel Traffic System (VTS) Aids to Navigation, Automated Identification System (AIS) Ports and Water Ways Safety System (PAWWSS) in Prince William Sound, Alaska.  TKCC currently maintains the existing VTS VHF radio system and the digital microwave backbone that supports the VTS in Prince William Sound.  TKCC is currently under contract with the Coast Guard to provide electronic maintenance support for the National Voice Distress System (NDS) located throughout Alaska, which includes the current VTS and related remote sites in Prince William Sound.  The AIS/PAWWSS shall be incorporated into the VTS.  The two systems (NDS and VTS) share the same resources, infrastructure (radios, towers, power supplies, control centers, microwave and high sites), and Coast Guard customer (System Operators). The system is so integrated that it would be very difficult to isolate or distinguish maintenance responsibility between multiple contractors.

TKCC is in the best position to most effectively integrate the maintenance of the AIS - PAWWSS of the VTS into their current NDS workload which would thereby eliminate the possibility for overlapping preventive and corrective maintenance calls, and potential claims and dispute between individual contractors. 

The VTS is composed of 6 remote sites (Pt. Pigot, Cape Hinchinbrook, Naked Island, Potato Point, Valdez Spit Site, Reef Island) and the Vessel Traffic Center in Valdez, AK.  The Contractor shall provide to the Vessel Traffic Center (VTC), for that segment (approximately 1/3 of the total VTS) of the AIS PAWWSS 98% system availability for that area of responsibility. The Contractor shall provide a 24 hour/ 7 days a week Point of Contact, with an 800 number, to respond to any and all system outages by the Coast Guard. The Contractor shall be responsible for arranging all transportation services to and from system sites under contract.  The Contractor shall provide preventive and corrective maintenance with a 1-hour response time, depot repair maintenance, computer network hardware maintenance, and property management of Government equipment.  The Contractor will be responsible for troubleshooting associated microwave systems. The Contractor shall also be responsible for scheduling and purchasing all helicopter services, repair and replacement of failed equipment and assemblies.  

The period of performance is one base period of performance, approximately 7 months with two one-year options.  This is not a request for proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement.  A solicitation document is not available at this time.  If no responses have been received within 15 days of this notice with sufficient information to determine that another responsible source is available, negotiations will be conducted with TKCC.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This notice is for informational purposes only, Minority and Women-owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking potential sources for services in support of SETA staff augmentation in the area of Threat Systems Engineering for the MDA Deputy for Systems Engineering and Integration  (SE).  The contractor will be required to perform tasks within the broad framework of the Statement of Objectives, while working in close coordination and cooperation with the MDA government staff and other support contractors.  The scope of the work effort shall include: (1) expert scientific and engineering support to the TSEP through independent technical analyses and assessments; (2) participation in TSEP reviews, meetings, information exchanges and working groups; (3) detailed engineering and design studies of threat systems and associated countermeasures; (4) conducting Threat Risk Assessments (TRAs); (5) development and maintenance of technical databases; (6) supporting TSEP experiments and reporting results from those experiments; and, (7) interfacing and close coordination with divisions within MDA/SE, organizations internal to MDA, MDA’s Executing Agents, and the DoD Intelligence Community.

MDA intends to utilize GSA ordering procedures to acquire the services described in this notice.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, with a size standard of 1,000 employees.  This requirement is unrestricted; however, MDA reserves the right to limit the sources solicited for this procurement to only small businesses in the event a sufficient number of qualified small business sources responding to this notice are judged best qualified to compete for this work.  All small business respondents shall confirm that they currently hold a GSA Schedule contract under which they are certified as a small business.  Only interested GSA schedule holders judged best qualified to compete for the work will be sent a Request for Quotations (RFQ) package on or about November 16, 2004, with offers due approximately four (4) weeks later.

The estimated Man Year Equivalents (MYE) for this requirement is approximately 13.5 MYE.  Three positions will be on-site and 10.5 positions will be off-site.  Of the estimated 13.5 MYE, ten MYE will require a TOP SECRET SCI clearance and three MYE will require a TOP SECRET clearance.

The ALMDS is a LIDAR Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) high area coverage system that detects, classifies, and localizes floating and near-surface moored sea mines.  The system represents a capability that does not exist in the current Mine Co! untermeasures (MCM) inventory. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  (a) This acquisition implements the U.S. Navys acquisition strategy as documented in the Single Acquisition Management Plan (SAMP) No. 0001-02-PMS 210, Revision 1 approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (ASN(RD&A)) on 09 June 2003. The SAMP states that LRIP quantities will be acquired sole source from the system developer. (b) Northrop Grumman Corporation is and has been the sole developer of the AN/AES-1 ALMDS system since the competitive award of the SD&D phase contract. There have been no other contractual actions related to the SD&D phase awarded since this contract. Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to work through the SD&D it is reasonable to assert that Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully produce the systems. (c) This is a follow-on contract for the production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that, given the limited number of systems being acquired, is not expected to be recovered through competition. There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.  The systems will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. Delivery will be sixteen (16) months after award of contract.  The NACIS is 332999, Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees, the FSC is 1287. Contract Specialist: Mary F. Hines, Code XPS1, NSWC-PC, 100 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001, mary.f.hines@navy.mil. Note 22 applies.

POC:  Marcia Goldman, Contract Specialist (301) 496-2302 
DESC:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical and customer service capabilities of businesses interested in providing dosimetry services to NIH. NIH possesses a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license authorizing its use of radioactive materials that includes requirements for performing routine monitoring for external occupational exposure, notification of individuals and their supervisors when exposures approach maximum permissible limits, and making recommendations for remedial action whenever appropriate.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government (the Customer), the Contractor shall furnish the personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies necessary to provide a comprehensive external exposure monitoring program, including associated services, in accordance with the requirements of the NIH license.  Through the Division of Radiation Safety (DRS), the Office of Research Services (ORS) provides radiation exposure monitoring services to NIH employees who utilize radioactive materials and radiation producing equipment in the course of their research.  The ORS is seeking organizations that can provide state of the art dosimetry equipment, timely reading and reporting of the monitoring results, and a comprehensive, interactive database from which historical and regulatory data may be readily obtained.  The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS Code 541380 size standard  6.0 million.  The ORS intends to award a new contract to the dosimetry provider whose services most adequately support the programs and the needs of the NIH.  Services that will be required by this procurement will include, but are not limited to, the furnishing of all personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies considered essential for providing all specified types of personal and environmental dosimeters, including dosimeter calibration, monitoring, and necessary associated services in accordance with NIH requirements.  These requirements shall include maintaining a Certificate of Accreditation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through its National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for all test categories applicable to whole body, extremity, and environmental dosimeters.  Additional requirements include the ability to utilize existing NIH methodology for record keeping and identification of employees and lab groups, permitting direct computer access to personnel monitoring database(s) by DRS personnel, participation in a joint QA/QC program as directed by the DRS, and providing dosimetry equipment that is hermetically sealed such that it permits gas and/or liquid wash sterilization while guarding against damage from water and laboratory chemicals.  Additionally, qualified businesses should demonstrate a propensity for the development and incorporation of innovative and efficiency-improving systems, products, and customer service into their proposed dosimetry service.   An example would be the availability of operational or electronic dosimeter systems that allow for on-site management of personnel exposures.  Experience in managing similar dosimetry service contracts must be demonstrated. This market survey is being conducted through the CBD to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information. Responding firms should provide two (2) copies of their capability statement to the Office of Procurement Management at the address provided not later than January 31, 2005.. Please send to the attention of Marcia Goldman, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 539A, Bethesda, Maryland  20892-7663



Basic Services:
 
1.  Whole Body Dosimeters:  Whole body monitoring systems will preferably use optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) or an equivalent technology.  The ideal system involves the use of a single monitor capable of detecting beta, gamma, and neutron radiations.  The monitor must be designed for "clip-on" attachment to a worker's clothing for use under normal conditions, but should also be versatile enough to be adaptable to other monitoring situations such as extremity-wrist, lens of eye, or area monitoring if required.  The system should possess a minimum reporting precision of 1 mrem with complete re-analysis capability to allow for dose measurement confirmation, it should incorporate a filtering mechanism that allows for differentiation between the various types and energies of radiation encountered, and it must be capable of qualitatively detecting and quantitatively measuring dose equivalents from low- and high-energy beta; low-, medium- and high-energy photon radiations; and neutrons in the thermal, intermediate, and fast ranges.  Accreditation must be in NVLAP categories I through VI as defined in ANSI/HPS N13.11 - 2001, Personnel Dosimetry Performance - Criteria for Testing.

A.  Minimum Reportable Doses:
(1) gamma, x ray -  1 mrem
(2) energetic beta -  10 mrem
(3) neutron -	 10 mrem thermal;  20 mrem fast
B.	Minimum Detectable Energies:
(1) gamma, x ray -  5 keV
(2) energetic beta -  150 keV
(3) neutron -  0.025 eV thermal;  0.5 eV to 144 keV intermediate;  > 144 keV fast
C.	Minimum Detection Ranges:
(1) low and high energy gamma, x ray -  1 mrem to 1000 rem
	(2)	beta -  10 mrem to 1,000 rem
(3)	neutron -  20 mrem to 25 rem
D.	Analysis and quantification above 1000 rem must be available upon request.
E.	Sterilization: Dosimeters should be hermetically sealed and if possible, capable of being sterilized by gases such as ethylene oxide, or by solutions such as Betadine, Cidex, Wescodyne, or other similar means without compromising the integrity or capability of the monitor. 

Whole Body Monitor Option:  The contractor may substitute or offer another currently available dosimetry technology as an alternative to the OSL system, providing that the performance characteristics and the information available from the dosimeter provide comparable quantitative and qualitative data such as: static vs. dynamic exposure, shielded exposure, (i.e. an image of the exposure is available).

2.  Extremity Dosimeter:  Ring dosimeters shall be available as extremity monitors.  OSL is preferred, however, monitoring may also be accomplished via thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) extremity finger monitors.  Monitors shall be designed either as an adjustable ring or supplied in a minimum of three sizes (small, medium, and large).  Rings shall be designed with a label that bears all necessary identifying information in such a manner that it is impervious to fading/smearing due to moisture/washing.  TLD dosimeters shall be manufactured of Harshaw TLD-100 LiF ribbon or equivalent that is near tissue equivalency, possessing high sensitivity, a low fade rate, and extreme durability.  Accreditation must be in NVLAP extremity categories I through IV as defined in ANSI/HPS N13.32 - 1995, Performance Testing of Extremity Dosimeters.


A.	Minimum Reportable Doses:
(1) gamma, x ray - 30 mrem
(2) energetic beta - 40 mrem
B.   Minimum energy sensitivity:
(1) gamma, x ray - 10 keV
(2) energetic beta - 200 keV
C.	Minimum Detection Ranges:
(1) low and high energy gamma, x ray - 30 mrem to 1,000 rem
(2) beta over 1 MeV - 50 mrem to 1,000 rem
D.	Analysis and quantification above 1000 rem must be available upon request. 
E.	Ultraviolet Sensitivity: possible exposure to UV radiation shall be minimized or eliminated by the use of UV absorbing materials.
F.	Sterilization: Rings must be capable of being sterilized by gases such as ethylene oxide, or by solutions such as Betadine, Cidex, Wescodyne, or other similar products without compromising the integrity or capability of the monitor. 

Extremity Ring OSL Option: The contractor may substitute or offer another currently available extremity ring monitor technology as an alternative to the OSL, providing that the performance characteristics and information available from the dosimeter meets or exceeds that provided by the ring monitor described above.

3.  Environmental Dosimeter:  Environmental TLDs are deployed on a quarterly basis and shall be capable of a minimal detectable exposure of approximately 1 mrem.  The dosimeter shall consist of a minimum of two (2) tissue equivalent TLD elements in a single holder, with packaging that is weatherproof and suitable for deployment, as is, in the normal environment (rain, snow, sun, etc.) without the need for additional weather protection or housings.  The devices shall be provided with an easily deployable mounting device or container which is tamper resistant and can be easily fastened to signs, trees, lamp posts, etc., through the use of wire ties, clips, or other non-permanent fasteners.  The color should be black or some other non-vibrant/dull color, and the label containing required identifying information must be resistant to smearing and/or fading as a result of exposure to extreme or continued inclement weather.  Accreditation must be in accordance with ANSI N545.

A.	Error Limits:  Measurement error should not exceed 100% at the 95% confidence level for exposures below 10 mrem/quarter; and 30% at the 95% confidence level for exposures above 10 mrem/quarter.
B.	Filtration:  Filtration shall be such that at least one element is provided with at least 250 mg/cm2 of filtration.  
C.	Fade:  The dosimeter's fade characteristics shall be such that the dosimeter will not fade in excess of ten percent (10%) per quarter.
D.	The dosimeter must be accurate, durable, and measure to 1 mrem ambient dose equivalent:

Type of	Energy of	Dose Range		
Radiation	Radiation	 ( rem )  	Error Limit (%) 
  		X-ray, gamma	     .05 - 2 MeV           .001 - 10	(see text above)

Environmental TLD Option:  The contractor may substitute or offer as an alternative another available Environmental Dosimeter technology, provided that the performance characteristics and information available from the dosimeter meets or exceeds that listed above.

4.	Quantity:  The following required quantities will change over the life of this contract, with stated estimates reflecting current program requirements. Continuing program and regulatory review will dictate necessary changes in specific requirements for contract option years.  It is not anticipated that the total number of persons monitored will vary by more than + 25% each year.

The contractor shall be able to provide weekly monitoring services for the following items:

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is conducting market research regarding replacement of the steering system onboard its 75’ Tow boats.  A complete system including controls, motor starters and alarms, hydraulic power unit, and hydraulic steering gear.  CG 75’ Towboats are designated Inland Construction Tenders (WLIC) and Western Rivers Buoy Tenders (WLR) depending on their geographic location and whether the Aids to Navigation they manage are fixed structures or floating buoys.  Each towboat is 75’ in length with a 22’ beam, 4.5’ draft and 141 ton displacement.  The towboat works with an attached barge; barges range in length from 68’ to 130’.  Each tender has two diesel engines with two propulsion shafts and will be re-powered from 370 HP/shaft to 650 HP/shaft concurrent with replacing the steering system.  The electrical power is 450V, 3 phase, 60 cycle ungrounded.  WLR’s currently have two steering rudders and two flanking (backing) rudders, where as WLIC’s currently have only two steering rudders.  Replacing the steering system will include adding a flanking rudder system to the WLIC’s. The control system should include three full follow up helm stations to be installed amidships, and port and starboard sides of the pilothouse console, one non follow up helm station to be installed amidships in the pilothouse, one emergency helm station to be installed in the steering compartment, a steering control selector switch, and rudder position indicators for the steering and flanking rudders.  Each full follow up station should include separate levers to operate the steering and flanking rudders in an arrangement that allows the helmsman to operate both levers with one hand.  A means for connecting the pilothouse helm levers is desired in order to allow the helmsman to move from station to station without shifting control to the other station. The motor starters and alarms will be installed adjacent to the hydraulic power unit in the steering compartment, however a second remote alarm system is required for installation in the pilothouse. The hydraulic power unit should include separate primary and secondary pumps to operate the steering and flanking hydraulic steering systems.  Common CG practice is to alternate steering pumps during routine operations and to place both pumps online to provide faster rudder response during restricted maneuvering situations.  The hydraulic steering system should include adjustable tie-bars to mechanically link both steering rudders so that they move together in unison and a separate means to link both flanking rudders so that they move together in unison.  Maximum rudder angle is 35° in each direction and the hydraulic system should be capable of moving the rudder from hard over to hard over in less than 20 seconds with one hydraulic pump on line and less than 10 seconds with two hydraulic pumps on line.  The hydraulic steering system should include tiller arms and a means of securing them to the rudderposts.  The steering rudders are spaced approximately 12-13 feet apart and flanking rudders are spaced approximately 8-10 feet apart.  The steering and flanking rudderposts have an outside diameter of 4 ½” and the calculated rudder torque is 1800 Lbft.  Anyone wishing to respond to this notice, please provide the following information: (1) Please submit complete literature about your product.  Be sure it includes complete information. (2) Is your company a small or large business? (small business is less than 500 employees); (3) Do you offer this product commercially? (4) If not, do you offer a commercial product that could be modified to meet this requirement? (5) Do you believe there is a better method of fulfilling this requirement? (6) What type of quantity or other discounts do you offer your customers? (7) What is your standard commercial warranty? (8) Are there any additional charges for special marking and packing (i.e. bar coding, individually packaged); (9) What is your standard commercial packaging and marking? (10) What is your average delivery lead time for this type of product?  (11) Do you expect to offer a new product that might affect this requirement?  (12) Do you have a published price list?  If not, explain how pricing is derived.  (13) How long do you plan to support your product?  Please send your information to sjackson@elcbalt.uscg.mil or mail to Commanding Officer, U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center, Auxiliary Systems Acquisition Branch, Mail Stop 99, 2401 Hawkins Point Rd., Bldg. 31, 2nd floor, Baltimore, MD 21226-5000. This is not a request for proposal.  The Coast Guard will not pay for information provided.

<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to man-made or natural disasters. In 2002, HHS established the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP). This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population. The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for response to a public health emergency.  ***DESCRIPTION***  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. DHHS/OPHEP/ORDC has a requirement for the acquisition and maintenance of novel therapeutic products for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to treat U.S. civilians exposed to weapons of mass destruction, including nerve agents.  Nerve agents include organophosphorous insecticides, soman, sarin, tabun, VX and Non-Traditional Agents (NTA’s).  HU-BCHE has been demonstrated to be effective as a prophylactic against nerve agent induced mortality and morbidity.  HU-BChE is isolated and purified from the Cohn Fraction IV-4 of human plasma. The Government has an interest in identifying sources of GMP HU-BChE and developing capabilities for the licensure of an appropriately formulated preparation of HU-BChE for either intravenous or intramuscular injection.  While proof-of-principle animal studies have been completed, additional animal challenge studies are likely needed to support the eventual licensure of the product.  In responding to this RFI, indicate the proposed process for extraction and purification; potential formulations for intramuscular injection; and production capacity annually (estimate).  

The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources of HU-BChE, manufactured under a commercial scale GMP process, tested for efficacy in animal models of nerve agent exposure and for safety in human volunteers.  Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nation’s bioterrorism defense needs. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS. All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 

Information must be submitted by January 14, 2005. Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and can be e-mailed to the attention of Darrick A. Early, phone 202-401-3693, email darrick.early@hhs.gov. Please ensure that at least TWO (2) COPIES of all responses are submitted.

Under provisions laid out in the Project BioShield Act of 2004, future competition may be limited to sources responding to this request for information (Sec. 319F-2(c)(7)(C)(vii) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d-6b).

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to assist with the conduct of a large scale nationally-representative school-based  survey on adolescent health behavior.  The Prevention Research Branch (PRB), an intramural research group of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), conducts research on child and adolescent health behavior.  One of the PRB areas of emphasis is assessment of the prevalence and determinants of health behavior among adolescents.  Toward this end, the PRB plans to conduct a national probability survey of U.S. 6th-10th graders that is also consistent with the requirements of the international Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey.  

The HBSC survey is conducted among national or regional samples of students at ages 11, 13, and 15 years of age in about 35 countries.  The international HBSC survey requires at least 1536 youth in each age group and a total of 5000 students.  The goal of the HBSC survey is to obtain data about adolescent health behavior and to make this information available so as to enable the improvement of health services and programs for youth. The goals of the U.S. survey are to provide health behavior information about adolescents nationally (U.S.-specific protocol) and to enable international comparisons by incorporating the mandatory HBSC protocol.  A survey consistent with the HBSC was conducted in the U.S. previously in 1997-1998 and 2001-2002.  In international comparisons, previous HBSC surveys showed that U.S. 15-year-old youth are less likely to smoke than students in most other countries surveyed, even though 13-year-old US students experiment with tobacco in comparable proportions to youth in other countries.  The most recent survey demonstrated that U.S. youth are more likely to be overweight than students in the other HBSC countries.  U.S. eating habits were also shown to be less healthy with a comparatively high proportion of youth consuming high fat foods and soft drinks with sugar.  Analyses of the U.S. national data set have addressed bullying, unintentional injury, and utilization of health care.  
            
The 2005-2006 U.S. survey will address health-related factors according to rigorous protocols to be developed by the HBSC by June of 2005, and should also include additional factors and dimensions that are relevant to the U.S. experience.  To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate their ability to:  1)  develop a school-based, national probability sampling plan that would provide a nationally-representative sample, including appropriate over-sampling of racial minority students; 2) employ contacts at state and local departments of education and school districts to gain access to schools for surveys;  3)  identify and recruit in a period of 4 months a national sample of middle and high schools involving > 15000 students and > 400 schools (representing a national probability sample from which the total of 5000 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 year-old  students for the HBSC subsample will be drawn) with an 80% rate of participation;  4) identify, establish, and maintain a national network of data collectors; 5) recruit, train, and manage data collectors working in locations dispersed across the country; 6) conduct a nation school-based survey involving >15000 students and >400 schools; 7) employ SUDAN or similar statistical programs for basic management of weighted samples; 8) manage large data sets with students nested within schools; 9) prepare data summaries and preliminary analyses; and 10) prepare public use data set. 

AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.    THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541910.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is $6 million in annual receipts. For the calculation of annual receipts see parts 121.104 and 121.106 in SBA's Small Business Size Regulations.  SUBMITTED CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST ALSO ADDRESS HOW THE BUSINESS MEETS THE APPLICABLE SIZE STANDARD. 

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to attention of Jason Williams at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on Monday, December 20, 2004.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should address each of the competencies stated above.  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside for small businesses only.    

All Capability Statements must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the announcement to: Jason Williams, Contracting Officer, Contracts Management Branch, OAM, NICHD, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).

Description

Department of the Air Force, Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Directorate of Communications & Information, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas is seeking sources capable of providing commercial television services to thirteen geographically separated installation lodging (billeting) facilities and one hospital. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only. This information will be used in conducting market research to identify potential sources and commercial products and obtain prices. It should be noted that the need for cost/price data, if even only rough order of magnitude data, is to assist in the planning process. This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bid (IFB), request for proposal (RFP), or request for quotation (RFQ), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the United States Air Force. 

Overview

Television services in AETC are currently provided on a one base-one contract basis. The Government seeks to consolidate television services to all fourteen (14) AETC facilities in a way that meets or exceeds the required service level through one command-wide television services contract.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) of the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate desires to issue a sources sought announcement to identify potential U.S. sources and gather information on current capabilities within the domestic market.  Small businesses, as well as all offerors, are encouraged to respond to this sources sought announcement.  Responses should include information identifying whether the offeror’s firm is a small or large business.  The size standard is 500 employees.  The  NAICS code for this potential effort is 541710.   This is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR 31.205-18, “Bid and Proposal Costs.”  Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office, Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) is contemplating a procurement to establish a domestic manufacturing capability for the design and fabrication of mono-spectral and multi-spectral optical lens assemblies and component systems to be primarily used by the warfighter in fire control, weaponsight, and surveillance applications.  The envisioned end-to-end lens assemblies will be manufactured for military, commercial, and other surveillance applications.  Firms without domestic R&D and production capabilities are ineligible for any potential award.

Title III of the Defense Production Act authorizes the Federal Government to provide appropriate incentives to develop, maintain, modernize, and expand the productive capacities of domestic sources for critical components, critical technology items, and industrial resources essential for the execution of the national security strategy of the United States.  The principal role of Title III is to establish and maintain domestic production capacity for critical technology items and industrial resources essential to national defense.  This is primarily achieved by providing incentives, which serve as a stimulus to domestic industry to create, expand, or preserve economically viable capabilities.  This is accomplished in partnership with a supplier through the sharing of costs, risks, technical knowledge, decisions, information, and insight.  Risk reduction is an important consideration in this partnership in that a Title III investment is only undertaken when it is determined that the private sector is either unwilling or unable to assume the risks associated with the creation of a targeted capacity.

Under the authority of the DPA, any potential acquisition is restricted to sources with domestic R&D and production capabilities.  The Title III Program Office is interested in transitioning from foreign produced mono-spectral optical systems to domestically produced mono-spectral and advanced multi-spectral optical systems.  Reliable multi-spectral lens manufacturing is essential for applications using shared-aperture and multiple-aperture systems that employ Image Intensifiers, Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) uncooled focal plane arrays, Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) and Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR) cooled arrays in various combinations for government and commercial uses.  

The Title III Program Office is interested in developing a manufacturing capability for design, fabrication, coating, assembly, and testing of mono and multi-spectral night vision optical systems that can be integrated into military and commercial surveillance systems.  While lens assemblies constitute the bulk of the existing market, both lens assemblies and component systems manufacturing are being considered.  The successful awardee will seek to become a domestic market supplier of mono and multi-spectral optical systems and achieve independent financial viability by addressing the needs of both government and commercial customers.  Manufacturing requirements for mono and multi-spectral lens and components vary widely depending on their use and functionality.  Interested parties must be able to work with perspective customers to determine product specifics and satisfy those disparate demands on an individual basis.  Contractors unable to meet these minimum technical requirements should not respond to this announcement. 

The government contemplates this project will consist of multiple phases.  In the initial phase, the contractor will document technical requirements and conduct a business case analysis.  The Government anticipates awarding a follow-on multi-phase contract incorporating the results provided from the initial phase effort.  Interested contractors should possess documented expertise and an existing capability in the development and production of mono and multi-spectral optics.  Contractors should identify their interest and capability to respond to any potential requirement by submitting the information required under Note 25. 

All submitted information should be limited to no more than 25 pages, one-sided, minimum font size 10 and should be sent to Michele Tritt, Contract Negotiator, Det 1 AFRL/PKMT, Area B, Bldg 167, 2310 8th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7801 or via e-mail at michele.tritt@wpafb.af.mil by 11 January 2005 no later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.  Submittals via e-mail are preferred.  A responder may request clarification in writing for any requirement that is unclear from Anita Bailey, Contracting Officer, Det 1 AFRL/PKMT at (937) 656-7197 or by sending an e-mail to anita.bailey@wpafb.af.mil.  Technical questions regarding this sources sought announcement should be directed to Brad Sampson, AFRL/MLME at (937)-904-4321 or at brad.sampson@wpafb.af.mil.  Any requests for clarification must be received no later than seven (7) business days prior to the close of this sources sought announcement in order to receive a timely response.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All routine communications regarding this announcement should be directed to the technical or contractual points of contact listed above.  All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency.  See Note(s): 25.

<DESC>Department of the Air Force Broad Agency Announcement FY05BAA100104

A. INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Force Protection Battlelab (AFFPB) mission is to identify innovative concepts for protecting Air Force personnel, facilities and weapon systems; rapidly measure the potential for advancing Air Force core competencies; and to explore joint warfighting by using field ingenuity, modeling, simulation, and actual employment of exploratory capabilities in operational environments.  The AFFPB invites solution based quad charts with rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates that address Air Force Force Protection mission needs in the following areas:  Force Protection, Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism, and Force Health Protection. This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals. Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.” A secure website has been established to provide public access to the BAA package, collect unclassified submittals, and track classified submittals. All submitters responding to this BAA are required to register at the secure BAA Information Delivery System (BIDS) website https://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb. Click on “register” under the “account center” heading. The submitter must complete all mandatory fields on the BIDS submitter registration form. BIDS submitter registrations are automatically accepted and the acceptance e-mail will provide the registrant’s username that will be used at the BIDS website and placed in the quad charts and white papers as described in paragraph D and E below. Questions regarding BIDS may be addressed via e-mail to the BIDS help desk at bidshelp@acqcenter.com or by accessing HELP REQUEST at the bottom of the BIDS site screen. BIDS help requests shall reference FY05BAA100104.  This announcement is open through 30 September 2005.  Solution Based quad charts in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during this period. This is a two phase process: Phase 1 will be a review of quad charts submitted under this BAA; Phase 2 will be a review of five page white papers submitted at the request of the Air Force Force Protection Battlelab based on the quad chart review.  A new BAA may be posted following expiration of this submittal period in support of any additional or continuing agency needs.
 
B. OBJECTIVE:  
(1) Technical Description: This BAA solicits innovative quad charts addressing solutions to identified Air Force Force Protection needs. The Force Protection Battlelab has divided its focus into three distinct areas: force health protection, counterterrorism/antiterrorism, and force protection.  This broad agency announcement is only looking for concepts that fall within these three areas.  Submit quad charts that address:  Force Protection, Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism, and Force Health Protection Force.  
Subgroup Description	Subgroup/Requirement Designator
Force Health Protection 	FHP-100
Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism	CTAT-200
Force Protection 	FP-300

a.  Force Health Protection (FHP-100) - Force Health Protection is defined as all services performed, provided, or arranged by the Services to promote, improve, conserve, or restore the physical well-being of personnel.  The Force Health Protection subgroup focuses on concepts to improve:
§	Preventive and curative health measures; evacuation of the wounded, injured or sick; selection of the medically fit and disposition of the medically unfit
§	Blood management and immunization methodologies
§	Field expedient first aid, hemorrhage control, emergency wound treatment, management of fractures and treatment of burns
§	Processes to address injuries resulting from nuclear, biological, chemical, radiological and conventional weapons
§	Personnel training, insertion of capability at the point of need, interoperability with other service and civilian assets
§	Medical surveillance of non-battle injuries and illnesses, endemic infectious diseases and exposure to nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons or materials.
§	Methods for decontamination of personnel and equipment
§	Medical first responder communications and reachback/reachforward capabilities.  
Specific areas of interest in the area of Force Health Protection can be viewed in the Other Downloads section at https://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb. 

b.  Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism (CTAT-200) - Counterterrorism is defined as offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism.  Antiterrorism is defined as defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military forces.  While this area of interest applies to military it also focuses on solution sets that would apply to homeland security and homeland defense.  The Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism subgroup focuses on identifying concepts to improve:
§	Security of personnel, assets and facilities
§	Prevention of unauthorized access to equipment, installations, and material
§	Vulnerability assessments; command and control; training and equipment for first responders; personnel and vehicle access control; biometric identification devices
§	Law enforcement operations
§	Intelligence operations as they apply to terrorist threats.  This includes the collection, analysis, and dissemination of all forms of available intelligence.
Specific areas of interest in the area of Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism can be viewed in the Other Downloads section at https://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb.
c.  Force Protection (FP-300) - Force Protection is defined as actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against Department of Defense personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information.  These actions conserve the force's fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and place and incorporate the coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to enable the effective employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy.  The Force Protection subgroup focuses on concepts to improve:
§	Methods or tools to improve emergency response operations  
§	Methods or tools to improve explosive ordnance disposal operations, to include locating, reconnoitering, accessing, identifying, rendering safe, removing, and disposing of large and small quantities of unexploded ordnance 
§	Ability of personnel to operate in a Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment 
§	Methods or tools to increase the resistance of buildings, shelters, and areas to terrorist attacks
§	Methods or tools to improve the physical security of installations worldwide
§	Methods for the NBC agent detection, identification, and warning
Specific areas of interest in the area of Force Protection can be viewed in the Other Downloads section at https://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb.

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSC POL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and  send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c)	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC POL #215-737-7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                                     ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                                                           ].
	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                                              ].

* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                                     ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                                                           ].
	TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                                                         ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to shcedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be defereed pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

(h) 	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.

If downward price adjustments are not requested and this is later revealed through audits or otherwise, the contractor shall reimburse the Government the amount overcharged plus interest. Interest will be computed at the rate set annually by the Secretary of the Treasury for late contract payments. Interest will accrue from the date the adjustment should have been made. In computing any contract price adjustment, the most recently published index as of the date of award will be compared to the most recently published index as of the date of adjustment. No adjustment shall be made if the referenced change is less than 2%. Total upward adjustment for the contract period, including any option periods, shall not exceed 10%, based on the original or option period contract price; downward adjustments are not limited.

An overall technical rating will be established to rate the proposals according to the following: Acceptable – Offeror has to provide documented evidence of being able to understand and satisfy the requirements, thereby meeting the minimum standards.  Unacceptable – Offeror does not meet the requirement or failed to respond to the requirement.  Deficiencies require major revisions.  Probability of satisfactory performance is unlikely.  If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is judged to have very good performance risk rating; thereby representing the best value to the Government, the evaluation stops at this point.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offeror.  However, the Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a better performance risk rating than the low offeror.  FACTOR 2 – METHOD OF EVALUATION: Past Performance Assessment. The evaluation team will assess contractor past performance, specifically the quality and satisfaction rating for contracts completed within the past three years and the results of past performance surveys.  Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek performance information on the lowest priced technically acceptable offerors (usually the lowest five) based on 1) the references provided by the offeror and 2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  The Government shall not seek information on the evaluated higher priced offerors unless it is determined none of the lower priced offerors are acceptable for award.  The purpose of past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the RFQ based upon the offeror's demonstrated past and present performance.  Past performance regarding sub-contractors that will perform major aspects of the requirement will be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.  The past performance evaluation will take into consideration the most recent data available.  Similar efforts will be selected that are either just completed or still in progress.  In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ.  The assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  Each proposal evaluated at this stage will be assigned one of the following performance risk ratings.  These assessment ratings are subjective based on the past performance information collected.  The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, none, marginal, or unsatisfactory (Please complete Attachment 2 and 3).  Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating of "Neutral", meaning the rating is neither favorable nor unfavorable.  FACTOR 3 – METHOD OF EVALUATION: Price. Price shall be evaluated as complete, real, and reasonableness.  52.212-3 OFFERORS REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAY 2004); 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2003); 52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2004) (DEVIATION); 52.225-14 INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN ENGLISH VERSION AND TRANSLATION OF CONTRACT (FEB 2000); 52.232-33 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER—CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003); 52.252-5 AUTHORIZED DEVIATIONS IN PROVISIONS (APR 1984); 52.252-6 AUTHORIZED DEVIATIONS IN CLAUSES (APR 1984); 252.204-7004 REQUIRED CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION ALTERNATE A (NOV 2003); 252.212-7001 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS APPLICABLE TO DEFENSE ACQUISITIONS OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2004) (DEVIATION); 252.225-7041 CORRESPONDENCE IN ENGLISH (JUN 1997); 252.229-7003 TAX EXEMPTIONS (ITALY) (JAN 2002); 252.232-7008 ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS (OVERSEAS) (JUN 1997); 252.233-7001 CHOICE OF LAW (OVERSEAS) (JUN 1997); 5352.204-9100 COMMUNICATION SECURITY REVIEW (USAFE) (JUL 1984); 5352.225-9100 SUBMISSION OF OFFERS IN OTHER THAN UNITED STATES CURRENCY (USAFE) (APR 2002)

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

The contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale.
