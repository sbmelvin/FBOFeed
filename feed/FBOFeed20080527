<DESC>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS FOR A SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION (REFERENCE FAR PART 13.106-1(b)) AS REQUIRED BY FAR PART 5.2.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION/PROPOSAL.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of this contract action deem only one source is reasonably available.  This requirement is considered noncommercial in nature and any resultant purchase order will be awarded in accordance with FAR Part 13. The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to award a sole source Fixed Price purchase order for the development of compact LVS and SVS whole air sampling system designs, using COTS components to the maximum extent possible, to meet unique Air Force requirements, to Mechtronic Solutions, Inc (CAGE Code: 1E3G6).  Systems are intended for ground, UAV or other airborne platforms.  Required specifications include weight less than 100 lbs for LVS and 50 lbs for SVS and footprint less than 36x30x30 and 18x18x36 respectively, while still maintaining large volume capacity/sampling capability.  Systems are to be modular, scalable, reliable, rugged, and rapidly adaptable to a variety of transportation platforms. Design must be completed within 3 months or award.  It is not anticipated that any other firm could complete this requirement without a substantial duplication of costs. The majority of the required design work for this requirement was procured by the Air Force on previous contracts. It is anticipated that a competing firm would incur significantly higher costs for the design, and would not be able to complete the design in the required time frame.
Secret security clearances are required for contractor employees at time of award.   Solicitation FA2521-07-T0110 will be issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  It is advertised with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541330, with a size standard of $4.5M.   This acquisition will be conducted as a small business set-aside.  

Potential contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award (See Internet site: http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil).   It is mandatory to obtain a DUNS number prior to registering in CCR by calling Dun & Bradstreet (1-800-333-0505).  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  Any firm that believes it can meet the specifications above may give written notification to the point of contact below.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Additionally, the SLA will be reviewed to determine that support around software issues will be reviewed in a timely manner and that a 24 hour a day help desk will be made available.  Furthermore, the issue escalation path that is implemented when issues are not resolved by the initial support representative should be outlined in the SLA.  Lastly, a description of the type of software upgrades, and support for the upgrades, should be defined within the SLA.  The Agreement will also be evaluated to determine that is not in conflict with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM/OPS/SIO).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for the acquisition of the Business Objects software products and support identified in Paragraph (3) on a brand name only basis:
Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6 (a)(2) for a limited source acquisition, the use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, thereby precluding consideration of other business intelligence software products manufactured by another company.  
The Departments Bureau of Information Resource Management requires the purchase of licenses for the Business Objects Business Intelligence suite and first year support that are listed in paragraph (3).  These licenses and support are required to design, develop, and implement a pilot for the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) by November 2008.  This J&A supports the purchase of the Business Objects Business Intelligence suite on a brand name only basis.  The requirement will be competed among Business Objects resellers that have GSA Federal Schedule contracts for these software products.  The Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) is one of eight management reform initiatives reported to the Secretary that the U.S. Department of State (DoS) is currently executing.  The goal of EDW is to greatly diminish many of the challenges currently impacting the use of the Departments historical data, and to provide greater analytical ability to the end users.  This will first be accomplished by giving authorized users of the system desktop access to near real-time data.   The data warehouse will also have a Business Intelligence (BI) component integrated with it.  The BI component will present capability to run standard and ad hoc reports and will also provide tools to perform cross-cutting data analysis along with embedded user-friendly display ability.  By providing these capabilities, the EDW will turn raw data into shared knowledge thereby promoting information sharing throughout the Department.  This knowledge will in turn enhance the decision-making process, boost operating efficiency, and lower operating costs.  In essence EDW will increase the value of the Departments data set and allow the Department to have a forward and backward view of their data so that they may know what has happened, what is happening, and what is likely to happen.<BR><BR>The business intelligence software products and support listed below are required by IRM/OPS/SIO and are developed by Business Objects.  These business intelligence software products/support are available for purchase from Business Objects and Business Objects resellers.  Business Objects was recently acquired by SAP.  	50 Named User Licenses (NUL)   Web Intelligence Business Objects (BO) Premium Bundle (Production Environment)	50 Named User Licenses (NUL)   Business Objects Xcelsius Viewer (Production Environment)	10 Named User Licenses (NUL)  - Web Intelligence Business Objects Enterprise Premium Bundle (Dev/Test Environment)	10 Named User Licenses (NUL)   Business Objects Xcelsius Viewer (Dev/Test Environment)	3 Named User Licenses (NUL)  - Crystal Reports XI Professional	3 Named User Licenses (NUL)   Business Objects Xcelsius Designer	First Year Standard Technical Support	Final Deliverable to include Installation of a Functioning Product suiteProcurement of the Business Objects Business Intelligence software products and support by limiting sources to the Business Objects resellers that have GSA FSS No. 70 contracts is justified pursuant to FAR Part 8.405-6(a)(2) as follows:(a)(2) an item peculiar to one manufacturer (e.g., a particular brand name, product or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer).  
As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products/support identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Government's existing investment.  These Business Objects products are essential for meeting the aggressive schedule of this critical Department initiative.  A/LM/AQM intends to compete IRMs requirements among Business Objects resellers possessing a GSA FSS No. 70 contract.  The Office of Acquisition Management has identified at least 15 such firms, some of which are small businesses.  
Potentially, the largest benefit to utilizing Business Objects as the business intelligence tool for EDW is the fact that Business Objects already has a presence at DoS and area already in use with the systems with which IRM is integrating.  Therefore, there are areas within the Department that possess institutional knowledge around the tools, and Business Objects supports their software running on VMware virtualization software, which is a large piece of the office infrastructure.  To date, the DoS has invested significantly in Business Objects as its business intelligence technology to support multiple business applications, such as the Human Resource Knowledge Center, Global Financial Management System, Diplomatic Security and Consular Affairs applications.<BR><BR>The DoS Information Technology Change Control Boards (ITCCB) change management has already approved addition of the Business Objects Business Intelligence products to the DoS baseline.  Furthermore, Business Objects approved IT CCB software suite will enable IRM/OPS/SIO to start using the new software right away without going through the difficult process of adding the software to the baseline.  However, IRM/OPS/SIO is aware that ITCCB approval for use within the Department does not constitute an official endorsement of the product by the Department nor does it mean that it is mandated as the business intelligence product to be used.  This approval is not to be confused with standardization of a product as an authorized exception to full and open competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(4).   DoS users have been trained in the use of Business Objects with other system implementations.  Therefore, not only is the knowledge and skillset to use the tool already present in the Department, but training materials are present as well, thereby achieving a cost savings.  Additionally, as Business Objects licenses are already owned by the Department, there is potential to benefit from reduced license costs later when the same personnel who currently use Business Objects will also utilize the EDW.  From a development standpoint, there is potential to reuse the Business Objects code that has already been developed as part of the pre-existing DoS implementations. The requirement will be competed among Business Objects resellers that have GSA FSS contracts.  GSA has already determined the schedule prices to be fair and reasonable.  However, the Government intends to competitively award a delivery order to the offeror that represents the overall the best value to the Department.  Although the requirement is justified on a limited source basis, AQM will post the requirement on FedBid and will include the brand name justification with the posting as required by FAR 8.405-6(d).  The requirement will be competed on FedBid among Federal Supply Schedule No. 70 contractors in compliance with FAR 8.405-6 and AQM Memorandum 08-05.  The Department is prepared to provide the RFQ to additional firms that request copies (reference FAR 8.405-2(c)(4)).<BR><BR>

Systems Development and Maintenance (SDM) operates and maintains a Development Network (DevNet) that includes a NetApp 960 Filer that duplicates the Operational environment of Global Financial Services  Charleston.  The NetApp 960 Filer requires replacement disk drives to remain operational.  The disk drives for NetApp Filers are proprietary, specially cased to fit in the filer housing and must be stringently tested to verify maximum quality/durability.  Ordering of any NetApp components must be made through a NetApp approved reseller to retain warranty, maintenance, and support. 
The Impact of Not Requiring Brand Name
The DevNet environment must be available 24/7 to provide support to the GFS/Charleston operations.  To retain warranty, maintenance and support to the NetApp Filer, approved products are required.
Recommendation
Based on the proprietary nature of the equipment, RM recommends this one time acquisition (Brand Name Justification) of Network Appliance replacement disk drives.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Airspace is composed of a number of Air Traffic Control (ATC) and monitoring system and management facilities.   Within this system, 20 Air Traffic Control Centers located in the Continental United States (CONUS) manage the bulk of air traffic.
The Air Traffic Controllers use sector boundaries and sector traffic information to control air traffic in their respective sector(s).  The EnRoute Information Display System (ERIDS) displays that information in their monitor.  It also provides the capability to enter Pilot Reports easily for dissemination throughout the center and the electronic data to other Center operational personnel and management personnel.  The FAA intends to purchase 900 ERIDS Monitor Head Bumpers.  Air Traffic Controllers are hitting their heads on the monitors and the Monitor Head Bumpers will be installed on the ERIDS controller displays as a safety measurement.  
Each unit is 3 inches X 3 inches X 12 inches, has a steel skeleton for attachment to the monitors and is covered with soft gray foam.  
Interested parties who can meet this requirement called for in this announcement must respond by 4 p.m., local time on May 30, 2008 via email to jeanine.passetti@faa.gov

<DESC>It is the intent of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Targets and Countermeasures Program Office, Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal 35898, to negotiate on a sole source basis with Orbital Sciences Corporation, 3380 S. Price Road Chandler, AZ 85248.  The proposed acquisition is directed to Orbital Sciences Corporation pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302.1, 'only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.'  The proposed acquisition will require the contractor to provide a maximum quantity of one (1) Medium Range Target (MRT) System for mission Japanese Flight Test Mission (JFTM)-3 with a priced option for an additional MRT in support of JFTM-4.  Both the basic and option activities will include related target vehicle integration activities and Mission/Launch Support and Execution to be conducted at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF).  The JMSDF (Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force) is conducting a series of Aegis Class Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) tests that require targets with consistent mission to mission characteristics and threat representations.  JFTM-3 and JFTM-4 are the next two missions in this series.  The JMSDF flew JFTM-1 in December 2007 with a configuration that is no longer available.  The JMSDF have requested a Castor IVB MRT with a configuration that would be consistent with the original in order to maintain consistency across the series of Aegis BMDS tests.  Orbital Sciences Corporation designed and built the original MRT and can provide the configuration that meets the consistency requirement.  The contractor has all the necessary design, engineering, manufacturing, software, integration, and mission execution expertise.  No other contractor fabricates the necessary configuration and integrates this vehicle or an equivalent medium range vehicle that satisfies the consistency requirement against JFTM-1 within budget and schedule constraints.     See note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with Ultra Electronics BCF, Cirencester, United Kingdom.  The Government intends to procure interface cable/adapter sets to be used with the TTU-597/E Fuel Quantity Test Set (FQTS) under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, as BCF is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and sole source designer, manufacturer, and integrator of the FQTS at this time.  The FQTS is a portable test set used to test fuel quantity probes and indicators of various Navy and Marine Corps aircraft to verify that aircraft fuel quantity gauges are indicating correct fuel levels.  BCF is currently under contract with the U.S. Navy to produce 604 test sets and integrate the FQTS to support the current fleet of aircraft.  The Government does not currently possess the data necessary to provide for the production and integration of the interface cable/adapter sets; therefore Ultra Electronics BCF is the only source who can accomplish the requirement in the necessary timeframe as the OEM would be able to work on the FQTS platform integration and production cable/adapter sets concurrently.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the government will consider all responses received to this notice.  A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<SUBJECT>Development of Marine Composite Propeller Technology
<SOLNBR>ONRBAA08-017
<RESPDATE>070908
<CONTACT>Susan K. Parrott, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 696-1356, Email parrots@onr.navy.mil - Matthew Ferebee, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-1474, Email matthew.ferebee@navy.mil
<DESC>Most commercial and naval vessels employ metallic propellers. The most popular materials are a nickel-aluminum-bronze (NAB) alloy and stainless steel.  In the small-boat industry, composite propellers are becoming increasingly popular over metallic propellers due to their light weight, relatively low cost, and maintenance advantages. Composite propellers for large vessels require significant developmental efforts in many areas, particularly in the manufacturing area. Although composite materials are used heavily in the aerospace and the wind turbine industries, the development in the marine industry has been slow primarily due to technical difficulties associated with the in-water operating environment and smaller market size.  

The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is initiating the development of marine composite propeller technology for applications to large ships and submerged vehicles. The objective of the program is to develop and demonstrate composite marine propeller technology that can achieve benefits such as reduced weight, reduced life-cycle cost and reduced maintenance needs, as well as some perceived benefits for naval applications. Under this BAA, ONR is soliciting proposals for the development of composite marine propeller technology in a building-block approach, starting from small-scale and progressively increasing size to large- and full-scale prototypes.

Traditional propellers are rigid. Though the rigid propellers may deflect under load, the pitch of the propeller does not change when the blade is loaded. One advantage of composite materials is the ability to tailor the structure for improved performance.  A composite propeller with blades structurally tailored in such a way that the blade tip is passively deformed through bend/twist coupling in response to the onset flow is expected to provide improved efficiency and other performance. This kind of propeller is called a pitch-adapting propeller.

The objective of this program is to develop, demonstrate and transition composite propeller technology for applications to naval ships and submerged vehicles. Two types of composite propellers will be developed under this program: rigid and pitch-adapting. 

The program will consist of three phases. The first phase will have up to three vendors. The purpose of the first phase is to evaluate the vendor's structural design and manufacturing capabilities. The second phase will have up to two vendors and use a building block approach to develop the structural design and manufacturing capabilities for the unique geometries involved in propeller manufacture. The third phase will have up to two vendors and focus on structural design and manufacture of propellers at large scale. 

All phases will have Classified and Unclassified structural design components. The manufacturing process in the first phase will be Unclassified. The manufacturing process in the subsequent phases will be Classified.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Description
The Space Innovation and Development Center (SIDC) is hereby issuing this announcement for continued support to the Aerospace Fusion Center (AFC) Operations and Maintenance Support and other in-scope Research & Development efforts.  Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems (NGES), 1100 West Hollyvale Street, Azusa, California 91702, is currently performing this effort under the Rapid Prototyping, Integration, and Development (RaPID) Contract, FA2550-04-C-3008.  The current AFC contractual coverage ends on 30 Sep 2008 and is being performed on a sole-source basis.  To maintain continuity for future AFC requirements, a basic year of contract support with four one-year options for this continued support is anticipated.  The requirement consists of seamlessly extending support for AFC and its customers by supporting the center?s operational software, the Space Awareness and Global Exploitation (SAGE) system, the Static Infrared Emitter (SIRE) processor, SAGE client displays, and affiliated hardware, software, crypto, and communications lines.  This also involves using SAGE to analyze events in both real-time and playback mode; integrating and tuning of advanced Overhead Non-Imaging InfraRed (ONIR) fusion algorithms in SAGE; providing operational performance assessment; incorporating mission performance improvements on SAGE; and system administration functions.  Although the facility is staffed on a 5-day per week, 8 hour schedule, the SAGE system and SIRE processor operate on a 24/7 basis, and the capability must exist to respond within 2 hours of hardware or software failure.  In event of contingencies or schedule conflicts, the AFC can be staffed 24/7 for a limited period of time.  The AFC is a development facility located in the Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center (MDIOC) at Schriever AFB CO.  The contractor personnel who perform the operations and maintenance portion of the AFC are required to have current Top Secret/Secure Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) security clearances and must qualify for clearance to the appropriate program level.  NGES is the manufacturer of the Defense Satellite Program (DSP) sensor and developer of the AFC?s software suite which includes the SAGE system, the SIRE processor, the Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) Automatic Track Transfer processor, Missile Defense Agency?s (MDA?s) External Sensors Lab (ESL) algorithms, New Foreign Launch-Prototype algorithm, and Walker algorithms.  In addition, NGES has access to raw satellite data critical to the AFC?s functions and dedicated communication lines to deliver that data into the AFC.  The contractor must be capable of providing information to the AFC via communication lines at a minimum rate of 9 MB/sec of data transfer.  Facilities that replicate the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Mission Control Station (MCS) to include actual SBIRS hardware, software, and real-time data feeds are also required.  The contractor must also be able to seamlessly and quickly take over the troubleshooting and development of the SAGE system, the SIRE processor, the HEO Automatic Track Transfer processor, the fusion of classified ONIR data sources in real-time into SAGE, and continue development and support of the MDA?s ESL missile defense algorithms for state vector improvement.  The contractor must also possess the expertise to fuse all DoD ONIR satellites in SAGE in real-time and be able to perform the operations and maintenance of SAGE servers and client workstations running at the AFC and at the AFC?s customer locations.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for performing aSpace Network Ground Systems (SNGS) Architecture Concept Study.  The Space Network (SN)Modernization Project, located at the NASA GSFC, is beginning preliminary planning forthe modernization of the existing SNGS located at Las Cruces, NM and at Guam, a U.S.territory.  Overview:The SN consists of a space segment, Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS), and aground segment, SNGS.  The SN provides the capability for global space-to-groundtelecommunications and tracking coverage for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and near earth spaceflight missions, including both scientific and human space flight.  The functional objectives of the SNGS are:1.  Maintain health, safety, and control of all TDRS spacecraft.2.  Relay customer signals in forward and return directions    between the grounddemarcation points for NISN services or Local Interfaces and customer spacecraft via theTDRS with a very high figure of availability that provides for extremely high operationalproficiency.3.  Provide tracking services for TDRS and customer spacecraft.4.  Provide SN customers with service planning, scheduling, and status & control ofactive supports. 5.  Provide for the ability to operate, maintain, and sustain the flight and groundsegments.6.  Provide for testing, monitoring and fault isolation of the SN assets and systems.More information about the SN can be found at:http://scp.gsfc.nasa.gov/sn/index.htm	Background:The SNGS has been evolving since the last significant modernization effort completed inthe middle 1990s.  The SNGS has been expanded, and modified to support an evolvingcustomer base while maintaining the fundamental architecture created by the lastmodernization project.	The SN Modernization Project is beginning preliminary planningfor the modernization of the existing SNGS to address issues associated withobsolescence, create a more flexible and organic architecture to address evolvingcustomer requirements and advances in technology, to implement new methods andcapabilities for using the TDRS to support customer spacecraft, to expand and improve themethods by which customer control centers interface with the SNGS for data and serviceplanning and control, and to improve long term operational performance andmaintainability.Approach:In order to improve the SN Modernization Project efforts to plan for the modernization ofthe SNGS, NASA is seeking innovative and transformational replacement architectureconcepts for the SNGS that meet the functional objectives and address the issues andgoals outlined above.  The NASA SN Modernization Project is planning to execute a SNGSArchitecture Concept Study procurement to seek the best ideas and concepts from industry. It is expected that the study will generate new architecture concepts for the SNGS whileaddressing the technical readiness level of the components necessary to implement thearchitecture.  An associated description for the concept of operations for thisarchitecture will need to be included, along with risks, issues, and descriptions of anytechnology investments necessary to implement the architecture.  It is anticipated thatmultiple Architectural Concept Studies may be awarded. The study will describe the facility needs for the new system (power, cooling, squarefootage, etc.).  The study will not need to address the modification of the power,cooling, or square footage of the existing facilities.	It is expected that the newsystems will be developed, integrated and tested at a location geographically separatedfrom WSC.  The new systems will then be installed and transitioned into operations at theNASA facilities in Las Cruces, NM, and Guam.  It is anticipated that the mechanicalcomponents of the existing Space to Ground Link antennas at those facilities would beretained; however, all other RF components and support systems are under considerationfor replacement in the architecture. A specific Statement of Work and list ofdeliverables will be provided with the study RFP, these are expected to include anarchitecture concept, companion operations concept, and describe the estimated effort andtimeline for the implementation of the approach.The contractor(s) will provide the personnel, materials, and facilities necessary tocomplete the study. The contractor(s) will need to have expert knowledge and experienceof the principles and practices related to complex satellite communications, withknowledge of the SN in particular.  The contractor(s) will need expert knowledge andexperience in numerous areas including ground system and subsystem architectures,state-of-the-art digital modulation/demodulation techniques and coding schemes, RFamplification, filtering, timing systems, signal combining methods, distortionsensitivities, etc., and the commercial availability of these items in the marketplace.The contractor(s) will need relevant experience and the use of appropriate analyticaltoolsets and modeling.	Further, the contractor(s) will need expert knowledge in softwaredesign for complex and high reliability software systems, and the use of appropriatemodeling techniques to predict complexity, size, effort, and schedule for development. Knowledge of appropriate commercially available products will be necessary. Other Information:No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought is to identify hotels willing to provide meeting space, lodging, and meals in the Los Angeles, California area, in light of new guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs.

Two of the new requirements prescribe limits for meals and refreshments served at breaks.  Regarding meals, the new guideline states that the cost of any meal provided, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 150 percent of the locality M&IE per meal. For example, if breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $64.00 per day meal incidental expense M&IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $12.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $18.00 ($12.00 X 150%) per person.  

If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $64.00 per day meal incidental expense M&IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $18.00 per lunch. Therefore, the cost of the lunch provided at the conference cannot exceed $27.00 ($18.00 X 150%) per person.  

The new guideline defines refreshments as light food and drinks served at breaks and include such items as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins.  Under the new guidelines the cost of these items, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 23 percent of the locality (M&IE) for both morning and afternoon breaks.  For the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area, the M&IE rate is $64.00 per person. Therefore, the cost of the refreshments cannot exceed $14.72 ($64.00 X 23%) per person per day.

Any hotel source interested and capable of providing lodging at the Federal per diem rates and meeting the new guideline requirements should submit a statement of capabilities, to include sleeping and meeting capacity, floor charts, and food and beverage menus, to the point of contact identified.  The food and beverage menus should support the pricing mentioned above, including hotel service costs: breakfast, $18.00 per person; lunch, $27.00 per person; and refreshments for both morning and afternoon breaks, $14.72 per person.

<DESC><p>Qualified Waste Maintenance Contractor sources are being sought by 39 CONS whom have an interest in participating in a Performance Contract that is associated with performing lead removal service at a Combat Arms Training &amp; Maintenance (CATM) facility on Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. More specifically, the maintenance needed revolve around the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Contractor shall conduct cleaning and maintenance of CATM bullet trap, as describe below, on the last duty-day of every month. If the last calendar day of the month falls on a weekend day, then the last duty day would normally be on a Friday. However, Fridays are often down days for the US Air Force, in which case, the last duty day would be a Thursday. The contract will have only 8.5 hours (0800 to 1630) on the last duty-day of the month to accomplish all of the items in this statement of work.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Contractor shall provide fork lift, pallet jack, truck, one spare wooden pallet for 55 gal drums to sit on, one approved spare 55 gal. drum (with seal and cover), and a lockable weather-proof storage cabinet for storage of two bags of dolomite and other spare parts and tools needed to maintain the CATM bullet trap. The contractor will provide the User with one copy of the storage cabinet key. The wooden pallet shall be sturdy enough to handle the considerable weight of the drums. Removed drums will need approved seals and lids for transport. Spare drums, pallets, and a pallet jack shall be on site so the change out would require less than 10-15 minutes of work and range would be operational. Drums should be changed between 1/2 to 2/3 full levels or as local weight limits may restrict transportation. This will be between 1500 and 2000 kg at these levels. If permitted to fill more, may exceed drum and lifting capabilities. Spare drums must be stored empty on-site in plastic hazardous waste accumulation point (PIG). No full drums (i.e. 1/2 to 2/3 full) will be allowed to be stored on site. Full drums must be disposed of immediately, and returned to the CATM range with one week.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Contractor shall purchase and provide twelve Donaldson Torit filter cartridges per year for the Dust Collection Unit (DCU Model #: DFT2-12, Serial #: 2283945-1). The DCU manufacturer's web site is: http://www.donaldson.com/en/industrialair/index.html. Installation and Operation Manuals, Spare Parts Lists, etc. can be found on the web site. There are 6 ports and the filters are placed 2 deep into each port. Contractor shall monitor with Action Target customer service technician via phone on a quarterly basis the service /operations logs (specifically photohelic readings). Anticipation of any need for replacement filters should be able to be identified with months of anticipation. When the dial on the control gauge reaches 5, the filters need to be changed. Individual filters can weigh up to 140 kg, when full. They must be put into OSHA-approved bags and containers immediately, and readied for transport to the disposal facility. The contractor must also provide two 50 kg bags of dolomite per year to be deposited by hand approximately 75kg of dolomite from bottom of DCU, while DCU is operating. Compressor should be turned off and left in off position, until the needle on the control gauge reaches 3 (approximately two months). Once the compressor is turned on, it should not be turned off until the next filter replacement. Operation of the compressor before the needle reaches three will blow the dolomite off the filters, and compromise their effectiveness.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with Wolters Kluwer Health Inc, on a sole source basis, to publish a special November 2008 health disparity issue.  The issue will be part of the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice (JPHMP) and the topics will be coordinated by the Office of Minority health (OMH).  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  The anticipated contract period will be from the date of award through November 2008.  This procurement is under the Simplified Acquisition threshold and will be awarded as a Simplified Acquisition.    

The purpose of this requirement is to disseminate information to the practice community on best practices that could be helpful to them in translating knowledge into actions that result in the elimination of disparities regarding minority health.  

Wolters Kluwer Health Inc is considered the sole source for satisfying this requirement because they are the publisher of the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice (JPHMP).  This journal is the only source to publish this information because it is a very specialized, peer reviewed journal that can offer insight and pertinent information on minority health.  It is ranked as the leading publication utilized by the public health practice community. 

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as articulated above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation document is available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements should be submitted by 5 pm June 11, 2008 to keith.austin@psc.hhs.gov.

<DESC>The Real Estate, Design and Construction, in Region 4 of Public Buildings Services of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is announcing its intent to complete the design of the new Federal Building and Courthouse in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, by retaining the Bridging Architect, Hammond Beeby Rupert Ainge Architects, using other than full-and-open competition, as regulated in Part 6.3 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation System.  The delivery method has been changed from Design-Build-Bridging to Construction Manager as-Constructor (CMc).  Using the CMc delivery method, GSA is requiring that a 100-percent complete set of construction documents be developed prior to construction award and intends to retain Hammond Beeby Rupert Ainge Architects to complete such design.  The design services of the Bridging Architect were procured under the Brooks Act as delineated in Part 36 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation System.  The Bridging Architect also was selected through the GSA Design Excellence Program.  The Bridging Architect has completed the design to approximately 65 percent.

The project has suffered an indefinite delay since it did not receive additional construction funding needed to award and initiate construction in FY09.  It is unknown at this time when the additional construction funding will be received, so GSA has determined that the best course of action for the project is to complete the design phase.  There are no additional design funds available to supplement the FY04 appropriations.

Retaining the Bridging Architect to complete the design will result in schedule efficiencies in completing the design.  By leveraging resources currently under contract, there will be no lag between completing the bridging design and starting production of the construction documents.  This approach also will eliminate inefficiencies associated with incorporating another design team into the project team, such as reviewing and accepting the bridging design, and becoming familiar with the site, design constraints, project schedule, and organization of the project team.

Should a party other than the Bridging Architect perform the remaining design effort, the party responsible for completion of the design shall deliver a 100-percent complete set of construction documents within the established construction budget of $43.5M, while also maintaining the design integrity, style and detailing of the bridging design.  The design must continue to reflect the successful integration of a new public building into an existing traditional context which has taken into consideration master planning constraints.  Any changes to meet the estimated construction budget must be minimal since this design has been presented to and approved by the Commissioner of GSA.  Additional concurrences with the City of Tuscaloosa, which is donating the site, have been attained based on this design.  The completed design must meet all applicable federal, state and local guidelines governing this design including, but not limited to, the following: P100-Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service; Interagency Security Criteria; U.S. Courts Design Guide; U.S. Marshals Service Design Requirements; and, Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards.  Building Information Modeling must used by through the completion of design and LEED criteria must be ensured.  And Doctor Checks Design Review and Checking System is required for all submittal reviews.

Should a party other than the Bridging Architect perform the remaining design effort, that party will be required to perform a complete review of the bridging design and must accept liability for such design.  Such party also shall be responsible for completing the design and sealing the construction documents.  GSA will rely on the Bridging Architect to remain involved in the design effort as a consultant to GSA to ensure that the design intent is met through completion of design and construction.  The party performing the remaining design effort also must successfully demonstrate the ability to meet criteria, which includes and is not limited to, the following:

1.Provide evidence of architectural and engineering licensing and demonstrate the capacity to complete the construction documents.

2.Demonstrate a detailed understanding of federal, state and local regulations governing this design which includes, and is not limited to, GSAs and client agencys unique design criteria such as P100-Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service; GSA Interagency Security Criteria; U.S. Courts Design Guide; U.S. Marshals Service Design Requirements, and Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards.

3.Provide evidence of design experience for a minimum of 2 new construction projects within the past 5 years with construction costs of over $40 million each.

4.Provide evidence of design experience for a minimum of 2 new construction projects within the past 5 years that used the Construction Manager as-Constructor or Construction Manager at-Risk project delivery method.

5.Provide evidence of design experience for new construction project(s) that reflect an understanding of Greek classical references.

6.Provide evidence of design experience within the past 5 years for buildings that accommodate justice and law enforcement functions.

7.Provide evidence of design experience for a minimum of 2 new construction projects within the past 5 years that meet guidelines within the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and GSAs Metric Design Guide.

8.Provide evidence of design experience for new construction project(s) within the past 5 years that incorporated cost-effective and innovative strategies to meet the guidelines within the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT).

9.Provide evidence of design experience on a minimum of 2 new construction projects within the past 5 years that used sustainable design and construction practices to attain LEED Certification.

10.Provide evidence of design experience for new construction within the past 5 years that incorporates Total Building Commissioning, as defined by GSAs Building Commissioning Guide.

11.Provide evidence of design experience for new construction within the past 5 years that successfully used Building Information Modeling throughout the design process.

12.Provide evidence of design experience for new construction within the past 5 years that met a 35 percent level-of-contract-effort performed within the state such project was located.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT RESULT IN AN ORDER AGAINST AN FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE. ANY OFFER WHICH IS PREDICATED UPON THE AWARD BEING PLACED AGAINST AN FSS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.</p>
<p><br />NAICS: 333298<br />SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD: 500 employees</p>
<p>The purchase of Aqueous Cleaning System, Model #F-4000-X-P, 1 each, made of stainless steel that is 63"x72"x92" in size. It should be a purifier system that cleans parts. System needs to be front loading, automated, and designed to clean a variety of parts in the LANTIRN area.</p>
<p>Price(s) should be FOB Destination (Robins AFB GA 31098). In additional to price and delivery, quote should include your cage code, DUNS number, and taxpayer ID number. Requested delivery date is 30 days ARO.</p>
<p>Justification for Brand Name Only : The aqueous cleaner stated above is the only known equipment that meets our requirements for cleaning sensitive avionic components which requires removing PAO (Polyolefin synthetic hydrocarbon) without harming the asset. The F-4000-LX-P has a unique user friendly filter remoal system (5 featured Purifier Filtration) which extends the equipment life. Without this cleaner, production will cease, impacting the ability of the dpot to support portions of the AAQ-13, AAQ-14, and the APN-59 Avionics system worked in the 566 EMXS.</p>
<p>The F-4000-LX-P is the only known brand to supply consistent spray (without immersion) throughout the cleaning area (with 25 nozzles) within the cleaning system. This product is currently established on base and are used throughout the maintenance directorates. The detergent (PDN-50) used and specifically made for this machine has proven to remove the oil base contaminates on our assets.</p>
<p>For safety and VPP (Voluntary Protection Program) reasons we require F-4000-LX-P due to its front loading design, turntable load capacity of 1500 lbs., sealed chamber, automated timer system, non solvent based (very green), and digital control. Other functional requirements are as follows: no abrasive media is used, oil skimming wheel, steam exhaust blower, air drying system, in line bag filter with 200 gpm rating, and hand brush option. This cleaner is also required due to the fact that the current cleaning system is being demolished in a current construction project and no other means of aqueous cleaning is available. This particular model will automate and improve our throughput of assets so that the production process is optimized.</p>
<p>The following clauses (current through FAC 2005-23 dated 26 Dec 07 and DFARS Change Notice 20070913) are applicable to subject solicitation: <br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors<br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items <br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52-212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7000<br />DFARS 252.211-7003 (Item Identification and Valuation)</p>
<p>In accordance with Clause 52.212-2, the evaluation factors shall be price and price related factors.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 52.212-3, Reps/Certs should be completed on-line at www.bpn.gov. <br />Oral procedures will be used for this solicitation.</p>
<p>Quotations may be faxed to 478-926-7549 or email duoc.vo@robins.af.mil no later than 02 Jun 08, 4:00 pm EST.</p>
<p>The anticipated award date will be by 06 Jun 08</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. .  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-25.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

NIST has a requirement for a laser with output wavelength within the range of 1549.374 nm to 1550.369 nm.  Its frequency will be locked to a resonance of a Fabry-Perot cavity used in a calculable capacitor.  Another laser, already in our possession, will be locked to a nearby (possibly adjacent) cavity resonance.  By accurately measuring the difference in the optical frequencies of these two lasers, we will make a very accurate measurement of the length of the Fabry-Perot cavity.  This, in turn, will be related to a calculated value of capacitance.  

The laser will be used to couple into a variable-length Fabry-Perot cavity whose length will be in the range of 100 mm to 200 mm.  The laser must have a linewidth comparable to that of the laser that we already have.  It must be able to be tuned to a cavity mode and allow fast frequency control to lock the laser frequency to the cavity mode.  Amplitude noise should be low.

The laser must have a tuning range of at least 20 GHz, with no gaps in tunability over this range.  Since tuning will take place inside a control loop, an electronic tuning input must be available (software tuning alone, or control from a knob, is not adequate).  The laser must have fast tuning ability with a range of at least 150 MHz.  Our existing laser has a linewidth of 1 kHz.  Consequently the laser linewidth must be no greater than 1 kHz.


**All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following line item:

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Tunable Laser, which shall meet or exceed the following specifications:

(1) The wavelength must be continuously tunable with some part of the tuning range between 1549.374 nm and 1550.369 nm;

(2) The laser linewidth must be 1 kHz or below;

(3) The laser must have a "slow" tuning range of at least 20 GHz, with no gaps in tunability over this range.  "Slow" tuning is usually accomplished by temperature.  This tuning ability must be in the form of an electronic input;

(4) The laser must have "fast" tuning ability with a range of at least 150 MHz.  "Fast" tuning is usually accomplished by means of a piezoelectric actuator.  Again, an electronic input must be provided.  The bandwidth of this control must be at least 20 kHz;

(5) Optical power output: At least 25 mW; and

(6)  The laser output must be linearly polarized and provided by a single-mode, polarization-maintaining fiber.

***The Contractor shall provide a minimum of a one (1) year warranty to cover parts and labor for the instrumentation. *** 

***Delivery shall be completed not later than 10 weeks after receipt of an order and shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. ***

*** Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, and price shall be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," and 2) Price.  Technical capability and price shall be of equal importance.   

Technical Evaluation:

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include product literature, which addresses all specifications & clearly documents that the product offered meets or exceeds the specifications identified herein. The Government would prefer an instrument that offers a greater tuning range (fast or slow), lower amplitude noise (often called RIN, for Residual Intensity Noise), greater control bandwith, and smaller linewidth.

<DESC>The Intramural Research Center, National Institute on Aging, NIH, Laboratory of Experimental Gerontology intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Darwin Chamber Company, St. Louis, MO for the following:  Laboratory incubator, 56 cubic feet, exceptionally quiet, solid state thermoelectric cooling. Cooling method utilizes solid state design, with no moving parts other than fans, for exceptional reliability, efficiency, and user serviceability.  Possibility of leaks or malfunction due to corrosion is entirely eliminated.  Other benefits include lowered vibration and noise levels  our insect-rearing chambers are far less prone to vibration that refrigeration-based systems. Temperature Range of 18 degrees to 60 degrees Celsius.  Control of temperature at sensor of plus or minus 0.2 degrees C. Uniformity inside chamber of plus or minus 1 degree C.  Standard microprocessor controller with PID, auto- tuning, programmable hi/lo alarms, ability to ramp-soak (for diurnal simulation), sensor calibration, dual display of actual and set point temperature.  Construction: all 304 series stainless steel exterior and interior, floor with coved corners.  Construction of liner in accordance with NSF standards.  Standard  with two swinging, solid, polyurethane-insulated doors with key lock.  Six open wire type shelves, adjustable. One (approximately 2 to 2-1/2 diameter) insulated access port.  Casters included. 9power cord included. Operation Manual included, #IN056  - quantity 3 each;
Microprocessor-Controlled ultrasonic Humidification. Low voltage, zero heat-producing, ultrasonic humidity generation for IN series chamber above, priced per chamber.  Humidifier is mounted in the interior of unit for simple  
Maintenance.  Controls humidity to plus or minus 0.2% RH at sensor.  Solid state control with settable alarms and delay functions.  Controller similar in almost all respects to temperature controller.  Sensor produced by Rotronic, #HUM1  quantity 3 each;  Electromechanical time clock-controller interior lighting, as specified (one per door, T8, 32 watt, 48 florescent lamp mounted vertically inside each door (insect-rearing configuration), #LTG2  quantity 3 each; Additional chrome shelf for 56 cu ft chamber, #SH56CA  quantity 6 each; Internal GFCI outlet, #GFCI  quantity 3 each; shipping and handling charges.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because Darwin Chambers Company is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  The Functional Genomics Unit of the Laboratory of Experimental Gerontology is using the fruit fly as the model organisms to study aging and aging interventions.  It is essential to maintaining highly stable environment with adjustable temperature, humidity and light/dark cycle for culturing flies.  The equipments from the Darwin Chamber Company meet our specifications for the fly work in the Biomedical Research Center (BRC).   The chambers from the Darwin Chamber Company feature quite thermoelectric cooling.  This cooling method utilizes solid state design, with no moving parts other than fans, for reliability, efficiency and user serviceability.  The possibility of leaks or malfunction due to corrosion causes by the fly culture should be entirely eliminated.  This level of corrosion resistance is not found in incubators from other vendors. Other benefits of these chambers include lowered vibration and noise levels  these insect rearing chambers are far less prone to vibration than refrigeration-based systems.  This will significantly reduce the impact of vibration in the BRC on the fly culture.  The efficiency of these insect-rearing chambers adds the benefit of significantly reducing total cost of service.  Not only is the elimination of refrigerant more environmentally friendly, thermoelectric cooling naturally requires less maintenance and repair.  In addition, the chambers require less energy to operate and the humidification system uses water more efficiently, by generating vapor, rather than droplets of water  eliminating the need for water recirculation and potential for buildup of contaminates in the water supply.  This frees us from having to repeatedly purchase filters, or additives that could affect water PH levels.  Moreover, these chambers use standard 120V outlets.  The water system, light/dark control feature and outlets dramatically reduce the requirements to renovate a lab space to house the incubators compared to similar products from other vendors.  The period of performance is approximately 6 weeks ARO.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code is 423450 and the size standard is 500.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest priced, technically acceptable vendor.

<p>The following provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (NOV 2007) with addenda as follows:</p>
<p>The vendor shall submit their quote in two (2) sections: Technical Solution and Price. The two sections shall be submitted electronically to Melissa R. Sampson at melissa.r.sampson@noaa.gov. <br /><br />Vendors are required to submit a Technical Solution which will be used to assess the vendor's capability to perform the requirements shown above. The solution shall clearly demonstrate that the vendor has a thorough understanding of the effort called for herein.</p>
<p>Vendors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their experience and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the solution; as such, solutions must be fully self-sufficient and provide all necessary information for a comprehensive evaluation. Solutions must be sufficient to show how the vendor proposes to accomplish the effort described above.</p>
<p>The following sections of material shall be submitted: <br /><br />Section I - Technical Solution</p>
<p>Technical Solution -shall include all information required for evaluation, excluding any reference to price. The technical section shall be subdivided into the following factors:</p>
<p>Technical Approach<br />Past Performance</p>
<p>Section II - Price Quote</p>
<p>Price Quote</p>
<p>SECTION I - TECHNICAL SOLUTION</p>
<p>A. Technical Approach</p>
<p>Vendors should clearly describe their understanding of what is required under this RFQ. The technical approach should address requirements in sufficient detail to determine the Vendor's understanding of the requirements described above. If subcontractors are proposed the technical approach should include a discussion of how they will be utilized so as to explain any possible impacts on performance. The vendor shall submit information in any format the vendor deems relevant for the NOAA to understand and evaluate the following areas:</p>
<p>a. Describe in detail the radar system being offered as to clearly demonstrate that the offered product meets the salient characteristics identified above and that the offered systems meet U.S. Coast Guard Type approval and IMO and IEC requirements.</p>
<p>b. Describe in detail the radar installation inspection and commissioning process that will take place during sea trials.</p>
<p>c. Provide a brochure/product literature of the system being offered.</p>
<p>B. Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors shall describe relevant performance on other contracts or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance. List a minimum of three (3) current/previous contracts similar in size, content, and complexity to the effort of this RFQ. The Government is looking for past performance involving successful use of the radar system offered. Information shall include: contract number, name and address of the Government agency or commercial entity, point of contact with current phone number, date of contract award, and period of performance, and initial and current contract value. The requested past performance shall not be older than 5 years. The Government reserves the right to contact any government and private source in addition to those included with the quote.</p>
<p>SECTION II - PRICE QUOTE</p>
<p>The vendor shall provide pricing information in a table format.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212 -2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999) <br />This clause has been tailored to this procurement:</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for Items 0001-0005 including the optional items 0001A -0005A.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single purchase order resulting from this Request for Quote to the responsible vendor whose offer conforming to the Request for Quote will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government intends to make award without discussion. The determination of greatest value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the technical factors with the differences in the prices proposed. The technical evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve only slightly superior performance capability. The Government will make this assessment through the development of trade-off analyses that involve the assessment of benefits of superior performance capability versus any added costs. As non-price factors approach equality, price as an evaluation factor becomes increasingly more important. The degree of equality between vendor's proposals will be measured by the quantity, significance, and applicability of the superior features offered.<br /><br />The quote shall be evaluated on the criteria listed below:</p>
<p>SECTION I - TECHNICAL SOLUTION</p>
<p>The technical factors, listed in descending order of importance, when combined are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>A. TECHNICAL APPROACH</p>
<p>In accordance with 52.212-1 above, quotes will be evaluated on the information contained in the technical approach that demonstrates the degree of understanding by the vendor of the requirements. Of particular importance, regarding evaluation is how the vendor addresses the areas identified in the Instructions to Offerors, paragraph a-c.</p>
<p>B. PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>In accordance with the "Instructions to Offerors" above, quotes will be evaluated on the vendor's demonstrated relevant past performance or affirmative statement that it possesses no relevant or no past performance. Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts (within the past 5 years) that is of the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is described in the solicitation. This information will be used to assess the contractor's past performance history.</p>
<p>SECTION II - PRICE QUOTE</p>
<p>While the price is not the most important evaluation factor, its importance in this procurement will not be overlooked. The degree of its importance will increase commensurately with the degree of equality among technical solutions.</p>

Yes<BR><BR>Q: Is it okay if we change the 18" deep work surfaces to 24" deep work surface?On the design it shows 18" but with an overhead that leaves limited space.Most overheads are at least 12 inches deep. 
A: Customer- No, space is at a premium, so surfaces must remain 18". 2 ea 30" worksurfaces were specified instead of 1-60" because it allows for versatility.  If space is needed for something other than worksurface, 30"of space would be freed up by removing one of the worksurfaces. 24" worksurfaces are specified for day to day work.   
Q: Why does the design use two 30" wide work-surfaces instead of a 60" wide work-surface? 
A: Customer - Furniture must be purchased in sizes that can easily be reconfigured in existing space, if needed.It is much easier to reconfigure 30" instead of 60"<BR><BR>

This pre-solicitation notice requests information from prospective offerors allowing the BTF/ITEC4 evaluation team to determine the likelihood of each respondents ability to provide the services and supplies needed to fulfill the BTFs BOSS-R requirements.  Based on an evaluation of each prospective offerors response to this notice, the firm will be notified as to whether they are considered a viable competitor for the BOSS-R contract.  Notification of a prospective offerors non viability is advisory, and offerors so notified can submit proposals to the RFP should they elect to do so.  <BR>The authority and basis for conducting the Advisory Multi-Step process is contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202.  The FAR describes the process as follows:<BR><BR>15.202 Advisory Multi-Step Process. <BR>(a) The agency may publish a pre-solicitation notice (see 5.204) that provides a general description of the scope or purpose of the acquisition and invites potential offerors to submit information that allows the Government to advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors. The pre-solicitation notice should identify the information that must be submitted and the criteria that will be used in making the initial evaluation. Information sought may be limited to a statement of qualifications and other appropriate information (e.g., proposed technical concept, past performance, and limited pricing information). At a minimum, the notice shall contain sufficient information to permit a potential offeror to make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition. This process should not be used for multi-step acquisitions where it would result in offerors being required to submit identical information in response to the notice and in response to the initial step of the acquisition. <BR>(b) The agency shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in the notice, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The agency shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The agency shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.<BR><BR>2.  Introduction <BR>The Biometrics Task Force (BTF), in coordination with the Information Technology, E-Commerce, and Commercial Contracting Center (ITEC4), is seeking qualified offerors to support the DoD Biometrics Program. <BR><BR>The Army is seeking offerors who are willing to partner with the Army to meet its mission.  The Biometrics Task Force (BTF), as per DoD Directive 8521 01E serves to act as the DoD proponent for biometrics, providing biometrics research, technology, and information management support to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Combatant Commanders, the Military Services, the Defense Agencies, and other DoD Field Activities, as required.  As such it:<BR>1) Provides for the standardization of biometric data formats, technical interfaces, conformance methodologies, performance evaluations, and other related areas to permit interoperability, both internal and external to the DoD.<BR>2) Develops and maintain the policy, processes, and procedures for the collection, processing, transmission, archiving, caching, and tagging of biometrics data and associated intelligence.<BR>3) Develops the DoD Biometrics vision and strategy, in concert with the Military Services, Joint Staff, and Office of the Secretary of Defense.<BR>4) Provides a means for unified acquisition and procurement of common biometrics systems and equipment.<BR>5) Administers the DoDs Biometrics governance structure to enable the development and execution of common requirements, standards, architectures, and research and development initiatives to support common and joint requirements.<BR>6) Manages authoritative DoD repositories of biometrics samples and acts as a hub for biometrics data sharing, to include providing for continuity of operations and disaster recovery in accordance with ASD(NII/CIO).<BR>7) Coordinates all Biometrics program activities with identity protection and stakeholder organizations to ensure consistency with DoD identity management principles, directives, and vision.<BR>8) Conducts Biometrics Science and Technology, research and engineering for DoD, and other US Government sponsors in support of the DoD S&T roadmap.<BR>9) Designs, builds, fields, and sustains Biometrics solutions both in CONUS and OCONUS facilities.<BR>The BOSS-R acquisition will be conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation.  Performance-based contracting (as described in FAR Part 37.6) is the preferred method for acquiring services. <BR>The DoD intends to issue multiple awards, for a performance-based, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract.  The resulting contract has an estimated value of $124 million, and will have a three year base period with two one-year options.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the BOSS-R acquisition is 541611 (Administrative and General Management) under Sector 54 - Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, with a small business size standard of $6,500,000.00.  The offeror will be required to support up to TOP SECRET security clearance.  <BR><BR>3. BOSS-R Scope<BR>The scope of this acquisition has been defined in broad terms to support the expansive mission of the Biometrics requirement, but with sufficient detail to allow vendors to ascertain BTF Biometrics program requirements.  The Contractor shall provide the full range of biometrics services, technical and management expertise, and solution-related enabling products the functional categories to meet the mission needs of the BTF.  The Contractors shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, equipment, facilities, travel, and other services required to satisfy the ordered biometric capabilities and solutions.  While the requirement identifies three functional categories, the suite of resulting contracts is intended to satisfy the full range of biometric related requirements.  With the pace of change it is impossible to anticipate how biometric requirements and individual programs will evolve over the life of the contracts.  It is intended that the BOSS-R contract remains current and continues to provide the full range of biometrics capabilities/solutions and emerging technologies throughout its life.  The Contractor shall provide solutions for one or more of the following functional categories.<BR><BR>Functional Categories<BR>The Contractor shall furnish the full range of solutions and services necessary to meet requirements of the contract as related to the functional categories described below.  All solutions and services must meet BTF, DoD and commercial policies, standards, and procedures.<BR><BR>Functional Category 1  Management Support Services<BR>The Contractor shall provide, as ordered, the full range of business and technical management services needed to support on-going program management and supporting technical activities.

Other testing services will be provided to satisfy specific agency requirements and will be tailored for those purposes. The Contractor will support the analysis for future acquisition needs and provide technology forecasts involving technology development based on the DoDs future deployment strategies. This will involve the creation of technology prototypes for technology demonstration projects. The Contractor will provide the necessary strategy development for the ongoing forward planning for the integration of new technologies, concepts and organizations in support of the DoD biometric deployment strategy, implementation, integration, and software application maintenance.<BR><BR>4. Advisory Multi-Step <BR>The AMS is being conducted to allow potential offerors to submit qualifying documentation demonstrating their corporate qualifications that will allow the Government to advise them about their potential to be viable competitors for a specific acquisition.  The AMS process is accomplished at minimal cost to the vendors and government by asking the vendors to submit limited information that focuses on the vendors Corporate Capability and Experience.  The Government will evaluate all responses in accordance with the published criteria, and advise each offeror in writing whether they will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, they are unlikely to be a viable competitor (including a general basis for that opinion).  Notwithstanding the advice provided by the government, offerors identified as unlikely to be viable competitors may still participate in the resultant acquisition, as long as they recognize the inherent risks of doing so.  <BR><BR>5.

<DESC><p>The 95th Contracting Squadron, Edwards Air Force base CA 93524 is seeking potential sources capable of the demolishing of unneeded and obsolete buildings and it&rsquo;s infrastructure as well as abatement if necessary. Abatement for purposes of this requirement will mean the removal or encapsulation of lead or asbestos-containing materials found after the initial or sampling surveys have identified the area of consideration. The abatement may include but is not limited to removal and disposal of asbestos and/or lead containing material. Performance under any resultant contract must meet all applicable standards and codes. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number for this effort is 238910. It is anticipated that a firm fixed-price contract will be awarded. The period of performance will consist of a five year performance period. Contract award is estimated to take place on or about 8 September 2008. Source Selection procedures can be found in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.3-Source Selection, Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), Air Force FAR Supplement (AFFARS) and the Air Force Materiel Command FAR Supplement (AFMCFARS) thereto. These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FAR Site, http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil and will be used to obtain the best value for the Government for this acquisition. In using the best value approach, the Government will award to an offeror who gives the greatest confidence that they will best satisfy our requirements in an affordable manner. This synopsis constitutes one form of early industry involvement and the Government requests industry recommendations, opinions, and feedback. This sources sought synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to attract, solicit, and ultimately make a single award to an 8(a) contractor in Region IX (California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii, and Guam). Prospective vendor should provide via fax or email answers to the following questions: 1) Your company&rsquo;s bonding level, 2) Your status as an 8(a) contractor and the date of your graduation from the 8(a) program, 3) Your agreement to the Disputes Clause 52.233-1 Alt 1, and 4) Your ability to obtain liability insurance in the amount of not less than $1M per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage liability combined. Must provide proof of business size representation through the Central Contract Registration (CCR) found at http://www.ccr.gov/ and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) found at https://orca.bpn.gov/ The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005) (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timeliness for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Douglas P. Constant, AFFTC/PK, 5 S Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB CA 93524-1185, phone number (661) 277-2006, facsimile number (661) 277-3784. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

Hence award date is anticipated for the 1st Qtr of FY09.<BR><BR>The following FY clarifications are provided for the benefit of those not familiar with the Government fiscal years.<BR><BR>Such fiscal years are typically numbered using a calendar year and quarter thereof. A fiscal quarter is 3 months 1/4 of a year.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Endurance Program seeks interested vendors to support production of a new man mounted survival item/body armor carrier. This carrier will be a replacement for the currently fielded survival vest and body armor worn by USN and USMC operators of H-46, H-53, UH-1, H-60, V-22, and AH-1 aircraft. Competitive production contract(s) to a Navy specification will be awarded in 2010. This notice is to announce an industry day to be held 19 June 2008 so that potential suppliers may be prepared to present webbings, hardware components, harness components, and fabrics that may be incorporated into the manufacturing specification to enhance the capability of the system. The USN intends to present design and integration requirements as well as system design concepts during this Industry Day. Participation in this Industry Day is not mandatory and will not preclude any interested vendors from participation in the subsequent procurement. 

Specific hardware components sought include but are not limited to: webbing closures, pocket attachment hardware, pocket closures, garment closures, rip-cords, and friction adjusters that can be blind-operated with a wetted, gloved, hand; that will operate in the sandy conditions of the Middle East as well as wet rainy conditions; that are durable in extreme heat and cold, that have a matte finish; that have a 66 lb hardware retention strength, are snag resistant; that exhibit salt-fog corrosion resistance, high heat resistance, flame resistance; are  lightweight, low bulk, consistent multiple use, easily replaceable, and that have no parts or components that can accidentally detach or shed under rotor wash, high wind, or light impact.

Specific fabrics and tapes/ webbings sought include but are not limited to those appropriate for load-carrying  (e.g., 7-lb hard armor plate, 10-lb soft armor, 40 pounds of survival items). Such fabrics must be flame and high-heat resistant, and ideally, highly air permeable.  A fabric that can provide a slick yet durable lining for the hard armor plate to allow it to slip in and out of a durable outer pocket is also desired.   

Specific harness components sought include but are not limited to webbings, fasteners, friction adjusters, and closures that comply with ANSI Z359 for fall protection, and are flame resistant, high heat resistant.  Webbing fasteners shall meet not only all requirements of the hardware components above but in addition, be able to be quickly disconnected under tension, e.g., an aviator whose harness is snagged in an underwater emergency. 

Vendors may prepare a list of concerns and questions they may have regarding the requirements for this industry day. No written responses will be provided from the Government. Vendors are encouraged to bring product samples, test results, and evidence of Berry amendment compliance. Vendors are strongly encouraged to avoid the use of presentation software, and to avoid marketing and advertising content. Vendors are requested to provide the name of their company, organization, and/or division group. Vendor participation is limited to no more than 2 people per company. Vendors will have the opportunity to schedule an individual appointment for that day with Mary Marseglia of STV Inc beginning May 27, 2008 (301-862-2344). Each appointment will be no longer than 20 minutes in duration. The purpose of the appointment is to allow vendors to ask and answer questions in a closed forum. All questions and answers will be recorded and released to the general public. 

This is not a notice of formal solicitation. Requirements for delivery schedules, quantities, and qualification of units have not been established. However suggestions that may assist the Navy in preparing their solicitation are welcome. 

In order to request an appointment for participation in this Industry Day, interested parties shall contact Ms. Marseglia by electronic mail at mary.marseglia@stvinc.com only; no phone calls or other forms of contact shall be used.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this &ldquo;sources sought&rdquo; is to identify hotels willing to provide meeting space, lodging, and meals in the Los Angeles, California area, in light of new guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs. Two of the new requirements prescribe limits for meals and refreshments served at breaks. Regarding meals, the new guideline states that the cost of any meal provided, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 150 percent of the locality M&amp;IE per meal. For example, if breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $64.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $12.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $18.00 ($12.00 X 150%) per person. If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $64.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $18.00 per lunch. Therefore, the cost of the lunch provided at the conference cannot exceed $27.00 ($18.00 X 150%) per person. The new guideline defines refreshments as light food and drinks served at breaks and include such items as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins. Under the new guidelines the cost of these items, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 23 percent of the locality (M&amp;IE) for both morning and afternoon breaks. For the Los Angeles, CA area, the M&amp;IE rate is $64.00 per person. Therefore, the cost of the refreshments cannot exceed $14.72 ($64.00 X 23%) per person per day. Any hotel source interested and capable of providing lodging at the Federal per diem rates and meeting the new guideline requirements should submit a statement of capabilities, to include sleeping and meeting capacity, floor charts, and food and beverage menus, to the point of contact identified. The food and beverage menus should support the pricing mentioned above, including hotel service costs: breakfast, $18.00 per person; lunch, $27.00 per person; and refreshments for both morning and afternoon breaks, $14.72 per person.</p>
