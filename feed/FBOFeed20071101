<RESPDATE>111607
<ARCHDATE>12162007
<CONTACT>Joyce Edwards-Williams, (202) 267-9781
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) Follow-on contract to Raytheon Company located in Fullerton, CA on a single-source basis.   In accordance with Section 3.2.2.4 of the FAA Acquisition Management System, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis for the single-source decision.  For a period of six (6) weeks, FAA conducted a sources sought market survey which yielded only one respondent--Raytheon Company. The WAAS Follow-on (WFO) contract will provide life-cycle support including technical refresh of WAAS hardware and require the implementation of software and hardware modifications to increase robustness of WAAS.  The contract will also provide second-level engineering support to increased availability and coverage of WAAS Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV-200) service.  The contract will have a potential three-year period of performance. The primary focus of the WFO contract will be to transition reliance for WAAS support from contractor-based to FAA-led support.  The transition effort will cross many technical areas which will require the buildup of knowledge and training of FAA personnel by the end of the contract duration.  This procurement strategy lays the foundation for a competitive acquisition for continued WAAS services in the FY11 timeframe.    WAAS is a national, mission-critical safety of life navigation system; therefore, maintenance and performance upgrades must be executed such that operational availability, continuity and integrity performance are maintained.  Raytheon Corporation (RC) is uniquely qualified to maintain WAAS integrity performance, manage WAAS safety and design assurance, perform WAAS test and integration, and software development of safety-critical software.  Further, in-depth knowledge of the Full-Lateral Performance (FLP) WAAS is required in order to adequately execute transition of required capabilities from the contractor to the FAA.  RC's corporate knowledge and unique personnel skill set facilitates achieving the FAA's transition goals which will eventually allow the FAA to remove current dependencies and move towards an open, competitive market.   Raytheon has demonstrated capabilities in developing and maintaining the WAAS software development environment and test tool suites; developing WAAS software in accordance with RTCA DO-178B; developing, validating, and fielding software intensive modifications to a complete operational nation-wide complex WAAS.  In addition, Raytheon has demonstrated knowledge and expertise with the WAAS/SBAS/GBAS signal generation algorithms and has applied aviation system safety standards (SAE ARP 4754 or 4761) to product development; executed analyses or assessments in support of product development.  These analyses and assessments include Operational Safety Assessment, Preliminary Hazard Analysis, Functional Hazard Analysis, System/Subsystem Hazard Analysis, System Safety Assessment, Fault Tree Analysis, Failure Modes and Effects Analyses and Common Cause Analysis.  Raytheon has also demonstrated knowledge and experience in providing the mathematical techniques to prove Hazardously Misleading Information (HMI) probabilities and perform HMI analysis for WAAS upgrades to an operational system.   Please direct any questions/comments regarding this matter to the Joyce Edwards-Williams, Contracting Officer, at (202) 267-9781 (VMX) or joyce.edwards-williams@faa.gov.  In order to receive prompt consideration, all questions/comments must be submitted NLT 3PM EDT November 16, 2007.

I.  OVERVIEW 

INTRODUCTION
The Smithsonian Institution (SI) invites and welcomes your participation in an exploration of development opportunities for the Arts and Industries Building (AIB). The AIB is a National Historic Landmark and is located directly adjacent to the Smithsonian Castle on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The building is one of approximately 2400 National Historic Landmarks designated by the Secretary of the Interior as of the highest significance to the American people.  As such, any proposed use of the AIB will be keenly scrutinized by a significant number of interested parties, including the Congress, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the National Park Service, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, the District of Columbia State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and, of course, many interested public and private groups and individuals.

As owner and ultimate overseer of a number of irreplaceable assets on the Mall, as a longtime resident on the Mall, and as an institution that is devoted to furthering knowledge and an understanding of the nation's history, the Smithsonian is keenly focused on the appropriate preservation and re-use of the AIB.  The Smithsonian does not have funding now or in the foreseeable future to rehabilitate the AIB, given funding needs for its other actively-used building assets.  Accordingly, the Smithsonian is interested in considering proposals from private or other public sector users to redevelop and operate the building either under a license agreement or other long term arrangement and thereby return this important building to productive use.

This Request for Qualifications ("RFQ") is the first step in the process that may lead to selection of an AIB Redevelopment Entity ("RE").  If responses to this RFQ are promising, it is the Smithsonian's present intent to follow this RFQ with a second step consisting of a more focused and detailed Request for Proposals ("RFP") that will be circulated only to a selected smaller group of finalist candidates.  However, the Smithsonian expressly reserves the right in its sole discretion not to proceed with an RFP or any subsequent negotiations or agreement, and this request shall not commit the Smithsonian to pay any preparation costs nor to make reimbursement for any of the costs associated with a response to this request.

The National Mall has been the symbolic heart of the United States for more than a century. More than 20 million visitors come to the Mall each year, visiting the Smithsonian museums - the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Hirshhorn Gallery and Sculpture Garden, the National Museum of African Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, and the Freer Gallery of Art - as well as the National Gallery of Art.   The Smithsonian is both the Nation's preeminent conservator and exhibitor of American culture and history and a defining presence on the National Mall.  Use of one of the key Mall buildings by a non-Smithsonian and possibly non-government user has few precedents and must be considered judiciously.  However, redevelopment of the AIB opens the possibility of bringing other exciting and important uses to the Mall and represents a unique opportunity for a visionary team to establish a presence on the Mall and form an association with a cultural institution of national and international importance. 

BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND ASSUMPTIONS

Considering the symbolic and practical magnitude of this decision, the Smithsonian has been very deliberate in its consideration of possible AIB redevelopment and reuse.  The Smithsonian is interested in a RE whose vision for AIB is compatible with the extraordinary importance of the building, its location, and the Smithsonian's mission to promote "the increase and diffusion of knowledge." 

	The Smithsonian will favor redevelopment concepts that will capitalize on AIB's extraordinary location, maximize the opportunity to bring the public into the building, attract visitors to the Mall, and add value to existing Smithsonian museums.

	Concepts for museum, theater or exhibition uses are welcome, assuming the uses do not duplicate the function or focus of other museums on the Mall.

	The Smithsonian will consider redevelopment approaches that include mission-related commercial use, exhibit use, conference use and/or mixed use retail. Importantly, any of these concepts for reuse must be compatible with the ambiance of the Mall and serve visitors to the Mall and Washington, D.C.

	One of the Smithsonian's goals is to preserve and protect traditional American cultural elements. Accordingly, any proposed use that furthers this objective will be of significant interest to Smithsonian.  The Smithsonian welcomes concepts that combine typical private sector redevelopment goals with educational, scientific, cultural, technological, or other like-minded elements. 

	The Smithsonian's preferred means of transferring control of the building is through a license agreement or other long term arrangement with the selected RE.  The Smithsonian will work with the selected team to structure a relationship that is appropriate given the commitments of both parties to the project.

	The Smithsonian will entertain proposals based on either publicly or privately sponsored redevelopment of the building.

	The Smithsonian has certain exclusive service contracts with which the selected RE will need to comply.  None of these contracts is of such form or magnitude that it should detract from the desirability or financial feasibility of the project. The Smithsonian will provide further information on these contracts and obligations as the process progresses. 

	The Smithsonian may choose to retain a portion of the AIB for internal exhibition or other traditional Smithsonian uses. These uses, if any, will be integrated with and be complementary to the redevelopment.  It is not anticipated that these uses, if any, will have a negative effect on the overall redevelopment opportunity.

	The RE will be responsible for all restoration costs and ongoing operating, maintenance and replacement expenses during the term. The applicability of Davis-Bacon wage rates should be assumed.

	The Smithsonian will not entertain concepts for uses that are inappropriate to the dignity of the Mall and to the general public that visit it.  Accordingly, uses such as nightclubs or similar commercial entertainment venues, residences, hotels, religious activities, or partisan political activities will not be considered.

	There is no parking facility available, only street parking.

	Any rehabilitation will be subject to oversight by the Smithsonian.

	It is expected that the RE will meet any necessary compliance reviews required by the District of Columbia and/or various agencies.

	The final redevelopment plan will be subject to approval by the Smithsonian's Board of Regents.
  
II. BUILDING DESCRIPTION

The Arts and Industries Building is the second oldest of the Smithsonian museums on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Initially called the National Museum, it was built to provide the Smithsonian with its first proper facility for public display of its growing collections. The building, designed by architects Adolf Cluss and Paul Schulze, opened in 1881 in time to host an inaugural ball for President James A. Garfield.  The approximate size of the building is 180,000 gross square feet. The building was designed as a symmetrical Greek cross in plan with a central rotunda. The exterior was constructed with geometric patterns of polychrome brick, and a sculpture entitled Columbia Protecting Science and Industry by sculptor Caspar Buberl was placed above the main entrance on the north side.  The interior of the building was partially lit through the use of skylights and clerestory windows. 
 
In 1910 the natural history collections were moved to the new National Museum of Natural History, and the old museum was given its present name in 1916. In 1964 the remaining exhibitions were moved to the National Museum of History and Technology, now known as the National Museum of American History. In 1976, the Arts and Industries Building reopened with 1876: A Centennial Exhibition, featuring objects from across the globe that had been displayed at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The building later housed temporary exhibitions and a children's theater, known as the Discovery Theater.  In 2004 the museum was closed to the public.  Until vacated in late 2006, certain Smithsonian departments occupied portions of the building for general office use.  

III. GENERAL STIPULATIONS

The Smithsonian has expended considerable effort exploring the redevelopment feasibility of the AIB and reviewing historical materials related to the physical structure. Accordingly, several important issues regarding the building must be considered in any redevelopment effort:

1.	As previously stated, the RE will be financially responsible for the building restoration, operations, and long term maintenance. The Smithsonian has examined numerous scenarios for redevelopment and applied preliminary costing to these scenarios.  Based on these costing efforts, the Smithsonian believes there are many future redevelopment scenarios (including those described in this offering) that are acceptable and appropriate for the building and that are financially viable. 

2.	Any reuse of the building must respect the basic interior elements of the AIB, including the major historic interior spaces (Rotunda, Halls, Ranges and Courts).  Any required rehabilitation of the exterior of the facility will have to meet historic preservation standards outlined in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Interior character-defining elements must be sensitively treated.  In general that means that some modern materials can be substituted for original materials, but the appearance of the exterior cannot be materially changed.
  
3.	Any exterior signage will be subject to approval. The name etched on the outside of the building - National Museum - and the current name of the building "Arts and Industries" must be maintained. The building cannot be renamed for an individual, family, group, firm or corporation, although naming opportunities for interior spaces may be possible.

4.	The Smithsonian has conducted extensive reviews of the work necessary to make the building structurally and environmentally sound and to provide a "conditioned shell" ready for interior fitout. Cost estimates have assumed that the interior spaces will be reconfigured to their layout circa 1900, which anticipates removal of more recent partitioning and inserted floors.  The current estimates contemplate upgrading/replacing the previously replaced windows, providing appropriate security and fire protection, installing modern links to the on-site US General Services Administration heating and cooling district, but do not include the cost of distribution within the building. The estimate includes a complete replacement of the roof, including repair, reinforcement or replacement of the existing iron roof trusses.  Also included are simple wall finishes and associated soft costs.  The detailed cost estimates for this "conditioned shell" range from approximately $55 to $65 million.

Step Two of the process following the RFQ may be a more specific Request for Proposal (RFP) phase.  Only those potential REs who have responded to this RFQ and have submitted the best responses to the selection criteria will be invited to participate in the RFP process.  


IV. REQUIREMENTS 

This RFQ requests that the potential RE teams provide three distinct classes of information:  Qualifications, Vision, and Transaction Structure.  Responses should be detailed and comprehensive.

A.  QUALIFICATIONS
The primary goal of this process is to select an experienced and highly qualified RE that has the ability to finance and deliver a first class and appropriate redevelopment concept practically and expeditiously.  We are seeking in the RFQ stage basic background information about the RE team and its track record of performance. 

As part of the response, please provide us with specific information regarding the following:

For a Development Entity

	Please provide a general overview of your organization and partners that will be responsible for delivering the redevelopment of the building. Describe the roles of all key members related to the redevelopment and operation of the project.  Answer the following questions:  Who will lead the team?  Has the team worked together before and, if so, on what projects?  Does the team have historic redevelopment skills or experience?  Are any of the team members experienced in the Washington, DC, development market?  Please describe your experience with publicly funded entities and provide as many examples as possible of successful projects led by your organization.

For a Governmental, Non-Governmental, or other Non-Development Entity

	Please provide as much detail as possible about your organization. Answer the following question:  Where are you currently located, and what groups within your organization are you proposing to occupy AIB? 



For all Responses

	Provide your experience with license agreement development projects or similar structures. Answer the following questions:  What has the degree of success been (please be as specific as possible) in these relationships?  What have been the benefits and challenges of these structures for your projects?

	If you are selected as the RE to redevelop AIB, what do you anticipate the schedule to be for redevelopment completion and AIB occupancy? How will your group work with SI to make the redevelopment occur as smoothly as possible?

	Describe your organization's experience in 1) historic restoration, 2) managing and operating a large public facility, 3) providing a regularly scheduled maintenance and long-term system replacement strategy, and 4) providing security.

	Provide an overview of your organization's financial strength that will be relied upon for completion of this project.  We are very interested in the financial structure (preliminary, if necessary) that you would use, the structures you typically use and the entities/investors/financiers you typically work with on these developments, and the timing for including these entities.  Do you have the funds on hand to make this redevelopment happen or will a fundraising effort be required?   Discuss your previous fundraising campaigns and how your organization will generate funds for this endeavor.  Has your Board or top management already approved in concept a relocation or move of certain elements of your organization to the AIB?

B.  VISION FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT
The AIB occupies an extremely prominent position in the heart of the National Mall.  The Smithsonian, as the long term steward of the building, will carefully review and approve the final development plan for the building.  Please provide us with your preliminary vision and concept for the redevelopment.  Detail the challenges you see with the redevelopment. We are not seeking detailed renderings or architectural plans at this juncture.  Instead, we are seeking basic representations and descriptions of how your team would approach the opportunity and bring the vision to fruition.  Please explain why the proposed concept would be appropriate on the National Mall and how it would complement the Smithsonian's other museum offerings.

C.  TRANSACTION STRUCTURE 
SI has preliminarily identified a license agreement or other long term arrangement as the most appropriate type of relationship between the selected RE and SI.  However, please give us your perspective on how the redevelopment plan can best be structured.  Describe any additional transaction related (or control, or decision making) issues that are critical for you and your concept to be successful.  



V. RFQ SELECTION CRITERIA 
We anticipate that potential RE's will present outstanding qualifications, redevelopment vision, and transaction structure.  The RFQ proposals will be carefully evaluated against the following factors:

	Proposing creative, appropriate, and exciting reuse concepts that complement Smithsonian activity on the Mall and provide educational, cultural or other services to the Mall visitors; 
 
	Demonstrating past and current managerial capability that can carry this project to fruition;

	Preserving this historic asset while making the building into a productive asset for Smithsonian and the public; and 

	Demonstrating a well defined track record of successful operations, financial stability and the financial capability to proceed with full redevelopment within 24 months of execution of an agreement with the Smithsonian.

Characteristics: The CPPs for the DREAM are as follows:  X	Shall provide three (3) kilowatt (kW) (CPP) to 5 kW (OBJECTIVE) output electric power at any time during a given 12 hour period (CPP) to 48 hour period (OBJECTIVE);  X	The Light Tactical Trailer, Heavy Chassis (LTT-HC), NSN 2330-01-387-5424 shall be the trailer upon which the DREAM is mounted (CPP).   X	Shall be capable of sustained operation at up to 95¢XF at 4000 feet above sea level (CPP). Contract Structure:  The Government anticipates issuing multiple initial contracts to successful offerors. This program utilizes a refining system concept structure, of three program phases, as follows: The Base Contract will be for Phase 1 efforts.  Up to three contractors may be selected for award. This phase has a 3-month duration. Analytical efforts will constitute Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001.  CLIN 0001 will be a Time and Material CLIN with a Not-To-Exceed (NTE) cost for this phase of $75,000 per contractor.  Data items as detailed in the SOO will constitute CLIN 0002. CLIN 0002 will be Not Separately Priced (NSP). Based on the results of Phase 1, the Government may exercise up to two options for the performance of Phase 2.  Only contractors from Phase 1 will be considered for Phase 2.  Phase 2 has an 8 month duration and is for detailed design, hardware fabrication, and contractor check-out testing.  CLIN 0002 will be a Time and Material CLIN with a Not-To-Exceed (NTE) cost for this phase of $400,000 per contractor. Analytical and hardware efforts will constitute CLIN 0003.  Data items as detailed in the SOO will constitute CLIN 0004. CLIN 0004 will be Not Separately Priced (NSP). Based on the results of Phase 2, the Government may exercise up to two options for the performance of Phase 3.  Only contractors from Phase 2 will be considered for Phase 3.  This phase has a 5-month duration and is for support to Government testing and system maturation.  CLIN 0005 will be a Time and Material CLIN with a Not-To-Exceed (NTE) cost for this phase of $250,000 per contractor. Analytical and hardware efforts will constitute CLIN 0005.  Data items as detailed in the SOO will constitute CLIN 0006. CLIN 0006 will be Not Separately Priced (NSP). Alternative schedules may be proposed if they offer clear benefit to the Government for decreased cost or more rapid development in support of demonstration. Follow-on contractual efforts for additional systems to support operational uses or subsequent testing are envisioned to be procured under a sole-source arrangement to a final selected contractor from Phase 3 contractors that delivered and supported previous and representative hardware systems. Verification: Unless otherwise specified, the offeror is responsible for the execution of all inspections and certifications related to conformance and performance of the DREAM and all components.      Packaging: Best commercial practices.      Commercial Warranty: Warranty provisions or exclusions shall be clearly stated in the offerors' proposal submission.      Delivered units from Phase 2 will be shipped F.O.B. destination 29 Palms, California.  Federal Acquisition Regulation-52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, (Jan 2004): Multiple Offers are discouraged.  Offerors shall submit a combined technical/business proposal. One original and four (4) written copies shall be submitted.  Proposals shall be prepared using "Arial" or "Times New Roman" 12 point font style on 8 1/2 x 11 inch white paper.  Tables and illustrations may use a reduced font style, not less than 8 points. Foldouts are not allowed. All material submitted may be single-spaced. Offerors should ensure that each page provides identification of the submitting Offeror in the header or footer. Page count for the combined technical/business proposal shall not exceed 35 total pages exclusive of cover page, back page, and letter of transmittal. Supporting documentation with a page count limited to 50 pages may be submitted as a separate enclosure, to address corporate capability or past performance. Only 1 copy of supporting literature should be provided.  Sealed!   offers for the items to be provided shall be hand-carried or express mailed via UPS or Federal Express to the following location by 2:00PM (EST) 04 January 2007: COMMANDER, Attn: Shekela Hutchinson, CTQ, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street, VA, 22134-5010. NOTE: Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address.

(ii) Capabilities / Facilities (to include Engineering Analysis Capability, Manufacturing and Assembly Capability, and Sub-contractor and Team Arrangement management) - Less important. (iii) Past Performance - Least important.   Price - Evaluated, but not rated. Award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal presents the best value to the Government. In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall technical, capabilities/facilities, and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price. However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror(s) within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations. FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation w!  ill contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company¡¦s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather inf!  ormation you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the offici al version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam!   Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B. Destination.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS: Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form. Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.     Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided. Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.

<DESC>Architect-Engineer or Engineering Services are required primarily for Virginia, North Carolina, and West Virginia, but shall include other various activities within the Geographic area of responsibility of Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic, including the Continental United States, the Caribbean, Africa and Europe.  The primary purpose is to conduct subsurface investigations with subsequent geotechnical/foundation analysis - including monitoring, sampling and analysis of soil and groundwater for geotechnical properties and environmental contamination using various field and laboratory tests.  The contractor must be capable of providing design services when required.  The design will typically be for foundation of structures or airfield pavement but may consist of any design discipline or system this Command provides.  Also included is the testing and evaluation of subsurface, construction and building materials for contract compliance.  Construction or Materials testing laboratories performing work under this contract must be accredited by one of the laboratory accreditation authorities.  The laboratorys accreditation shall include the ASTM standards as appropriate to the tests listed in this contract.  This policy applies to the specific laboratory performing the actual testing, not just the Corporate Office.  Submit to Code CIGE a copy of the Certificate of Accreditation and Scope of Accreditation.  The scope of the laboratorys accreditation shall include the test methods employed within the Contract.  For testing laboratories that have not yet obtained certification by an acceptable Laboratory Accreditation Authority listed below, submit an acknowledgement letter within 30 days after award of this contract from one of the Laboratory Accreditation Authorities indicating that the application for accreditation has been received and the accreditation process has started.

Laboratory Accreditation Authorities

	National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP)
Administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
	The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Program
	ICBO Evaluation Service, Inc. (ICBO ES)
	The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) Program
	The Army Corps of Engineers
	Washington Area Council of Engineering Laboratories (WACEL) 
Approval authority by WACEL is limited to projects within the FEC Ches  geographical area 


Field investigation typically will require mobilization to locations using transportation not provided by the U. S. Government, arranging for required security clearance to obtain base access for all drillers and equipment, field location of utilities with appropriate equipment, and locating and performing borings.  Provide GPS (Lat/Long) coordinates for boring locations and landmarks  accurate to 3 meters or better.  Mobilization charge includes personnel for boring layout, charges for scoping for utilities and coordination with the local point(s) of contact  including necessary clearances and permission for access.  Provide 24-hour groundwater data in a minimum of three representative locations.  If the drilling method does not allow direct reading from the borehole, a temporary well must be installed.
2.	Incidental monitoring requiring sampling and analysis of soil and groundwater for environmental contamination shall include, but not be limited to, providing capability to monitor boreholes for combustible gas or petroleum vapors at sites of potentially contaminated soil material and/or groundwater, and providing labor, equipment and protection measures (EPA Levels C and D) for performing subsurface investigations.  Services shall also include providing soils and environmental personnel (technical and professional) at field and laboratory locations to perform or evaluate subsurface investigation, testing or inspection for subsequent construction design.  A typical report will include a description of the drilling method used and any pertinent site observations along with the boring location plan, the boring logs and tabulated laboratory test results with typical graphical backup.  Services may include a more extensive written report containing a discussion of sampling procedures and site conditions influencing investigation/testing/project design, project recommendations based upon interpretation of test results and the results of investigation/testing performed.  One electronic and 1 hard copy of each report will be provided.  The electronic copy shall be provided on CD in an AUTOCAD compatible format (either .DFX or .DWG).  Provide a book marked Adobe acrobat file of the geotechnical report on CD. The text of the report shall be in text-selectable format, i.e. not in scanned raster format.  Also provide one hard copy of the report.  Boring logs and notes, a summary of lab test results, and groundwater observations shall be prepared on a NAVFACLANT D-size sheet in accordance with current LANT AutoCAD standards.  Code CIGE will provide a current D-size sheet drawform template.  Forwarding of the boring log sheet to the Government indicates that the drafted logs have been checked by a Professional Engineer of the drilling firm for completeness, accuracy and conformity to LANT drafting standards.  The completed D-size .dwg file shall be forwarded to LANT Code CIGE by e-mail as soon as it is available with the CD and hard copies mailed soon thereafter.
3.	The A&E must demonstrate his and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all services.  Evaluation factors (1) through (5) are of equal importance; factor (6) is of lesser importance and will be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms.  Specific evaluation factors include:  (1) Specialized Experience - Firms will be evaluated in terms of:  (a) their past experience with regard to geotechnical and environmental investigations, testing and analysis; and (b) knowledge of local codes, laws, permits and construction materials and practices in the contract area (greater weight will be given to the States of Virginia, North Carolina and West Virginia); (2) Professional qualifications and technical competence in the type of work required:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of the design staff's:  (a) active professional registration; (b) experience (with present and other firms) and specific roles of staff members  on projects addressed in evaluation factor number one; (c) capability to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of services and surge ability to meet unexpected project demands; and (d) organization and office management as evidenced by management approach (management plan for this contract) and personnel roles in organization.

<DESC>This Presolicitation Notice is published in order to identify interested parties capable of providing a set of preliminary assessments of the types of instruments and the technical feasibility of measuring from the NPOESS earth-orbiting platforms absolute, high accuracy, high spectral resolution, thermal infrared radiances emitted from the earth?s atmosphere into space. The assessments need to include the consideration of measurements of the effects of atmospheric greenhouse gases, aerosols and the atmospheric thermodynamic conditions and their variability. The results of these assessments are to be incorporated into the studies to assess the fulfillment of NOAA requirements to measure with global or near-global coverage the infrared forcing of the earth?s climate conditions and trends.  

The NPOESS is a satellite system used to monitor global environmental conditions, and collect and disseminate data related to: weather, atmosphere, oceans, land and near-space environment.  The NOPESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) organizationally resides within the Department of Commerce, NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS).  The Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), created the IPO to develop, acquire, manage, and operate the NOPESS satellites.  The NOPESS requirements were developed by the user community and are captured in the NPOESS Integrated Operational Requirements (IORD).  To achieve its mission, the IPO has undertaken a far-reaching program of sensor development, and satellite transition and evolution to provide complete coverage of environmental conditions for civil, military, and scientific purposes.  The IPO?s operational effectiveness depends on its ability to keep pace with rapidly developing technologies.  To accomplish this, the IPO researches and develops initiatives through its Internal Government Studies (IGS) program.  The IGS program consists of teams of scientists and engineers from Government laboratories and centers, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, universities, and industry.  These teams are tasked to identify and test requirements and objectives.  

The results of the above studies will provide:
1. A strategic assessment of the types of spaceborne instruments necessary to achieve SI [International System of Units] traceable accuracy, on-orbit for spectrally resolved infrared radiance measurements from Space.
2. An assessment and analysis of laboratory investigations directed toward the physics of high accuracy metrology that forms the foundation for spectrally resolved infrared radiance measurements from Space.
3. An assessment of orbit requirements for the recovery of high accuracy climate statistics for spectrally resolved infrared radiance measurements from Space.
4. An assessment of current systems such as Aqua, the NNP, and the NPOESS instrument combinations with respect to the technical capability of those instruments to achieve a given level of accuracy, on-orbit.
5. An assessment of subsystem design criteria required to achieve 0.1 K accuracy in absolute spectrally resolved radiance in the thermal infrared.
6. An analysis of alternate, independent techniques such as GPS sounding that would provide fully independent analysis of the accuracy of absolute spectrally resolved radiance.

All interested, capable, and responsible sources that wish to respond to this Presolicitation Notice  are encouraged to submit documentation of their specific capabilities to perform the identified services; information on similar efforts to include contracts, dollar value, performance period, point of contact information , and description of the requirement; a staffing chart to demonstrate your understanding of the proposed requirement, and the qualifications of staff participants; technical or pricing information; and other market information.  Capability statements should not exceed 20 pages and must also include the following information: The name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, business size and status.  Responses to this notice are due by 12:00 pm EST on November 16, 2007 via email to Kenneth Bell at Kenneth.Bell@noaa.gov.  Responses to this notice will be handled as business/technical proprietary data.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the acquisition of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Electrical Power System (EPS) functionally equivalent breadboard hardware power components.  Breadboard is defined as a non-flight (generally temporary) prototype of an electronic circuit intended exclusively for laboratory testing and experimentation with circuit designs.  This breadboard hardware will allow the Engineering Directorate's Energy Systems Division (ESD) personnel to perform independent and early system level and integration test activities on the design and performance of the CEV EPS, prior to the actual build up and delivery of the CEV Program engineering development units of the power components. It is expected that the NASA Engineering Power Team will gain technical expertise about the CEV Design, how it operates, how it behaves as a system, and what the potential problems are with the current design so that engineering authority can make an independent assessment of whether the current design configuration is the best technical solution. In addition, the objective of this effort is to identify potential problems that may require program action. It will build independent technical confidence that the CEV Power System will work.  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Hamilton Sundstrand.  Because Hamilton Sundstrand is currently designing the CEV EPS hardware, they possess familiarity with technical details needed to design the hardware. The benefits that the required functionally equivalent breadboard hardware can provide to the CEV EPS team will depend significantly on how well this breadboard hardware can duplicate the performance of the flight hardware. The closer the design of the Breadboard hardware is to the design of the actual flight hardware, the more relevant the early system levels test data that the breadboard hardware can provide, and the higher the degree of risk mitigation. Of particular importance, is the capability of the breadboard hardware to characterize technical areas such as the system battery charging approach, protection and fault coordination with current limiting switchgear, power quality, and solar array switching module control schemes. NASA will provide heritage switches that were designed by Hamilton Sundstrand for the International Space Station Program to develop the breadboard hardware. Because these switches were designed, built, and flight qualified by Hamilton Sundstrand they provide a high fidelity representation of the current limiting switches that are baselined in the present design for the flight CEV EPS.  The application of these switches to the breadboard hardware will require intimate technical knowledge of the design and operation of these switches, as well as, knowledge of their control, data acquisition, and thermal requirements. Hamilton Sundstrand possesses the technical knowledge of the CEV spacecraft electrical power system design and operation, the proficiency and experience with the heritage high fidelity components, as well as, the relevant previous experience in the development of breadboard hardware with the same high fidelity components. In addition, HS has the proprietary switch design technology that will be used in the flight hardware electrical system.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities to supply the hardware in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on December 3, 2007. Such capabilities will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>**** FOR TECHNICAL INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT JANET APPLETON ONLY, HER CONTACT INFORMATION IS WITHIN THE BODY OF THIS SOLICITATION**** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the fiber placement of tow-steered composite shells. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from Alliant Techsystems (ATK) Thiokol Launch Systems Group. ATK SEHOs performance in the automated composites manufacturing duties in support of the Fiber Placement of Tow-Steered Composite Shells effort will be further enhanced by the fact that they are located on-site at MSFC and therefore the researcher will have open and free access to their shop, providing a great benefit in facilitation of communication should any questions arise in the performance of this work. In addition, no travel expenses or per diem will be charged for the proposed effort. Since ATK SEHO is co-located at the center, much time and effort will be saved due to the fact that the automated composite manufacturing and fiber placement operations will require technical direction by the MSFC technical POC as the tow-steered composite shells are fabricated in the composite materials research cell in the National Center for Advanced Manufacturing (NCAM). The proximity of the SEHO personnel and manufacturing facilities will greatly facilitate this effort. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact, Janet Appleton at janet.l.appleton@nasa.gov, or fax to 256-544-4401, no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 11/07/2007.

<DESC>****SEND ALL INFORMATION INCLUDING QUOTES AND TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IN WRITING TO TIM CARSON AT TIM.CARSON@NASA.GOV, OR FAX TO 256-544-4401**** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Photomultiplier Tubes, 3 EA. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Hamamatsu Corporation, because of the following: 1.    The requested phototubes are required to replace identical units that were severely damaged during the last flight of the HERO payload. The HERO payload has recently (Sep 07) been fully funded for a Southern Hemisphere flight in 2008, so that repairs must be carried out quickly.  Changing this phototube to another design would necessitate a complete re-design of the whole instrument which would entail considerable cost and time delays that could not be supported by the program schedule and budget. 2.  Hamamatsu is the only company that fabricates such photomultiplier tubes, which are a custom variation of a standard Hamamatsu product. Only Hamamatsu has the necessary hardware and expertise to fabricate such a unit.        3.  The phototubes are necessary to repair the HERO balloon gondola flight.  Funding for this has only recently been approved (September 2007), yet the gondola and support equipment must be shipped to Australia fully rebuilt and tested in May of 2008.  The requested phototubes form the heart of the instrument and rebuilding and fully calibrating these will take approximately 3 months.  As the delivery time quoted is 4 months ARO, these items must be ordered immediately to meet the tight flight schedule.  The HERO balloon gondola is scheduled to fly in Australia in September, 2008. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 9, 2007.

Offerors are notified that this combined synopsis/solicitation has been posted on FedBizOps in four separate parts as follows:  Part A - Synopsis/Solicitation and Parts 1 through 4 which is a list of subscriptions required by the NRC. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 02-07. All referenced Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses may be obtained via the Internet at URL: http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  All referenced NRC Acquisition clauses (NRCAR) may be obtained at http://www.nrc.gov/ADM/CONTRACT/contract.html.   FAR clauses will be indicated by "FAR" followed by the section number.  NRCAR clauses will be indicated by "NRCAR" followed by the section number.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  Solicitation No. RS-CIO-03-320 herein is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).   This RFP is for full and competition and the NAICS Code is 56199.  The NRC intends to issue a Commercial Item, Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Delivery Order Contract, with a period of performance of one year with four additional one year option periods.  The minimum ordering requirement under this effort is $47,500.  The maximum ordering requirement under this effort is $190,000.   The services required by the NRC under this effort are for a SUBSCRIPTION AGENT who is capable of providing the necessary facility, qualified personnel, and computer equipment required to provide serial subscription services for the NRC's Library.  The subscriptions to be renewed for the NRC by the subscription agent can be at Attachment 1.

BACKGROUND -- The NRC Technical Library currently subscribes to approximately 344 serial titles, both domestic and foreign.  Most are scientific in nature, but general magazines and legal journals are required.  Subscriptions to these serials are necessary to provide current information on subjects of interest to NRC staff in performing its duties.  Because of the large number of titles involved, the services of a subscription agent are required. 

BASIC RENEWAL SUBSCRIPTION ORDERING REQUIREMENTS -- It is MANDATORY that the contractor provide NRC with ALL titles on its Subscription Order List  and it is MANDATORY that the subscriptions are offered to the Government at a price that is either discounted or does not exceed the current publisher's price.  It is further MANDATORY that the contractor provide to the Government free or discounted access to the electronic journals, if available from the publisher, for renewal subscription orders.  It is also MANDATORY that the contractor have sufficient capital funding on hand to prepay subscriptions as necessary before the NRC makes it initial major payment to the contractor.  

The contractor shall place the renewal subscription orders by November 1 of each calendar year to prevent subscriptions from lapsing and to avoid gaps in the NRC's Library holdings.  

NEW SUBSCRIPTION ORDERS -- The NRC may require the contractor to place new orders.  All new orders, domestic or foreign, shall be filled promptly upon issuance of a modification to the contract by the Contracting Officer.  In the case of domestic titles, the order request shall be placed within ten (10) calendar days of receipt by the contractor.  In the case of foreign titles, the order request shall be placed within (20)  twenty calendar days of receipt by the contractor.  A written report on the status of all new orders shall be furnished to the NRC's Project Officer on a monthly basis.  On occasion, the NRC may require that an order request be placed on a rush basis.  In such cases, the NRC Project Officer or designee will notify the contractor by telephone or facsimile and request the contractor to advise the publisher of the order request and place the order within twenty-four hours.  The contractor shall inform the NRC Project Officer of the cost and estimated date of receipt of the first issue within five (5) days of the request from the Project Officer.  The Contracting Officer will issue a contract modification for any additional subscriptions required under this effort. The contractor shall provide to the Government , if available from the publisher, free access to the electronic journals, for new subscription orders.  
BILL-TO AND SHIP-TO ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS -- The contractor shall order subscriptions in multiple copies and ship them to multiple addresses (Attachment 2), while maintaining one overall bill-to account.  At the present time the NRC has nine (9) ship-to addresses, including its Regional Offices, each receiving a separate list of serial titles.  One of these ship-to address lists contains the names and mail-stops of NRC Headquarters staff in Rockville, Maryland, to whom serial issues shall be sent direct from the publisher.  The contractor shall ensure that the publishers receive the names and mail-stops of these Headquarters staff members and that the publishers are properly instructed to send issues to the Headquarters staff members attention at the common ship-to address.  The contractor shall not treat each named staff member as a separate ship-to address.   CHANGE OF ADDRESS  -- Change of address, either ship-to address or headquarters staff mail-stop, shall be relayed to the publisher by the contractor within five (5) calendar days of receipt of notification from the Project Officer, at no additional cost to the Government.  The contractor shall provide to the Project Officer a written summary of address changes on a monthly basis, showing date of request and date of notification to publisher.  CLAIMS AND CREDITS -- The contractor shall initiate action on claims for issues not received by NRC personnel within five (5) calendar days of notification by the NRC Project Officer or designee.  All claims shall be resolved either in the form of submission of a duplicate copy of the subscription or a credit to the NRC's account.  The contractor's action on claims shall be completed within twenty (20) calendar days of the Project Officer's notification of the missing issue. The NRC will make an oral claim or utilize a standard form provided by the contractor upon mutual agreement of both parties.  A written report on the status of the claims shall be provided to the Project Officer or designee on a monthly basis.  The contractor shall not charge an additional service fee for claiming missing issues.  When a publisher credits the contractor for any of the NRC's orders, the contractor shall immediately credit the NRC's account in the full amount and shall inform the Project Officer or designee with a credit memorandum with a copy to the Contracting Officer.  When the NRC cancels a subscription, the contractor shall immediately credit the NRC's account with any refund furnished and shall inform the Project Officer or designee via a credit memorandum.  LIST OF TITLES --  The contractor shall generate lists of titles by computer, placing them in alphabetical order and showing number of copies, frequency, subscription period, and price.  Separate lists are necessary for each ship-to address, and also a master list of all titles in one alphabet.  In the case of bill-later items, an accurate estimated price shall be provided.  The NRC may request a separate list of bill-later titles from time to time.  All lists shall be in black type on standard 8-1/2" X 11" white paper for ease of reproduction.  Titles shall be in a consistent, generally accepted form based on current serial cataloging practices.  The lists shall be left-justified by title, with all related information, including Headquarters staff ship-to address, under a given title and indented to the right.  FACILITIES, PERSONNEL, CATALOGUES -- The contractor shall provide the facility, qualified personnel, and computer equipment necessary to generate the required serial title lists and monthly reports which shall be accurate, timely, and properly formatted.  The contractor's annual published catalog shall serve as the basis for titles available from the contractor, but the contractor is expected to provide new or obscure titles required upon request by the NRC as a result of any bibliographic research.  There shall be few, if any, new titles which the NRC orders that the contractor cannot ultimately provide.  However, the contractor shall provide all of the mandatory serial titles reflected on the NRC's Renewal Lists.  The contractor shall send its annual catalog to the NRC Project Officer no later than March 1 of each year of the contract.  The contractor shall regularly inform the NRC Project Officer of title changes and titles that have ceased publication, as this information becomes available.   
SUBSCRIPTION RENEWALS -- The contractor shall submit to the Project Officer the Annual Renewal Lists for the next calendar year no later than August 1 of each contract year.  Separate lists for each ship-to address shall be provided in four copies, containing prices of current publishers' list prices.  This will allow the NRC to make any necessary additions, deletions, or corrections.  The contractor shall administer all subscriptions placed under this contract for the NRC until the expiration of the subscriptions, although the contract may have  expired.  PLACE OF DELIVERY -- The subscriptions to be delivered hereunder shall be delivered, with all charges paid by the contractor, to the addresses listed on the "Ship To" List (Attachment  2).

The Commission will rely upon all such representations made by the offeror both in the evaluation process and for the performance of the work by the offeror selected for award.  NRC intends to evaluate offers and award without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest or accept other than the lowest offer.  An offeror must certify, using the certification reflected at Attachment 3, that its organization meets the mandatory requirements of this Statement of Work.  Offerors that fail to submit the certification (Attachment 3) with its offer, will not be further evaluated for award.  Instructions -- Offerors shall provide past performance information that includes recent and relevant information for a minimum of two contracts performed over the past five (5) years for efforts accomplished in similar size and scope to the NRC's effort.  This information shall include contract number, dollar value, point of contact with a current telephone number and a brief synopsis of the services performed.  The NRC may contact these firms, as well as other firms/sources, at its discretion.  In addition, offerors shall identify all contracts similar in size and scope to this effort that have been terminated for default or convenience or subject to any disputes.  Offerors with no record of relevant past performance history will be evaluated neither favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  PROPOSAL REQUIREMENT - PRICING -- This is a one (1) year contract that includes four additional one (1) year option periods.  The offeror shall submit an overall cost proposal for the entire period of performance (base period and option periods).  All offerors shall submit on separate line items: 1) an estimated price of proposal renewal orders and its handling charge which shall include all costs for providing the services for the base year, 2) an estimated price of proposed renewal orders and its handling charge which shall include all costs for providing the services for each option year, and 3) a total estimated price for the base and option years. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS -- TECHNICAL & MANAGEMENT -- The proposal shall not contain any reference to prices.  The offerors shall submit full and complete information in the order set forth below to permit the NRC to perform a thorough evaluation and make a sound determination of whether the offeror will have a reasonable likelihood of meting the requirements and objectives of this procurement.  The proposal shall be fully self-contained, and shall specifically address the technical evaluation factors.  NRC will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Price is considered a substantial factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness but it is less important than Corporate Experience/Past Performance.  The price factor will not be point scored as the rated criteria. EVALUATION CRITERIA -- The following factors will be used to evaluate offerors: (1) CORPORATE EXPERIENCE/PAST PERFORMANCE (50 POINTS) and TECHNICAL APPROACH (50 POINTS):Criteria 1:	CORPORATE EXPERIENCE/PAST PERFORMANCE (50 POINTS) The offeror shall discuss how well its proposal demonstrates corporate experience and successful past performance on contracts performed within the past five (5) years, similar in size and scope to the effort described in this combined synopsis/solicitation, in providing serial subscription services for both domestic and foreign publications in electronic and paper journal format. Criteria 2:	TECHNICAL APPROACH (50 POINTS) The offeror shall also discuss its ability to provide the necessary resources (i.e., facilities, qualified personnel, and computer equipment) required to perform the services reflected in this combined synopsis/solicitation, to include its ability to provide the NRC with both electronic and paper journals, to include free or discounted access to the electronic journals, if available from the publisher, its ability to meet the established time frame of ten (10) calendar days for processing all new orders for domestic titles and twenty (20) calendar days for processing new order requests for foreign titles.  In addition, the offeror shall discuss its approach to processing rush requests for orders within twenty-four (24) hours; its approach to handling claims for missing issues within five (5) calendar days and having those claims for missing issues resolved within twenty (20) days; and expediting change of address requests within five (5) calendar days of receipt of request from NRC.  
Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  Notice to large businesses:  The subcontracting plan requirements of P.L. 95-507 are applicable to this effort.  Thus, all large businesses determined to be in the competitive range must be prepared to submit a detailed subcontracting plan.  Businesses, large and small, interested in teaming arrangements, should send their business information (i.e., Name, address, contact name and phone number, and size of business) to the NRC Contract Specialist listed at the end of this notice no later than June 19, 2002.  The NRC will post this information in a Teaming Opportunities list by issuance of an amendment to this solicitation.  All parties are put on notice that this limited source list is not representative of all sources which may have accessed this synopsis/solicitation.  A potential offeror may identify suitable multi agency contracts it holds with another Federal agency which may be used to procure the requested goods or services.  The NRC intends to explore the feasibility of using any such multi agency contract to meet the NRC's requirement and reserves the right to cancel the procurement before the solicitation is issued should the NRC locate an appropriate multi agency contract.  All parties will be notified of the awardee's name and address when the award information is synopsized in FedBizOpps.  No telephone inquires concerning this requirement will be accepted.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Aerojet Ordnance Tennessee, 1367 Old State Rte 34, Jonesborough, TN 37659.  AFRL/MNMW desires to purchase one (1) Tungsten Alloy Bar for material property evaluations and testing.  In order for the overall material testing program to have validity and continuity, it is critical to use the same material as was used in previous tests.  This is further mandated as the current materials have been mechanically strengthened and heat treated to the same conditions as previously tested materials.  In order to change vendors, it would require that previous penetration tests be reaccomplished and additional quantities of materials be purchased.  The current alloy, mechanical processing and heat treatment have the optimum balance of strength, toughness and ductility.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.     Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC).  Submit SOCs within 15 days of publication to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn: MiMi Martin, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810.     Please refer technical questions to Morris Dilmore at (850) 882-9644 and contractual questions to MiMi Martin at (850) 883-2675.     An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors.     The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.     When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.     The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.     Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting points of contact identified above.     The Ombudsman is Sue Hunter; her phone number is (937) 904-9700.  Numbered Note 26 applies.

The contractor will review the IT functionality of each specific contract to determine if the fielded system capabilities match the prescribed full operational capacity (FOC) as contracted for in the initial contract instrument.   BACKGROUND The RMS system is a logistical system used to initiate, review and approve repair, general maintenance and spare parts requests.  This system allows for budgetary approval at various levels (and in various locations), determination of actual expenses and forecasting. It is estimated that MARAD has over 900 user IDs for this system.  However, approximately half (1/2) are active users.  The system is installed on 44 ships, at three MARAD operating areas offices, at eight Ship Manager locations, at two contractor sites and at MARAD headquarters office.  The IT infrastructure is owned by the Government but managed by Stanley Associates.  Site visits may be required of the contractor.  However, ship visits are not anticipated.   PHASE I CONTRACT REVIEW 1.	Review the MARAD functional requirements of the Ready Reserve Force Management System (RMS), as awarded to ABS Nautical Systems and ABS Consulting via the following contract instruments, and the latest modification: a.	DTMA1P05022 b.	DTMA1F05010 c.	DTMA1P05063 d.	DTMA1C06001 2. Review and analyze the fielded system, as now installed and deployed, and determine the extent that the fielded system capabilities match the prescribed Full Operational Capability (FOC) requirements as contracted for in the above contract instruments.

As such, any proposed use of the AIB will be keenly scrutinized by a significant number of interested parties, including the Congress, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the National Park Service, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, the District of Columbia State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and, of course, many interested public and private groups and individuals.

As owner and ultimate overseer of a number of irreplaceable assets on the Mall, as a longtime resident on the Mall, and as an institution that is devoted to furthering knowledge and an understanding of the nation's history, the Smithsonian is keenly focused on the appropriate preservation and re-use of the AIB.  The Smithsonian does not have funding now or in the foreseeable future to rehabilitate the AIB, given funding needs for its other actively-used building assets.  Accordingly, the Smithsonian is interested in considering proposals from private or other public sector users to redevelop and operate the building either under a license agreement or other long term arrangement and thereby return this important building to productive use.

This Request for Qualifications ("RFQ") is the first step in the process that may lead to selection of an AIB Redevelopment Entity ("RE").  If responses to this RFQ are promising, it is the Smithsonian's present intent to follow this RFQ with a second step consisting of a more focused and detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) that will be circulated only to a selected smaller group of finalist candidates.  However, the Smithsonian expressly reserves the right in its sole discretion not to proceed with an RFP or any subsequent negotiations or agreement, and this request shall not commit the Smithsonian to pay any preparation costs nor to make reimbursement for any of the costs associated with a response to this request.

The National Mall has been the symbolic heart of the United States for more than a century. More than 20 million visitors come to the Mall each year, visiting the Smithsonian museums - the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Hirshhorn Gallery and Sculpture Garden, the National Museum of African Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, and the Freer Gallery of Art - as well as the National Gallery of Art.   The Smithsonian is both the Nation's preeminent conservator and exhibitor of American culture and history and a defining presence on the National Mall.  Use of one of the key Mall buildings by a non-Smithsonian and possibly non-government user has few precedents and must be considered judiciously.  However, redevelopment of the AIB opens the possibility of bringing other exciting and important uses to the Mall and represents a unique opportunity for a visionary team to establish a presence on the Mall and form an association with a cultural institution of national and international importance. 

BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND ASSUMPTIONS

Considering the symbolic and practical magnitude of this decision, the Smithsonian has been very deliberate in its consideration of possible AIB redevelopment and reuse.  The Smithsonian is interested in a RE whose vision for AIB is compatible with the extraordinary importance of the building, its location, and the Smithsonian's mission to promote "the increase and diffusion of knowledge." 

	The Smithsonian will favor redevelopment concepts that will capitalize on AIB's extraordinary location, maximize the opportunity to bring the public into the building, attract visitors to the Mall, and add value to existing Smithsonian museums.

	Concepts for museum, theater or exhibition uses are welcome, assuming the uses do not duplicate the function or focus of other museums on the Mall.

	The Smithsonian will consider redevelopment approaches that include mission-related commercial use, exhibit use, conference use and/or mixed use retail. Importantly, any of these concepts for reuse must be compatible with the ambiance of the Mall and serve visitors to the Mall and Washington, D.C.

	One of the Smithsonian's goals is to preserve and protect traditional American cultural elements. Accordingly, any proposed use that furthers this objective will be of significant interest to Smithsonian.  The Smithsonian welcomes concepts that combine typical private sector redevelopment goals with educational, scientific, cultural, technological, or other like-minded elements. 

	The Smithsonian's preferred means of transferring control of the building is through a license agreement or other long term arrangement with the selected RE.  The Smithsonian will work with the selected team to structure a relationship that is appropriate given the commitments of both parties to the project.

	The Smithsonian will entertain proposals based on either publicly or privately sponsored redevelopment of the building.

	The Smithsonian has certain exclusive service contracts with which the selected RE will need to comply.  None of these contracts is of such form or magnitude that it should detract from the desirability or financial feasibility of the project. The Smithsonian will provide further information on these contracts and obligations as the process progresses. 

	The Smithsonian may choose to retain a portion of the AIB for internal exhibition or other traditional Smithsonian uses. These uses, if any, will be integrated with and be complementary to the redevelopment.  It is not anticipated that these uses, if any, will have a negative effect on the overall redevelopment opportunity.

	The RE will be responsible for all restoration costs and ongoing operating, maintenance and replacement expenses during the term. The applicability of Davis-Bacon wage rates should be assumed.

	The Smithsonian will not entertain concepts for uses that are inappropriate to the dignity of the Mall and to the general public that visit it.  Accordingly, uses such as nightclubs or similar commercial entertainment venues, residences, hotels, religious activities, or partisan political activities will not be considered.

	There is no parking facility available, only street parking.

	Any rehabilitation will be subject to oversight by the Smithsonian.

	It is expected that the RE will meet any necessary compliance reviews required by the District of Columbia and/or various agencies.

	The final redevelopment plan will be subject to approval by the Smithsonian's Board of Regents.
  
II. BUILDING DESCRIPTION

The Arts and Industries Building is the second oldest of the Smithsonian museums on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Initially called the National Museum, it was built to provide the Smithsonian with its first proper facility for public display of its growing collections. The building, designed by architects Adolf Cluss and Paul Schulze, opened in 1881 in time to host an inaugural ball for President James A. Garfield.  The approximate size of the building is 180,000 gross square feet. The building was designed as a symmetrical Greek cross in plan with a central rotunda. The exterior was constructed with geometric patterns of polychrome brick, and a sculpture entitled Columbia Protecting Science and Industry by sculptor Caspar Buberl was placed above the main entrance on the north side.  The interior of the building was partially lit through the use of skylights and clerestory windows.  

In 1910 the natural history collections were moved to the new National Museum of Natural History, and the old museum was given its present name in 1916. In 1964 the remaining exhibitions were moved to the National Museum of History and Technology, now known as the National Museum of American History. In 1976, the Arts and Industries Building reopened with 1876: A Centennial Exhibition, featuring objects from across the globe that had been displayed at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The building later housed temporary exhibitions and a children's theater, known as the Discovery Theater.  In 2004 the museum was closed to the public.  Until vacated in late 2006, certain Smithsonian departments occupied portions of the building for general office use.  

III. GENERAL STIPULATIONS

The Smithsonian has expended considerable effort exploring the redevelopment feasibility of the AIB and reviewing historical materials related to the physical structure. Accordingly, several important issues regarding the building must be considered in any redevelopment effort:

1.	As previously stated, the RE will be financially responsible for the building restoration, operations, and long term maintenance. The Smithsonian has examined numerous scenarios for redevelopment and applied preliminary costing to these scenarios.  Based on these costing efforts, the Smithsonian believes there are many future redevelopment scenarios (including those described in this offering) that are acceptable and appropriate for the building and that are financially viable. 

2.	Any reuse of the building must respect the basic interior elements of the AIB, including the major historic interior spaces (Rotunda, Halls, Ranges and Courts).  Any required rehabilitation of the exterior of the facility will have to meet historic preservation standards outlined in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Interior character-defining elements must be sensitively treated.  In general that means that some modern materials can be substituted for original materials, but the appearance of the exterior cannot be materially changed. 
 
3.	Any exterior signage will be subject to approval. The name etched on the outside of the building - National Museum - and the current name of the building "Arts and Industries" must be maintained. The building cannot be renamed for an individual, family, group, firm or corporation, although naming opportunities for interior spaces may be possible.

4.	The Smithsonian has conducted extensive reviews of the work necessary to make the building structurally and environmentally sound and to provide a "conditioned shell" ready for interior fitout. Cost estimates have assumed that the interior spaces will be reconfigured to their layout circa 1900, which anticipates removal of more recent partitioning and inserted floors.  The current estimates contemplate upgrading/replacing the previously replaced windows, providing appropriate security and fire protection, installing modern links to the on-site US General Services Administration heating and cooling district, but do not include the cost of distribution within the building. The estimate includes a complete replacement of the roof, including repair, reinforcement or replacement of the existing iron roof trusses.  Also included are simple wall finishes and associated soft costs.  The detailed cost estimates for this "conditioned shell" range from approximately $55 to $65 million.

Step Two of the process following the RFQ may be a more specific Request for Proposal (RFP) phase.  Only those potential REs who have responded to this RFQ and have submitted the best responses to the selection criteria will be invited to participate in the RFP process.  


IV. REQUIREMENTS 

This RFQ requests that the potential RE teams provide three distinct classes of information:  Qualifications, Vision, and Transaction Structure.  Responses should be detailed and comprehensive.

A.  QUALIFICATIONS
The primary goal of this process is to select an experienced and highly qualified RE that has the ability to finance and deliver a first class and appropriate redevelopment concept practically and expeditiously.  We are seeking in the RFQ stage basic background information about the RE team and its track record of performance. 

As part of the response, please provide us with specific information regarding the following:

For a Development Entity

	Please provide a general overview of your organization and partners that will be responsible for delivering the redevelopment of the building. Describe the roles of all key members related to the redevelopment and operation of the project.  Answer the following questions:  Who will lead the team?  Has the team worked together before and, if so, on what projects?  Does the team have historic redevelopment skills or experience?  Are any of the team members experienced in the Washington, DC, development market?  Please describe your experience with publicly funded entities and provide as many examples as possible of successful projects led by your organization.

For a Governmental, Non-Governmental, or other Non-Development Entity

	Please provide as much detail as possible about your organization. Answer the following question:  Where are you currently located, and what groups within your organization are you proposing to occupy AIB? 

For all Responses

	Provide your experience with license agreement development projects or similar structures. Answer the following questions:  What has the degree of success been (please be as specific as possible) in these relationships?  What have been the benefits and challenges of these structures for your projects?

	If you are selected as the RE to redevelop AIB, what do you anticipate the schedule to be for redevelopment completion and AIB occupancy? How will your group work with SI to make the redevelopment occur as smoothly as possible?

	Describe your organization's experience in 1) historic restoration, 2) managing and operating a large public facility, 3) providing a regularly scheduled maintenance and long-term system replacement strategy, and 4) providing security.

	Provide an overview of your organization's financial strength that will be relied upon for completion of this project.  We are very interested in the financial structure (preliminary, if necessary) that you would use, the structures you typically use and the entities/investors/financiers you typically work with on these developments, and the timing for including these entities.  Do you have the funds on hand to make this redevelopment happen or will a fundraising effort be required?   Discuss your previous fundraising campaigns and how your organization will generate funds for this endeavor.  Has your Board or top management already approved in concept a relocation or move of certain elements of your organization to the AIB?

B.  VISION FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT
The AIB occupies an extremely prominent position in the heart of the National Mall.  The Smithsonian, as the long term steward of the building, will carefully review and approve the final development plan for the building.  Please provide us with your preliminary vision and concept for the redevelopment.  Detail the challenges you see with the redevelopment. We are not seeking detailed renderings or architectural plans at this juncture.  Instead, we are seeking basic representations and descriptions of how your team would approach the opportunity and bring the vision to fruition.  Please explain why the proposed concept would be appropriate on the National Mall and how it would complement the Smithsonian's other museum offerings.

C.  TRANSACTION STRUCTURE 
SI has preliminarily identified a license agreement or other long term arrangement as the most appropriate type of relationship between the selected RE and SI.  However, please give us your perspective on how the redevelopment plan can best be structured.  Describe any additional transaction related (or control, or decision making) issues that are critical for you and your concept to be successful.  


V. RFQ SELECTION CRITERIA 
We anticipate that potential RE's will present outstanding qualifications, redevelopment vision, and transaction structure.  The RFQ proposals will be carefully evaluated against the following factors:

	Proposing creative, appropriate, and exciting reuse concepts that complement Smithsonian activity on the Mall and provide educational, cultural or other services to the Mall visitors; 
 
	Demonstrating past and current managerial capability that can carry this project to fruition;

	Preserving this historic asset while making the building into a productive asset for Smithsonian and the public; and 

	Demonstrating a well defined track record of successful operations, financial stability and the financial capability to proceed with full redevelopment within 24 months of execution of an agreement with the Smithsonian.

I.  OVERVIEW 

INTRODUCTION
The Smithsonian Institution (SI) invites and welcomes your participation in an exploration of development opportunities for the Arts and Industries Building (AIB). The AIB is a National Historic Landmark and is located directly adjacent to the Smithsonian Castle on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The building is one of approximately 2400 National Historic Landmarks designated by the Secretary of the Interior as of the highest significance to the American people.  As such, any proposed use of the AIB will be keenly scrutinized by a significant number of interested parties, including the Congress, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the National Park Service, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, the District of Columbia State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and, of course, many interested public and private groups and individuals.

As owner and ultimate overseer of a number of irreplaceable assets on the Mall, as a longtime resident on the Mall, and as an institution that is devoted to furthering knowledge and an understanding of the nation's history, the Smithsonian is keenly focused on the appropriate preservation and re-use of the AIB.

However, the Smithsonian expressly reserves the right in its sole discretion not to proceed with an RFP or any subsequent negotiations or agreement, and this request shall not commit the Smithsonian to pay any preparation costs nor to make reimbursement for any of the costs associated with a response to this request.

The National Mall has been the symbolic heart of the United States for more than a century. More than 20 million visitors come to the Mall each year, visiting the Smithsonian museums - the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Hirshhorn Gallery and Sculpture Garden, the National Museum of African Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, and the Freer Gallery of Art - as well as the National Gallery of Art.   The Smithsonian is both the Nation's preeminent conservator and exhibitor of American culture and history and a defining presence on the National Mall.  Use of one of the key Mall buildings by a non-Smithsonian and possibly non-government user has few precedents and must be considered judiciously.  However, redevelopment of the AIB opens the possibility of bringing other exciting and important uses to the Mall and represents a unique opportunity for a visionary team to establish a presence on the Mall and form an association with a cultural institution of national and international importance.

Until vacated in late 2006, certain Smithsonian departments occupied portions of the building for general office use.  

III. GENERAL STIPULATIONS

The Smithsonian has expended considerable effort exploring the redevelopment feasibility of the AIB and reviewing historical materials related to the physical structure. Accordingly, several important issues regarding the building must be considered in any redevelopment effort:

1.	As previously stated, the RE will be financially responsible for the building restoration, operations, and long term maintenance. The Smithsonian has examined numerous scenarios for redevelopment and applied preliminary costing to these scenarios.  Based on these costing efforts, the Smithsonian believes there are many future redevelopment scenarios (including those described in this offering) that are acceptable and appropriate for the building and that are financially viable. 

2.	Any reuse of the building must respect the basic interior elements of the AIB, including the major historic interior spaces (Rotunda, Halls, Ranges and Courts).  Any required rehabilitation of the exterior of the facility will have to meet historic preservation standards outlined in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Interior character-defining elements must be sensitively treated.  In general that means that some modern materials can be substituted for original materials, but the appearance of the exterior cannot be materially changed. 
 
3.	Any exterior signage will be subject to approval. The name etched on the outside of the building - National Museum - and the current name of the building "Arts and Industries" must be maintained. The building cannot be renamed for an individual, family, group, firm or corporation, although naming opportunities for interior spaces may be possible.

4.	The Smithsonian has conducted extensive reviews of the work necessary to make the building structurally and environmentally sound and to provide a "conditioned shell" ready for interior fitout. Cost estimates have assumed that the interior spaces will be reconfigured to their layout circa 1900, which anticipates removal of more recent partitioning and inserted floors.  The current estimates contemplate upgrading/replacing the previously replaced windows, providing appropriate security and fire protection, installing modern links to the on-site US General Services Administration heating and cooling district, but do not include the cost of distribution within the building. The estimate includes a complete replacement of the roof, including repair, reinforcement or replacement of the existing iron roof trusses.  Also included are simple wall finishes and associated soft costs.  The detailed cost estimates for this "conditioned shell" range from approximately $55 to $65 million.

Step Two of the process following the RFQ may be a more specific Request for Proposal (RFP) phase.  Only those potential REs who have responded to this RFQ and have submitted the best responses to the selection criteria will be invited to participate in the RFP process.  


IV. REQUIREMENTS 

This RFQ requests that the potential RE teams provide three distinct classes of information:  Qualifications, Vision, and Transaction Structure.  Responses should be detailed and comprehensive.

A.  QUALIFICATIONS
The primary goal of this process is to select an experienced and highly qualified RE that has the ability to finance and deliver a first class and appropriate redevelopment concept practically and expeditiously.

I.  OVERVIEW 

INTRODUCTION
The Smithsonian Institution (SI) invites and welcomes your participation in an exploration of development opportunities for the Arts and Industries Building (AIB). The AIB is a National Historic Landmark and is located directly adjacent to the Smithsonian Castle on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The building is one of approximately 2400 National Historic Landmarks designated by the Secretary of the Interior as of the highest significance to the American people.  As such, any proposed use of the AIB will be keenly scrutinized by a significant number of interested parties, including the Congress, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the National Park Service, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, the District of Columbia State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and, of course, many interested public and private groups and individuals.

As owner and ultimate overseer of a number of irreplaceable assets on the Mall, as a longtime resident on the Mall, and as an institution that is devoted to furthering knowledge and an understanding of the nation's history, the Smithsonian is keenly focused on the appropriate preservation and re-use of the AIB.  The Smithsonian does not have funding now or in the foreseeable future to rehabilitate the AIB, given funding needs for its other actively-used building assets.  Accordingly, the Smithsonian is interested in considering proposals from private or other public sector users to redevelop and operate the building either under a license agreement or other long term arrangement and thereby return this important building to productive use.

This Request for Qualifications ("RFQ") is the first step in the process that may lead to selection of an AIB Redevelopment Entity ("RE").  If responses to this RFQ are promising, it is the Smithsonian's present intent to follow this RFQ with a second step consisting of a more focused and detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) that will be circulated only to a selected smaller group of finalist candidates.  However, the Smithsonian expressly reserves the right in its sole discretion not to proceed with an RFP or any subsequent negotiations or agreement, and this request shall not commit the Smithsonian to pay any preparation costs nor to make reimbursement for any of the costs associated with a response to this request.

The National Mall has been the symbolic heart of the United States for more than a century. More than 20 million visitors come to the Mall each year, visiting the Smithsonian museums - the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Hirshhorn Gallery and Sculpture Garden, the National Museum of African Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, and the Freer Gallery of Art - as well as the National Gallery of Art.   The Smithsonian is both the Nation's preeminent conservator and exhibitor of American culture and history and a defining presence on the National Mall.  Use of one of the key Mall buildings by a non-Smithsonian and possibly non-government user has few precedents and must be considered judiciously.  However, redevelopment of the AIB opens the possibility of bringing other exciting and important uses to the Mall and represents a unique opportunity for a visionary team to establish a presence on the Mall and form an association with a cultural institution of national and international importance. 

BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND ASSUMPTIONS

Considering the symbolic and practical magnitude of this decision, the Smithsonian has been very deliberate in its consideration of possible AIB redevelopment and reuse.  The Smithsonian is interested in a RE whose vision for AIB is compatible with the extraordinary importance of the building, its location, and the Smithsonian's mission to promote "the increase and diffusion of knowledge." 

	The Smithsonian will favor redevelopment concepts that will capitalize on AIB's extraordinary location, maximize the opportunity to bring the public into the building, attract visitors to the Mall, and add value to existing Smithsonian museums.

	Concepts for museum, theater or exhibition uses are welcome, assuming the uses do not duplicate the function or focus of other museums on the Mall.

	The Smithsonian will consider redevelopment approaches that include mission-related commercial use, exhibit use, conference use and/or mixed use retail. Importantly, any of these concepts for reuse must be compatible with the ambiance of the Mall and serve visitors to the Mall and Washington, D.C.

	One of the Smithsonian's goals is to preserve and protect traditional American cultural elements. Accordingly, any proposed use that furthers this objective will be of significant interest to Smithsonian.  The Smithsonian welcomes concepts that combine typical private sector redevelopment goals with educational, scientific, cultural, technological, or other like-minded elements. 

	The Smithsonian's preferred means of transferring control of the building is through a license agreement or other long term arrangement with the selected RE.  The Smithsonian will work with the selected team to structure a relationship that is appropriate given the commitments of both parties to the project.

	The Smithsonian will entertain proposals based on either publicly or privately sponsored redevelopment of the building.

	The Smithsonian has certain exclusive service contracts with which the selected RE will need to comply.  None of these contracts is of such form or magnitude that it should detract from the desirability or financial feasibility of the project. The Smithsonian will provide further information on these contracts and obligations as the process progresses. 

	The Smithsonian may choose to retain a portion of the AIB for internal exhibition or other traditional Smithsonian uses. These uses, if any, will be integrated with and be complementary to the redevelopment.  It is not anticipated that these uses, if any, will have a negative effect on the overall redevelopment opportunity.

	The RE will be responsible for all restoration costs and ongoing operating, maintenance and replacement expenses during the term. The applicability of Davis-Bacon wage rates should be assumed.

	The Smithsonian will not entertain concepts for uses that are inappropriate to the dignity of the Mall and to the general public that visit it.  Accordingly, uses such as nightclubs or similar commercial entertainment venues, residences, hotels, religious activities, or partisan political activities will not be considered.

	There is no parking facility available, only street parking.

	Any rehabilitation will be subject to oversight by the Smithsonian.

	It is expected that the RE will meet any necessary compliance reviews required by the District of Columbia and/or various agencies.

	The final redevelopment plan will be subject to approval by the Smithsonian's Board of Regents.
  
II. BUILDING DESCRIPTION

The Arts and Industries Building is the second oldest of the Smithsonian museums on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Initially called the National Museum, it was built to provide the Smithsonian with its first proper facility for public display of its growing collections. The building, designed by architects Adolf Cluss and Paul Schulze, opened in 1881 in time to host an inaugural ball for President James A. Garfield.  The approximate size of the building is 180,000 gross square feet. The building was designed as a symmetrical Greek cross in plan with a central rotunda. The exterior was constructed with geometric patterns of polychrome brick, and a sculpture entitled Columbia Protecting Science and Industry by sculptor Caspar Buberl was placed above the main entrance on the north side.  The interior of the building was partially lit through the use of skylights and clerestory windows.  

In 1910 the natural history collections were moved to the new National Museum of Natural History, and the old museum was given its present name in 1916. In 1964 the remaining exhibitions were moved to the National Museum of History and Technology, now known as the National Museum of American History. In 1976, the Arts and Industries Building reopened with 1876: A Centennial Exhibition, featuring objects from across the globe that had been displayed at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The building later housed temporary exhibitions and a children's theater, known as the Discovery Theater.  In 2004 the museum was closed to the public.  Until vacated in late 2006, certain Smithsonian departments occupied portions of the building for general office use.  

III. GENERAL STIPULATIONS

The Smithsonian has expended considerable effort exploring the redevelopment feasibility of the AIB and reviewing historical materials related to the physical structure. Accordingly, several important issues regarding the building must be considered in any redevelopment effort:

1.	As previously stated, the RE will be financially responsible for the building restoration, operations, and long term maintenance. The Smithsonian has examined numerous scenarios for redevelopment and applied preliminary costing to these scenarios.  Based on these costing efforts, the Smithsonian believes there are many future redevelopment scenarios (including those described in this offering) that are acceptable and appropriate for the building and that are financially viable. 

2.	Any reuse of the building must respect the basic interior elements of the AIB, including the major historic interior spaces (Rotunda, Halls, Ranges and Courts).  Any required rehabilitation of the exterior of the facility will have to meet historic preservation standards outlined in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Interior character-defining elements must be sensitively treated.  In general that means that some modern materials can be substituted for original materials, but the appearance of the exterior cannot be materially changed. 
 
3.	Any exterior signage will be subject to approval. The name etched on the outside of the building - National Museum - and the current name of the building "Arts and Industries" must be maintained. The building cannot be renamed for an individual, family, group, firm or corporation, although naming opportunities for interior spaces may be possible.

4.	The Smithsonian has conducted extensive reviews of the work necessary to make the building structurally and environmentally sound and to provide a "conditioned shell" ready for interior fitout. Cost estimates have assumed that the interior spaces will be reconfigured to their layout circa 1900, which anticipates removal of more recent partitioning and inserted floors.  The current estimates contemplate upgrading/replacing the previously replaced windows, providing appropriate security and fire protection, installing modern links to the on-site US General Services Administration heating and cooling district, but do not include the cost of distribution within the building. The estimate includes a complete replacement of the roof, including repair, reinforcement or replacement of the existing iron roof trusses.  Also included are simple wall finishes and associated soft costs.  The detailed cost estimates for this "conditioned shell" range from approximately $55 to $65 million.

Step Two of the process following the RFQ may be a more specific Request for Proposal (RFP) phase.  Only those potential REs who have responded to this RFQ and have submitted the best responses to the selection criteria will be invited to participate in the RFP process.  


IV. REQUIREMENTS 

This RFQ requests that the potential RE teams provide three distinct classes of information:  Qualifications, Vision, and Transaction Structure.  Responses should be detailed and comprehensive.

A.  QUALIFICATIONS
The primary goal of this process is to select an experienced and highly qualified RE that has the ability to finance and deliver a first class and appropriate redevelopment concept practically and expeditiously.  We are seeking in the RFQ stage basic background information about the RE team and its track record of performance. 

As part of the response, please provide us with specific information regarding the following:

For a Development Entity

	Please provide a general overview of your organization and partners that will be responsible for delivering the redevelopment of the building. Describe the roles of all key members related to the redevelopment and operation of the project.  Answer the following questions:  Who will lead the team?  Has the team worked together before and, if so, on what projects?  Does the team have historic redevelopment skills or experience?  Are any of the team members experienced in the Washington, DC, development market?  Please describe your experience with publicly funded entities and provide as many examples as possible of successful projects led by your organization.

For a Governmental, Non-Governmental, or other Non-Development Entity

	Please provide as much detail as possible about your organization. Answer the following question:  Where are you currently located, and what groups within your organization are you proposing to occupy AIB? 

For all Responses

	Provide your experience with license agreement development projects or similar structures. Answer the following questions:  What has the degree of success been (please be as specific as possible) in these relationships?  What have been the benefits and challenges of these structures for your projects?

	If you are selected as the RE to redevelop AIB, what do you anticipate the schedule to be for redevelopment completion and AIB occupancy? How will your group work with SI to make the redevelopment occur as smoothly as possible?

	Describe your organization's experience in 1) historic restoration, 2) managing and operating a large public facility, 3) providing a regularly scheduled maintenance and long-term system replacement strategy, and 4) providing security.

	Provide an overview of your organization's financial strength that will be relied upon for completion of this project.  We are very interested in the financial structure (preliminary, if necessary) that you would use, the structures you typically use and the entities/investors/financiers you typically work with on these developments, and the timing for including these entities.  Do you have the funds on hand to make this redevelopment happen or will a fundraising effort be required?   Discuss your previous fundraising campaigns and how your organization will generate funds for this endeavor.  Has your Board or top management already approved in concept a relocation or move of certain elements of your organization to the AIB?

B.  VISION FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT
The AIB occupies an extremely prominent position in the heart of the National Mall.  The Smithsonian, as the long term steward of the building, will carefully review and approve the final development plan for the building.  Please provide us with your preliminary vision and concept for the redevelopment.  Detail the challenges you see with the redevelopment. We are not seeking detailed renderings or architectural plans at this juncture.  Instead, we are seeking basic representations and descriptions of how your team would approach the opportunity and bring the vision to fruition.  Please explain why the proposed concept would be appropriate on the National Mall and how it would complement the Smithsonian's other museum offerings.

C.  TRANSACTION STRUCTURE 
SI has preliminarily identified a license agreement or other long term arrangement as the most appropriate type of relationship between the selected RE and SI.  However, please give us your perspective on how the redevelopment plan can best be structured.  Describe any additional transaction related (or control, or decision making) issues that are critical for you and your concept to be successful.  


V. RFQ SELECTION CRITERIA 
We anticipate that potential RE's will present outstanding qualifications, redevelopment vision, and transaction structure.  The RFQ proposals will be carefully evaluated against the following factors:

	Proposing creative, appropriate, and exciting reuse concepts that complement Smithsonian activity on the Mall and provide educational, cultural or other services to the Mall visitors; 
 
	Demonstrating past and current managerial capability that can carry this project to fruition;

	Preserving this historic asset while making the building into a productive asset for Smithsonian and the public; and 

	Demonstrating a well defined track record of successful operations, financial stability and the financial capability to proceed with full redevelopment within 24 months of execution of an agreement with the Smithsonian.

IV. SUBMITTAL INFORMATION

The Smithsonian intends to solicit input and interest in this opportunity through a variety of avenues.  It is the intention of the internal Smithsonian selection group to offer this opportunity to an international audience over the next 60 days.

The National Mall has been the symbolic heart of the United States for more than a century. More than 20 million visitors come to the Mall each year, visiting the Smithsonian museums - the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Hirshhorn Gallery and Sculpture Garden, the National Museum of African Art, the Arthur M.

For a Governmental, Non-Governmental, or other Non-Development Entity

	Please provide as much detail as possible about your organization. Answer the following question:  Where are you currently located, and what groups within your organization are you proposing to occupy AIB? 

For all Responses

	Provide your experience with license agreement development projects or similar structures. Answer the following questions:  What has the degree of success been (please be as specific as possible) in these relationships?  What have been the benefits and challenges of these structures for your projects?

	If you are selected as the RE to redevelop AIB, what do you anticipate the schedule to be for redevelopment completion and AIB occupancy? How will your group work with SI to make the redevelopment occur as smoothly as possible?

	Describe your organization's experience in 1) historic restoration, 2) managing and operating a large public facility, 3) providing a regularly scheduled maintenance and long-term system replacement strategy, and 4) providing security.

	Provide an overview of your organization's financial strength that will be relied upon for completion of this project.  We are very interested in the financial structure (preliminary, if necessary) that you would use, the structures you typically use and the entities/investors/financiers you typically work with on these developments, and the timing for including these entities.  Do you have the funds on hand to make this redevelopment happen or will a fundraising effort be required?   Discuss your previous fundraising campaigns and how your organization will generate funds for this endeavor.  Has your Board or top management already approved in concept a relocation or move of certain elements of your organization to the AIB?

B.  VISION FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT
The AIB occupies an extremely prominent position in the heart of the National Mall.  The Smithsonian, as the long term steward of the building, will carefully review and approve the final development plan for the building.  Please provide us with your preliminary vision and concept for the redevelopment.  Detail the challenges you see with the redevelopment. We are not seeking detailed renderings or architectural plans at this juncture.  Instead, we are seeking basic representations and descriptions of how your team would approach the opportunity and bring the vision to fruition.  Please explain why the proposed concept would be appropriate on the National Mall and how it would complement the Smithsonian's other museum offerings.

C.  TRANSACTION STRUCTURE 
SI has preliminarily identified a license agreement or other long term arrangement as the most appropriate type of relationship between the selected RE and SI.  However, please give us your perspective on how the redevelopment plan can best be structured.  Describe any additional transaction related (or control, or decision making) issues that are critical for you and your concept to be successful.  


V. RFQ SELECTION CRITERIA 
We anticipate that potential RE's will present outstanding qualifications, redevelopment vision, and transaction structure.  The RFQ proposals will be carefully evaluated against the following factors:

	Proposing creative, appropriate, and exciting reuse concepts that complement Smithsonian activity on the Mall and provide educational, cultural or other services to the Mall visitors; 
 
	Demonstrating past and current managerial capability that can carry this project to fruition;

	Preserving this historic asset while making the building into a productive asset for Smithsonian and the public; and 

	Demonstrating a well defined track record of successful operations, financial stability and the financial capability to proceed with full redevelopment within 24 months of execution of an agreement with the Smithsonian.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This action is to support PM FBCB2 ongoing efforts in support of wartime operat ions and the continuation of the Full Rate Production phase of the computer systems. There will be no change to the existing period of performance which runs through 2011, not to include the one year option period.

<DESC>Note: This modification is to clarify the closing date of 11/05/04 for this Announcement. The U.S. Geological Survey, WRD in Middleton, WI seeks to make a non-competitive award to Omni Resources, Inc (No.08ER14-NoSolicitation). The work is a logical follow-on to an on-going task involving both the development and deployment of a database and accompanying web service for USGS Water Quality data. Additionally, this contractor will also develop and implement an XML Schema for the National Water Information System. Omni Resources is the incumbent contractor already well-versed in USGS IT infrastructure and protocols. Several key deliverables are due before the end of the 2007 and product integrity and continuity are essential to these efforts. The follow-on nature of this work is to last no more than ten (10) months at a total cost well within the simplified acquisition threshold. THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The anticipated award date is 11/06/2007, under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold for commercial items.  NAICS is 541511.  Responses to this notice must be submitted to http://ideasec.nbc.gov. Via e-mail to: fjones@usgs.gov by 11/06/2007.  No additional synopsis will be published.

Additional Information (29 Jun 07): T-38C Improved Braking System Program (IBSP) Drawings Available Upon  Request The drawings referenced in section two of the wheel and brake notional  system/testing baseline for the T-38C IBSP are now available.  To request  a copy, please email Karen Shelley at Karen.Shelley@wpafb.af.mil. Addition Information (29 Jun 07): The attached questions and answers were taken from Panel Discussions at  T-38C IBSP Industry Days on 12 Jun 07. Addition Information: The attached performance specifications were developed during a two year  risk reduction activity.  These performance specifications define key  envelope information, desired system performance and testing requirements.  The attached specifications are provided as a baseline reference to aid in  the development and qualification of your proposed design.  In the  interest of best value, potential offerors are encouraged to review and  propose any improvements and/or modifications to the performance  specifications. 1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a  better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot Schools 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are  solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this  RFI. 4. Contractors interested in responding to the request shall provide  answers to the attached questions in the order indicated below and provide  any additional information to this office by COB 9 Feb 07. Please send correspondence to Attn: Capt Brandon Ledbetter, Program Manager (937) 904-4162 e-mail brandon.ledbetter@wpafb.af.mil or Mr. George Sarmiento, Program Manager (937) 904-4307, george.sarmiento@wpafb.af.mil   Please limit your response  to no more than 10 single-sided 8 ½ x 11 pages, double-spaced, minimum 12 point  font size. 1 Attachment RFI Questions Attachment 1 RFI Questions 1.

<DESC>CORRECTION:  This action published in the FBO on 20 April 2007 is amended as follows:

In the first paragraph under "Description" delete the second through the fifth sentences and replace with the following:


The primary purpose is to conduct subsurface investigations with subsequent geotechnical/foundation analysis- including monitoring, sampling and analysis of soil and groundwater for geotechnical properties and environmental contamination using various field and laboratory tests and construction or materials testing and engineering inspection  services.  On occasion, engineering services involving consultation on, or the inspection and evaluation of materials or site conditions during the design, the construction, or after construction (such as slope stability analysis, earthwork-related site improvements, foundations, concrete and bituminous pavements, etc.) will be required.  The general intention is to provide for such engineering services as necessary to support the construction and maintenance of facilities.  For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as the preparation of technical reports, studies, engineering investigations, wetland delineation and mapping, cost estimates, surveys (property, topographic, hydrographic, etc.), shop drawing reviews, construction related consultation and inspection may be required.  Typically consultant?s office or field travel time will be no greater than 7 days on a specific task order.  Materials engineering consultation and inspection services will be negotiated on an as-needed basis and need not be by in-house consultants.


At the beginning of the paragraph following the listing of Laboratory Accreditation Authorities insert - "1.  ".

All other information remains unchanged.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) hereby amends the combined synopsis/solicitation which was posted in FedBizOps on June 28, 2002, entitled "Serial Subscription Services", to respond to questions received from potential offerors:

1.  Question: Do we need to submit four lists with pricing by title for this solicitation or is the overall pricing structure as listed under the heading Proposal Requirement - Pricing sufficient?

Response: In accordance with Proposal Requirement - Pricing, of the subject combined synopsis/solicitation, offerors shall provide the NRC with pricing information by title for a "five year" period (i.e,. base year and four one year option periods) which shall include the offeror's pricing information for each subscription and handling charge for each year.

2.  Question: As the response date is 11th July, are we able to request an extension to allow for the holiday closure dates of this office?

Response: The NRC is unable to extend the due date for receipt of proposals because an award must be made not later than August 2002, to allow the successful offeror sufficient time to renew  subscription orders prior to the current expiration date(s).

3.  Question:  Would you accept consultant as a bidder with a very reputable subscription agency doing the actual work.

Response: As reflected in the solicitation, businesses, large and small, interested in teaming arrangements, should send their business information (i.e., name, address, contact name and phone number, and size of business) to Brenda J. DuBose, Contract Specialist at  bjd2@nrc.gov not later than 12:00 noon on July 8, 2002.  Offerors are hereby notified that the due date for submission of business information for teaming arrangements as reflected in the June 28, 2002 edition of FedBizOps has been revised from June 19, 2002 to 12:00 noon on July 8, 2002.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS HEREBY CANCELLED IN ITS ENTIRETY --THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY - The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with The Federal Employee Education and Assistant Fund (FEEA), 8441 West Bowles Avenue, Littleton, CO  80123 to provide professional services to administer HRSA's Child Care Tuition Assistant Program.  

On September 28, 1999, Congress passes Public Law 106-58, Sec. 643 (hereafter the act), which permits federal agencies to assist their lower income federal employees with the cost of childcare.  Tuition assistance can reduce the amount of tuition that parents pay for childcare by providing subsidies directly to the childcare provider.  To be eligible to participate, a childcare provider must be a family childcare home or childcare center licensed and/or regulated by the State and/or local authorities where the service is provided.  FEEA is the only organization with experience in administering childcare tuition assistance programs for federal agencies.  FEEA has the ability to receive a specified sum of money from HRSA and distribute it to childcare providers as tuition assistance funds.

This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.  The period of performance is for a period of twelve (12) months with four (4) twelve (12) month option periods.   In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file, which states and supports that FEEA is the only organization that can provide these services.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

During IOC, the observatory will have limited observation opportunities.	Once fully operational, the aircraft will have the capability for approximately 1000 observation hours per year over 20 years. SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy) carries a gyro-stabilized 2.5 meter telescope into the dry stratosphere, to permit observations of radiation of celestial objects at wavelengths from the visual and into the far-infrared and sub-millimeter.  Development of SOFIA was directly inspired by the success of the Gerard Kuiper Airborne Observatory, a NASA aircraft that carried a gyro-stabilized 0.9-meter telescope. The SOFIA aircraft is a Boeing 747-SP originally configured as a commercial passenger aircraft for Pan American Airlines. The aircraft was completely overhauled and modified to accommodate the Observatory sub-systems including: a gyro-stabilized 2.5-meter telescope; an on board mission control area; a telescope cavity with cavity door; and a cavity environment system.  2. Description Under this RFI, NASA solicits interest primarily from domestic and international universities, organizations, and research foundations to participate as a partner in SOFIA operations.  For domestic partners, NASA intends to use its authority under the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended ("Space Act"), to enter into a reimbursable agreement where each party funds their own participation as a percentage of observation time.  International partnerships may be established on a no-exchange-of-funds basis or through a reimbursable agreement. Currently NASA is funding 80% of the program and the German space agency, DLR, is funding 20%.  The goal is to reduce NASAs share of the program from 80% and allow a partner the prospect to conduct observations of its choosing within the technical constraints of the SOFIA observatory.  NASA is focused on creating a substantial long-term commitment from the respective partner with a partnership agreement of between 3 and 10 years.	The goal of this partnership is to have a new partner obtain 20% of NASAs share of the observatory time which will include over 150 observation hours per year, once fully operational.  The annual cost for a partner supporting the program at this level is approximately $15M per year. The new partner will have access to flight and science operations and infrastructure which includes: 	Ability to conduct observations of its choosing within the technical constraints of the SOFIA in many locations around the world.  Primary locations are NASA, Dryden in Southern California (its home base) and Christchurch, New Zealand. 	Fully operational and maintained aircraft and telescope assembly with aircrew and support staff. 	Ability to fly scientists on the aircraft for the observations. 	Ability to fly educators and students on the aircrafts classroom, once fully operational. 	Aircraft access to perform instrument checkout on the ground prior to flights. 	Access and use of SOFIA ground based labs at NASA Dryden and NASA Ames. 	Access and use of SOFIA data archiving and storage infrastructure. 	Ability to use existing NASA funded instruments or partner can design and build instruments. 3. Process NASA Headquarters oversees the SOFIA program that is managed by the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, with the Science project led out of the NASA Ames Research Center and the Airborne Platform project led out of NASA Dryden Flight Research Center.  NASA Headquarters is providing the opportunity for partners to join the program and lead a percentage of SOFIAs observation time.  4.

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) is seeking sources to perform Organizational Level Maintenance in support of the Marine Corps RESET Project.  Support is required for the following Marine Corps Aircraft: AV-8B, FA-18A+/C/D, EA-6B, C-130J, AH-1W/Z, UH-1N/Y, CH-46E, CH-53D/E and MV-22.  Support will be required both inside and outside the Continental United States (CONUS) at the following locations: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Camp Pendleton, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; MCAS Yuma, AZ; MCAS Cherry Point, NC; MCAS New River, SC; MCAS Beaufort, SC; MCAS Kaneohe, HI; MCAS Futenma, Okinawa Japan; Al Asad, Iraq.  Services may also be required at other OCONUS locations in support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT).

The primary goal of the Marine Corps RESET Project is to maintain each of the aircraft identified above in its optimal material condition.  In order to achieve this goal, the RESET Project will employ a special program of Conditional Inspections and Phased Maintenance which will include inspection, cleaning, corrosion treatment, servicing, disassembly, reassembly, repair and select mandatory replacement of parts.  This program will feature three distinct RESET events for each aircraft:

(1) A PRESET, which will be performed on all aircraft leaving for the Global War on Terror (GWOT), in order to establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level prior to deployment;
(2) A RECONSTITUTION, which will be performed on all aircraft returning from the GWOT, in order to re-establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level; 
(3) IN THEATRE SUSTAINMENT which will be performed as needed on all deployed Aircraft in GWOT operations, in order to maintain the material condition of the aircraft at the level that was established during the PRESET.

These events will be performed according to a set schedule, although some variability in this schedule is expected because of the exigencies of the battlefield and the needs of the operational units in question.

A secondary goal of the RESET Project is for the contractor to reduce the maintenance burden on Organizational Level Marines by performing general Organizational Level Maintenance when not engaged in activities to support the RESET events outlined above.

The Government anticipates releasing a single solicitation from which multiple IDIQ contracts will be awarded.  Requirements in the solicitation will be divided on an aircraft platform by aircraft platform basis.  The Government may award as few as one (1) or as many as nine (9) contracts and anticipates that portions of this requirement will be subject to Full and Open Competition, and small business and 8(a) competitions only.  The Government anticipates that this effort shall be awarded on a predominantly Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) basis, though the contract shall contain some Cost-Plus or Time and Material elements to address the secondary goal outlined above.  The Government will make final decisions on the set-asides based on market research and responses from this Request for Information (RFI), as well as other procurement and program related criteria.

Interested parties are requested to provide information on their ability to satisfy any or all of the requirements outlined above.  Information should be provided by electronic mail to Mr. Gregory Lee at gregory.lee@navy.mil, with a copy to Ms. Rita Pegg at rita.pegg@navy.mil.  At a minimum, responses should include company name, size of business, point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), and a list of contracts within the past five (5) years under which the interested party has performed the same or similar work.  The deadline for submission of information is 7 Dec 07 at 2:30 pm.  This information is being requested for purposes of market research.  The Government will use this information to develop a list of potential bidders which will be published at a later date.    

Questions concerning this notice should be submitted to Mr. Gregory Lee with a copy to Ms. Rita Pegg at the email addresses cited above.  Telephone requests for information WILL NOT be accepted.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
AN/TPS-75 Radar Solid State Modulator
Hill AFB UT
10 October 2007

  
This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis/RFI for the production of a solid state modulator system to replace the current high voltage modulator in the AN/TPS-75 Radar transmitter.

1.	Purpose. 
  
The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify potential providers of an AN/TPS-75 solid state modulator.  Also, the RFI included within this synopsis allows interested industry and other parties the opportunity to provide comments for the interface development of their solid state modulator into the AN/TPS-75.  The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time; this announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for any response preparation cost.  The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this sources sought synopsis. Copies of the submitted information will be reproduced and submitted to the AN/TPS-75 sustainment office for review and will be used to develop the acquisition strategy and possibly an eventual Request For Proposal (RFP).

2.	Background.  


a.	The AN/TPS-75 is a tactical radar that provides long-range radar coverage in remote, areas of operation worldwide.  

b.	The transmitter modulator is a high failure system and contains two single points of failure.  Current plans call for replacing the current tube-driven modulator with a solid state system.  This will replace the Trigger Amplifier, the Shunt Regulator, the Pulse Forming Network, the SF6 Tank, the Focus Coil Power Supply and the Diode Stack.

c.	The new modulator must have the following operating characteristics:

1)	Draw the same or less power than the current modulator:  120/203 3-phase 400 Hz input voltage with current between 70 and 85 amperes dependent on Pulse Repetition Frequency

2)	Have the same or better efficiency than the current modulator.

3)	Have a projected Mean Time Between Critical Failures of 5000 hours or greater.

4)	Not require significant modifications to the existing TPS-75 shelter mounting system.

5)	Not exceed the weight bearing capability of the existing TPS-75 shelter.

6)	Provide power for the existing focus coil power supply.  This power supply must provide constant current to the focus coil as the resistance of the coil changes from as little as 20 Ohms to a maximum of 33 Ohms.

7)	Be compatible with the existing liquid and air cooling systems.

8)	Fit within the existing transmitter compartment, roughly 7 feet wide by 6.5 feet high by 3.5 feet deep.

9)	Provide required control and monitoring signals.

10)	Operate at a Pulse Recurring Frequency (PRF) of 235, 250 and 275 Fixed and 250 and 275 Staggered.

d.	Produce a modulator pulse with the following characteristics:
 
1)	Pulse width of 8 microseconds (at the 95 percent point).

2)	Rise/Fall times of 1 microsecond approximately

3)	 Voltage of 117,000 Volts.

4)	Compatible with a Twystron vacuum tube.

e.	In conjunction with installation of a new modulator, the Air Force anticipates the need for a new management and monitoring system.  This system shall be mounted on the transmitter compartment door, shall be automated and shall provide diagnostic, failure and control functions.  Specific functions include, but are not limited to monitoring, control, and display and storage of key signals.


3. 	Program Overview.  

The purpose of this sources sought is to determine possible manufacturers and suppliers to provide a fit and function replacement of the existing modulator with the previously defined performance characteristics.

4.  Information for Interested Parties.  

a.	Draft RFP.  There is currently no scheduled timeline for proceeding with this effort and thus no anticipated Draft RFP availability date.

b.  	Bidder?s Library.  If this procurement is pursued, it is anticipated that an electronic Bidder?s Library will be established for this acquisition.  Please check the web site in paragraph 5 below for information and updates regarding the Bidder?s Library.  

c.	Industry Day.  No industry day is currently planned for this procurement.  

5.  Market Survey / RFI Questions.  Please send your response to Brenda Collard at OO-ALC/LHKC 6021 Gum Lane, Bldg 1228 Hill AFB UT 84056-5838 or via e-mail at Brenda.collard@hill.af.mil.

<DESC>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215 3 (OCT 1997).  The purpose of this request is to solicit an expression of interest and potential capability for building a ground station that will track, demodulate, and locate distress signals emitted by 406 MHz EPIRBs, SSAS beacons, ELTs, and PLBs, and relayed through bent pipe repeaters on board Global Positioning Satellites and other Mid Earth Orbiting satellites.  The ground station will be located in Hawaii and the data will be relayed to the United States Mission Control Center located in NOAA?s National Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, MD.  The ground station will have the capability to track multiple satellites simultaneously and locate the beacon signals that appear in three or more satellites.  Locations of distress signals are computed using difference of Time of Arrival (TOA) and Frequency of Arrival (FOA) algorithms on the beacon signal.  The ground station is intended to be used with another ground station located on the east coast of the United States such that the two ground stations together will provide coverage of the entire US Area of Responsibility (AOR).  Ground stations in the Cospas-Sarsat system are referred to as Local User Terminals or LUTs.  The Mid-Earth Orbiting LUT will be referred to as a MEOLUT.  See attached for details on the RFI.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute plans to renew the requirement for the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study.  Specifically, a Coordinating Center and four Field Centers will be sought to perform a five year follow-up of this population-based cohort study. The study was initiated in 1983 and involved the recruitment and examination of a total of 5,115 young adult men and women from four communities across the U.S.  Since the baseline examination in 1985, this cohort has been followed for changes in and development of coronary heart disease risk factors and development of atherosclerosis.  The incumbent contractors for the CARDIA Study are: Coordinating Center - University of Alabama in Birmingham; Field Centers - University of Alabama in Birmingham, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and Kaiser Foundation Research Institute. The main goal of the study renewal is to identify risk factors for and assess racial differences in the development and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis.  The continued follow-up and examination of the CARDIA study will address the following five objectives:

1.	Assess the impact of timing and varying levels of risk factors throughout young adulthood on the development of subclinical ventricular, vascular, and pulmonary function abnormalities in mid-life
2.	Examine young adult antecedents and consequences of obesity and the longitudinal relationships and interactions among adiposity, insulin resistance, and inflammation
3.	Identify determinants and trajectories of subclinical disease development in women during menopause transition compared to men of similar age
4.	Further assess the basis for racial differences in subclinical disease development
5.	Provide a platform for in-depth ancillary studies in cardiovascular and other areas

This requirement will call for an extensive comparison of the ongoing study, which will cover an examination and continued follow-up of the cohort.  This will involve administering an eighth clinical examination of the surviving members of the original participants; continued performance of follow-up for morbidity and mortality; and performance of comprehensive laboratory and statistical activities, data analysis, and scientific publications efforts utilizing CARDIA data.  The estimated award date will be September 30, 2008.

All responsible sources are encouraged to submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants by Friday, November 16, 2007. Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This notice will close fifteen days after posting.  This is not a request for proposals. All parties interested in this opportunity should contact the Contracting Officer, Cheryl Jennings, cj19f@nih.gov, 301-435-0347 or the Contracts Specialist, Jeffrey Williams, williamsja2@nhlbi.nih.gov, at 301-435-0338 for further details.

<RESPDATE>121407
<ARCHDATE>02122008
<CONTACT>Belinda C. Brown, (407) 380-8048
<DESC>The Government is in need of supplies and services to provide highly realistic vocational training through exercises requiring the student to perform basic electronic tasks.  Trainers consist of a computerized instructional device with the capability  for computer-based instruction and hands-on practical exercise training.  The Basic Electronics Maintenance Trainer (BEMT) will be a stand-alone, non-system training device designed to support the training of students in all aspects of basic electronics, including theory and hands-on application.   The BEMT will provide a highly realistic training environment through various training scenarios, that will require students to perform basic electronics tasks and allow instructors and administers to assign les son modules to either a class of students or individual students as well as track their progress.   	The standard system configuration classroom components will be an Instructor Operation Station (IOS) networked to multiple Student Stations (SS) and various test consoles and diagnostic equipment to support the MOS skills being trained.  The BEMT will sup port critical basic electronics training at Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) institutions, National Guard and Army Reserve readiness training sites for more than 40 Military Occupational Specialties (MOS).   The system will be configured with Commerc ial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment consisting of computer aided instructional devices (CAI), and have the capability for computer-based instruction, traditional text based learning, and hands-on practical exercise training.   	The SS will consist of a personal computer running proprietary software connected to the system training console.  The system will use associated training circuit cards to build experiments designed to demonstrate principles of electricity/electronics, au tomated power supply adjustments, fault insertion, fault clearing, and process monitoring.  In the stand-alone mode, power and faults will be manually inserted.  The BEMT will allow students to diagnose and/or locate fault insertion using Test, Measurement , and Diagnostic Equipment (logic probes, multimeters, oscilloscopes, function generators).  	The system must allow the instructor to lead students through a training scenario and then engage in hands-on practical exercises to reinforce the concepts.  The IOS will host all of the student records, lesson assignments and monitoring software.  Additi onally, the BEMT will include the capability to use computer aided instruction software to allow students the ability to engage in self-paced study.  The IOS is required to have control of the training system and collection of student performance data.  Th e IOS will also provide the capability to create and modify the learning environment and monitor student performance.   	The system operation will require students to have a pre-wired AC/DC power supply system, an input-output system and an in-circuit faulting system.  The test console should contain two selectable, pre-set DC power supplies, an AC power supply, and three s ites of connectors (receptacles) for insertion of printed circuit (PC) cards.  Experiment circuits, will be produced by inserting up to three PC cards into the PC connectors, with the capability to be faulted instantly to provide realistic, comprehensive t roubleshooting experience.  DC voltages should be selected by a simple control that can be monitored on the built-in LED indicator and an illuminated LCD display.   	The BEMT must provide continuous safety monitoring, and the ability to interrupt the experiment in the event of shorts, misuse, or current overload.  The BEMT safety and health hazards will be limited to and/or not greater than tripping hazards from netwo rk cables, sharp edges from tables or obvious office/classroom facility furniture/equipment and potential electrical shock hazards.  BEMT components will be networked via ethernet cables along with multiple power and co mmunications cables.  All cabling will be routed and bundled as necessary to keep wires and cables away from pedestrian traffic areas in the training facility to prevent injury and/or system damage.  All parts should be grounded through the main power cabl es to the ground terminals.  Power cables must be of sufficient size to carry the required current.  PVC cabling shall be avoided where possible. The training console must be able to accommodate 26 Volts DC (or greater).  The residual hazard of tripping wi ll be of marginal severity with remote probability (lowest risk).  The primary objective is to provide a system that meets the mission need and is supportable at the lowest life-cycle cost.

The current vendors providing the products through the prime vendor with their market shares in the Region over the past 12 months (in %) are: Vendor	        $	        % Huntleigh	$289,844	86% Kendall	        $48,708	        14% Total:	        $338,552	100% At the request of the Northwest Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, information, a nd itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.  Instructions to Offerors If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, and (3) your answers to the technical questions/criteria below to Patricia.Cordi er@us.army.mil no later than 7 December, 2007. (4) Please email product literature only to: Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR  at patricia.cordier@us.army.mil This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that ea ch submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission. D.  Selection Procedures Phase I: 1.  The sources sought notice will be posted to the FBO for a period of five weeks (35 days until 7 December, 2007).  2.  Vendors will respond to the FBO posting and provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria. 3.  The TRBO team will compile the technical/company criteria responses and send to the CPT for review. 4.  The CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria. 5.  The vendors who met the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical evaluation process. Phase II: 1.  The TRBO will request that vendors send requested sample set directly to participating MTFs.  (Requests will include notice date; the date which identified products must be delivered to the MTFs, the products that will be evaluated by a general descrip tion, the number of samples required, and addresses to send the products.)  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be eliminated from the standardization process. 2.  Vendors will provide samples at no charge to the government.  Unused sample products will not be returned.   3.  CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical (performance) criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like format with a 1-7 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Slightly Disagree; 4 = Undecided; 5 = Slightly  Agree; 6 = Agree; 7 = Strongly Agree). The CPT has set a target clinical acceptability threshold of 4.1 for acceptability of products for standardization. All clinical criteria are weighted equally.  4.  Clinical evaluations and comments will be tabulated by the TRBO, CPT will review results and the CPT recommendation will be forwarded to the Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) for review. Phase III: 1.  4.1 is a target clinical acceptability threshold.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 4.1 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near 4.1.  Below this threshold, products will be unacc eptable clinically and not eligible for consideration for standardization and will not be considered further. Those vendors meeting the threshold will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis.  2.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain  the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total req uirements of the MTFs in the Northwest Region).  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.   3.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. 4.  All vendors will provide pricing responses electronically by e-mail.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from issue of notice date to submit pri cing.  Vendors that fail to meet the pricing deadline will be disqualified.  5.  Price analysis will be forwarded to the TPRB for review.  Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with three possible one-year option periods (agreement not to exceed 5 years). You are required to offer prices lower than your DAPA prices or you will be disqualified. 6.  Clinical (Performance) evaluation is more important than the price. 7.  The TPRB reviews the data for a best value decision. 8.  The DSL will ensure that proposed prices (discounts off of DAPA), volume purchasing commitment and technical merit of the offer are a good value for the region.    9.  The TPRB votes for the best value. 10.  The TRBO develops decision document and submits to DSCP for approval. 11.  RIA is initiated with selected vendor and TPRB/MTFs notified. Technical Criteria 1.  Your company will provide a full line of devices and supplies for DVT prevention.  List the types of technology available in your line (i.e., pneumatic compression, foot pump, etc.) 2.

<SUBJECT>Future Business Opportunity
<DESC>This future opportunity announcement is to advise industry of the Governmentâs intention to procure engineering services to support the SPAWAR System Center, Charlestonâs (SSC Charlestonâs) mission to enable knowledge superiority for the Joint Warfighter through the development, acquisition and life cycle support of effective, integrated C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance), IT (Information Technology), and Space capabilities. Contingent upon approvals to proceed, SSC Charleston intends to issue one or more solicitations for Systems of Systems Engineering (SE) and End to End Test and Evaluation (T&E) services.  The intent of these acquisitions is to establish an engineering support framework consistent with SSC Charlestonâs transformation into a Competency Aligned Organization (CAO). The SE procurements will be managed under the 5.1 Competency and the T&E procurements managed under the 5.9 Competency.  Furthermore, these acquisitions are being pursued to better equip SSC Charleston with the commercial skill sets needed to develop requirements, evaluate options, implement and test a Service Oriented Common Computing Architecture that supports the infrastructure, application services which are developed, fielded and supported via separate contract vehicles. All awards will be made on a Competitive Best Value basis.   After approval to proceed, SSC Charleston will be conducting market research and performing market surveys in search of current industry best practices, innovation and the availability of small businesses as candidates for award as primes.  The government also intends to issue draft RFPs that will be posted on the SPAWAR e-commerce website under the SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston Future Opportunities Section.

<SUBJECT>R -- A-10 Prime Contract
<DESC>1 Nov 07

Government Responses to Industry Comments re: October 2007 RFI


General Response  

The Government appreciates industry comments to clarify or improve the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements for the forthcoming A-10 Prime Follow-On competition. Recommended word, sentence, and paragraph change suggestions to the PWS will be incorporated in the next update if determined prudent by the Government.

Concerning future activity, the Government will release a draft request for proposal (RFP) as part of its ongoing market research.  The draft RFP should be released by 2 November.  An A-10 Prime Follow-on Industry Days will be held at Hill AFB on 28-29 November. Individual one-on-one meetings will also be scheduled upon request during that time. Specific location, times and RSVP requirements will be released at a later date.

Finally, there were several questions posed to the Government in the Oct RFI responses from industry.  The following are short answers to those questions.   

1.  Section 2.2.3 ? states ?provide testing capability in artificial and real-time environments.? Is this intended to mean the contractor will have an A-10 flight simulator and ground maintenance trainers? 

GOVT:  The reference to a ?real-time? testing environment has been deleted from the PWS. 

2.  Section 2.2.3.1 ? states that the contractor ?be capable of supporting flight test requirements.? Is this intended to mean the contractor will have A-10 qualified flight test pilots on staff? 

GOVT:  No, the contractor will not be required to have A-10 flight test pilots on staff. The contractor?s role in flight test support usually includes flight test planning and data analysis.

3.  Sections 2.2.3.2 and 2.2.3.3 ? Does the AF have an A-10 avionics/software integration facility that would be available for contractor use as GFE to support these activities? Does the incumbent have these facilities? 

GOVT:  It is not likely that the current avionics/software integration facility will be available for contract use as it is partially owned by the incumbent and is currently supports ongoing avionics/software development, maintenance and test efforts.  The Government will provide a listing of GFE that is in use by the incumbent and will indicate any duplicate GFE which might be available to another contractor.

4.  The PWS does not clearly state if it is intended for the contractor team to sit on base at OO-ALC or if they expect them to have their own facility.  If it is a contractor facility does it make any difference where they are located? Please state where work is to be performed.

GOVT:  No, it is not necessary that the contractor be physically located at OO-ALC. However, work could be performed at multiple locations, dependent on the nature of the tasking, i.e., development efforts at development facilities, sustainment work performed at OO-ALC or corporate facilities, technical support activities at various field locations, etc. 

5.  There is a large Appendix D with the A-10 WBS but the PWS that does not reference the WBS be used.  It is only implied by its presence.  Will the IMP and IMS CDRLs call for the project to be organized using the A-10 WBS?

GOVT:   Yes, the A-10 WBS in Appendix D, as well as Appendices E & F, will be used for task/delivery orders that produce identifiable work products, whether they are hardware, software, data, facilities, or related services. The PWS will be updated to reflect the use of these documents when required by discrete orders.

6.  Please provide a section on Government Furnished Property (GFP) to include GFE & GFM.  Please include a section on Contractor Furnished Property (CFP) that is required on behalf of the contractor to provide as part of the contract.

GOVT:  The Government will provide a listing of available GFE/GFP/GFM in the data library.   CFP is dependent on the solution proposed by a contractor, which should consider their (or their team?s) capability in addition to the availability of GFP for a particular project. Individual task/delivery orders will address these requirements. 

7.  Recommend that the PWS include a section on ?transition period? and the required timeline that would be associated with the contract developing the transition plans.

GOVT:  It is understood that a contractor may need a transition period after award of this contract to stand up a core body of personnel and resources to prepare for and support efforts which will be placed on this contract.  This process should be reviewed and understood by the Government.  Transition of workload is not anticipated at this time; however any transition, if necessary, will be considered for discrete orders placed on this contract.  Additional recommendations are welcome and this topic can be discussed further during Industry Day, if desired.

8.   Recommend that the PWS include a section on ?Meetings? that includes all of the known planned meetings which will be required throughout the life of the contract.

GOVT:   Program Management Reviews are identified in para 2.2.4.2 of the PWS. Additional programmatic and technical reviews will be identified in individual task/delivery orders.  Additional meetings determined beneficial may also be recommended.

9.  Please provide a public list of contractors interested in partnering/team arrangements.

GOVT:  The A-10 Program Office does not maintain nor distribute lists of contractors. However, the Government will be conducting an Industry Day at the end of November to discuss the Prime follow-on effort. That venue may provide opportunities for those interested in partnering/teaming arrangements.


10.  The terms ?may? and ?may be? are used throughout the PWS. Specific guidance regarding how the USAF would like the contractor to interpret and estimate items where these terms are used is required.

GOVT:   Because this PWS is a broad scoping document, the terms ?may? and ?may be? are used to define the potential of having to perform a task or delivery effort.  In contrast words like ?will? and ?shall? articulate an expected requirement. Specific work will be defined in individual task/delivery orders. 

11. There are cases in the PWS where ?will? is used relative to contractor action or responsibility. It is our plan to interpret these as ?shall?.

GOVT;   We concur with your interpretation.

12.  Will contract clause ?9952.774-H774, Exclusive Subcontract Arrangements (Apr 05),? be used on this contract?

GOVT:  It is the Government?s intention to use this clause in the RFP.

13.  Section 2.2.1.1. Contractor recommends the Government insert SEMP for SEP throughout the PWS.

GOVT:  A recent USD (AT&L) memorandum established systems engineering policy and mandated a Systems Engineering Plan (SEP) for all programs. The use of the term SEMP is no longer used among DOD activities. However, a new CDRL for the SEP has not as of yet been developed. We will provide further guidance as it becomes available.
(See DOD Systems Engineering Preparation Guide, v2, October 2007)

14.  Section 2.2.4.9. Contractor recommends the Government delete ?A/OA-10 Aircraft Security Classification Guide, 31 March 2006? or current version.  

GOVT:  The current Security Classification Guide (SCG) is in force at this time.  A revised SCG is expected to be released later this year.

<NAICS>238990
<OFFADD>Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (DOE Contractor), Industrial Partnerships & Commercialization, 7000 East Avenue L-795, Livermore, CA, 94550, UNITED STATES
<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Desalinization and Water Filtration Using Carbon Nanotubes
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Desalinization and Water Filtration Using Carbon Nanotubes

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license, develop, and commercialize new technology using carbon nanotubes for desalinization and water filtration.    

Background:	The water supplies of the world face increasing stress because of increasing populations, pollution, and drought. There is a need for an efficient means of filtering and desalinizing water which does not use excessive amounts of energy and can provide highly effective filtration of both chemicals and biological organisms.

Description:  Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied fluid flow through microfabricated membranes which had aligned carbon nanotubes with pores with diameters of less than 2 nanometers. The researchers discovered that water flow rates exceeded classical models by three orders of magnitude.   These carbon nanotube membranes demonstrated permeabilities which are several orders of magnitude higher than conventional membranes, despite having pore sizes an order of magnitude smaller. This discovery initiated efforts to create a new technology providing energy-efficient nanoscale filtration using carbon nanotubes. The researchers published their findings in Science Magazine (19 May 2006, Vol. 312. no. 5776, pp. 1034 ? 1037) http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/312/5776/1034.pdf after filing a patent application covering the invention.

Advantages:  This new technology offers the following potential advantages over existing water filtration technology:  
?	Can filter out both chemicals and biological organisms (bacteria and viruses).
?	Lower energy consumption than reverse osmosis or distillation.
?	High flow rates compared to traditional membrane filters.
?	No chemicals used in the processing.
?	No harmful by-products produced from using the process.

Potential Applications:  The most immediate application of this invention relates to water purification and desalinization. However, the technology also has applications relating to other fluids, though these applications are less researched. For water purification and desalinization, this technology could apply to small scale personal applications (e.g. hikers, boaters, campers, military personnel, home use, etc.), or it could apply to large scale water supplies. 

Development Status:  LLNL researchers have prototyped the use of carbon nanotubes to filter low-salinity water. However, this work is still in the research phase. The researchers have a goal of creating a prototype which will desalinize water.

LLNL is seeking industry partners to help develop and commercialize this technology.   The ideal development partner would have some or all of the following qualifications:
?	Experience in a water related business.
?	Demonstrated ability to bring inventions to the market.
?	The patience to invest at least three years of development to bring this early stage technology to market.
?	The resources to make a significant investment in the development of this technology for commercialization (probably in the millions of dollars).
?	An interest in performing and funding cooperative research at LLNL.
?	Substantial manufacturing and research operations in the United States (mandatory requirement).

Intellectual Property:  LLNL has filed an International Patent Application covering this technology.

All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  For more information, please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php

This website also provides more information regarding LLNL?s industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's technology for desalinization and water filtration using carbon nanotubes should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology

Written responses should be directed to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The following provides the specifications:

The US Government is interested in assisting the Government of El Salvador through the acquisition and implementation of a national Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), to be used for law enforcement criminal identification purposes.  This AFIS will serve as El Salvador's national criminal fingerprint identification repository.  

El Salvador's criminal fingerprint program is managed by the Policia Nacional Civil (PNC) and has a card-based ten print database of over 250,000 records.  Part of this database has been converted to electronic format and is stored in an AFIS located at the PNC.  This AFIS is not fully functional, and the 65,000 records stored in it are searched by name only at this time.  Of the remaining card-based fingerprint records, approximately 75,000 records are filed by Henry classification and are manually searchable and approximately 110,000 records are pending comparison to existing records and are sorted and stored in batches by date of receipt. 

The fingerprint records that are submitted to El Salvador's national database are collected, classified and searched regionally throughout the country.  These records are then forwarded to the PNC.  New fingerprint records are currently being catalogued by date of PNC receipt and stored pending comparison, identification, and filing.  

The Contractor shall develop, install, and support AFIS technology in El Salvador for criminal justice purposes.  The Contractor shall propose a complete Project Plan.  The Contractor shall install an AFIS within the confines of the PNC, exact location to be determined by the PNC.  The Referenced AFIS must, at a minimum, meet the following specifications:

Database capacity:  One million ten print and/or latent records with expansion                                               capability 
Expected System Availability:  24 hours/day x 7 days/week x 52 weeks/year
System Accuracy Requirement:  99%  
Initial Daily Search Capacity:   Ten print = 5000 records
           Latent = 50 searches
Response Time Requirement:  Ten Prints = 2 minutes for ten print searches
     					           Latent =15 minutes
Supports digital images attached to the fingerprint record
Capable of generating EFTS v7.1 record files for export
Capable of automated "lights out" and user facilitated identifications
Provides for no less than ten "user defined" data fields

The Contractor shall provide and install five remote data entry/fingerprint query terminals located at the following PNC delegation offices: Soyapango Station, San Salvador Centro Station, San Miguel Station, Santa Ana Station, and the La Libertad Norte Station.  An additional two remote terminals will be installed at locations to be determined by the PNC.  These terminals shall support both live scan and card scan fingerprint acquisition.  The Contractor shall provide each terminal with both a live scan and card scan device that are FBI certified.  The remote data terminals shall be capable of completing ten print, palm print, and latent print searches of the AFIS database and receiving query responses from the AFIS.  Each remote terminal will require user authentication and will support an inactivity timeout capability.  A Universal Power Supply shall be provided for each work station and supporting peripheral grouping.  The contractor shall use the existing PNC telecommunications network to connect the remote terminals to the central AFIS, using PNC-provided extended network connections.  The contractor shall provide a per unit price for optional provision of similarly equipped, additional 26 remote terminals. 

The Contractor shall facilitate the conversion of no less than 10,000 card-based records (to be provided by the PNC) to electronic records installed in the proposed AFIS.  In addition, the Contractor shall re-host the electronic records contained in the AFIX Tracker AFIS located at the PNC to the new AFIS.

The contractor shall insure that fingerprint records entered into the AFIS, or fingerprint records residing in the AFIS and selected by the PNC, can be routed, either simultaneous to entry or independently by administrator command, to an exportable file capable of being copied to a portable media such as a DVD, tape drive or USB drive. 

The Contractor shall develop and install the AFIS in such a manner that it will be easily networked and fully compatible with external AFIS databases, each using the EFTS v7.1 specification. 

The Contractor shall develop and provide a formal written Test Plan to the designated Project Managers that evaluates all AFIS functions using data sets derived from El Salvador's existing fingerprint records.  The Contractor shall implement the Test Plan prior to the initiation of system training.

All training will include live, practical, hands-on exercises in addition to classroom or simulated training.    

The Contractor shall provide a new-user training manual for use by the PNC in ongoing, post-delivery training.  All training, to include training materials, shall be provided in Spanish and English.  Training Courses:  New record entry and search, Record conversion, Remote data entry, System and Database Operation and Administration,
AFIS record archiving and exporting

The Contractor shall provide written documentation for the AFIS design, operation, administration, and maintenance.  All documentation shall be provided in English and Spanish. 

The AFIS shall be capable of generating logical statistical reports on, at a minimum, system usage by transaction type, system capacity, system administration, system utilities, biographic data field parameters, and user logon and performance.

The Contractor shall price four option year periods subsequent to delivery and acceptance of the AFIS, for technical and operational support to the PNC regarding the use and operation of the AFIS.  This support can be augmented by any manufacturer warranty that applies to the hardware and software used in the project, but remains the primary responsibility of the Contractor for the duration of the option O&M periods.  The support program shall include all updates to the AFIS operating system, proprietary source code, AFIS search algorithms,  and all applicable hardware and software service patches.

The proposed main AFIS will be located at the Policia Nacional Civil (PNC) in San Salvador, El Salvador.
