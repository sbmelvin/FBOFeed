During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publically disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publically for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be publically disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</p>

<p>1. CHAMELEON SYSTEM: XR: 90MHz, Serial Number: GDP.1068731.8912</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Cytogenetic and Microscopy Core mission is to provide NHGRI investigators access to imaging and cytogenetics resources that support and extend their abilities to discover the causes of disease and the mechanisms of normal development and physiology.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance (Base with two Options):</span></strong></p>
<p>Base: November 19, 2013 through November 18, 2014<br />Option Period 1: November 19, 2014 November 18, 2015<br />Option Period 2: November 19, 2015 through November 18, 2016</p>

<DESC><br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) No. HHS-NIH-NIDA (MH)-14-272 to re-compete a requirement currently being performed under NIMH Contract <br />HHSN271200900018C&nbsp;entitled, "NIMH Toxicological Evaluation of Novel Ligands Program". This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS Code 541712. It is anticipated that a single Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract, with both cost reimbursement and fixed price, severable and non-severable task orders will be awarded for a five (5) year period of performance beginning on or about May 26, 2014.
<p>The purpose of this solicitation is to re-compete for contract services to support the NIMH Toxicological Evaluation of Novel Ligands Program. The contact services include the assessment of the toxicology and safety of promising, target-selective compounds for use in human studies. It is anticipated that NIMH-approved and coded samples will be submitted from a variety of sources including NIH-funded research programs, pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, or other sources. Toxicology and safety data generated from this program will be used by investigators in support of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application or for Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC) evaluation of the compound for human studies. In cases where the compound shows toxicity at doses within the range anticipated for human use, the data will provide investigators with valuable information upon which to base further development of structural analogs.</p>
<p>Toxicology studies that will be conducted under this contract may include the following major objectives:</p>
<p>-Determination of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)<br />-Determination of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT)<br />-Determination of schedule-dependent toxicity<br />-Determination of the reversibility of adverse effects<br />-Determination of a safe clinical starting dose</p>
<p>In addition to these objectives, studies may also be designed to make the following determinations:</p>
<p>-Whether the efficacious drug levels can be attained in plasma in vivo<br />-Whether an agent crosses the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>This is a pre-solicitation notice in advance of the Request for Proposal (RFP), and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The RFP, detailing the specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an offeror's proposal will be available electronically on or about November 7, 2013 and may be accessed through the Internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>W911QY-14-S-CDP1 <br> MCS-CDP REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br> Nerve agent antidotes in an autoinjector <br>  <br> SYNOPSIS: <br>  <br> The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to conduct market research for manufacturing capability for the nerve agent antidotes atropine and 2-pralidoxime, in a single autoinjector for intramuscular administration by military Service Members. <br>  <br> Respondents are invited to provide materials related to their capabilities to fulfill ALL or ANY of the requirements listed below. Respondents should provide whether their level of interest and current capability is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm. If candidates are interested in teaming with other sources, please include in your response authorization to release your company's name, area of interest, and POC information to be made available on a public website. All proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security classification markings. <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This is not a solicitation for proposals. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: <br>  <br> Therapeutic pharmaceuticals against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents are required to support the Joint Forces across a range of military operations. As such, the Department of Defense (DoD) has a need for developing and fielding systems that provide treatment for exposure to CBRN agents. The Medical Countermeasure Systems - Chemical Defense Pharmaceuticals (MCS-CDP) Joint Product Management Office is responsible for the development, procurement, fielding, and sustaining of medical treatment and prophylactic capabilities against chemical, radiological and nuclear threats. The current MCS-CDP portfolio includes nerve agent therapeutics, pretreatments and prophylactics at varying stages of clinical development, including FDA-approved drugs. The DoD currently procures the nerve agent antidotes atropine and 2-pralidoxime as components of the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Autoinjector (ATNAA), the replacement for the two injector MARK-1 nerve agent antidote kits. Each ATNAA autOinjector contains 2.1 mg atropine in 0. 7 mL solution and 600 mg pralidoxime chloride in 2 mL solution in separate chambers as sterile, pyrogen free solutions for intramuscular injection, sequentially, through a single needle. The ATNAA is a self-contained unit designed for self- or buddy-administration by military personnel. The National Stock Number for the ATNAA product is NSN 6505-01-362-7427. ATNAAs are supplied through the Directorate of Medical Materiel, Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support. The U.S. Army Office of The Surgeon General (OTSG) sponsors the ATNAA New Drug Application (NDA), NDA 21-175, approved in January 2002.  <br>  <br>  <br> OBJECTIVE: <br>  <br> Currently, MCS-CDP is seeking capabilities from potential sources for development of an autoinjector drug-delivery device that will simultaneously or sequentially deliver the nerve agent antidotes atropine and 2-PAM. These life-saving antidotes are used in conjunction with the pretreatment, pyridostigmine bromide (PB), and an anticonvulsant. <br>  <br> System requirements include a drug delivery platform containing the drugs atropine and 2-PAM. The delivery device platform and antidotes must be stable at operationally relevant temperatures to include temperature extremes experienced by Service Members in the field. The storage conditions must be equal to conditions indicated for the ATNAA (i.e., stored at 25  C (77  F), excursions permitted to 15-30  C (50-86  F), [Keep from Freezing, Protect from light]), or be such as to provide reduced logistical burden. In addition, the shelf life should eventually be comparable to that obtained for the ATNAA (i.e., 5 years at controlled room temperature). The Service Member-carried device must be administrable by self- and buddy-aid in Mission Oriented Protective Posture 4 (MOPP-4) over-garments and mask, to a casualty in MOPP-4. <br>  <br> As such, MCS-CDP is seeking information on current industry capabilities from interested entities in the following areas: <br>  <br> (1) Description of company's proposed drug delivery platform, to include: <br>  <br> - General background information, product name and description, as well as pertinent development efforts needed to encompass delivery of atropine and 2-PAM in a single autoinjector that accounts for bioavailability interactions between the two drugs. <br> - Appropriateness of proposed drug delivery device  for military field-use, including: <br> a. Portability of the proposed drug delivery platform by the Warfighter and combat medic      <br> b. Ease of self- or buddy administration by personnel in Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 4 protective ensemble  <br> c. Ability of the proposed drug delivery platform to administer drug product through MOPP-4 <br> d. Suitability for use across a wide range of temperature and operationally relevant environmental conditions  <br> e. Suitability for long term storage at controlled room temperature <br> f. Compatibility of known pharmaceutical products in the proposed drug delivery platform, as well as its components, under long-term storage conditions    <br> - Summary of existing manufacturing capabilities, annual and surge capacity, and place of manufacture.   <br> - Any intellectual property concerns to include your company's rights and ability to sell or license any intellectual property as well as your company's interest in selling or licensing the intellectual property. Proprietary information should be marked as described in the paragraph below. <br>  <br> (2) Description of company's experience with FDA regulatory activities leading to product approval/licensure, to include:   <br> a. Ability to manage activities related to the development of an IND application and New Drug Application (NDA) submissions and supplements. Describe experience with submissions in an electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format. <br> b. Engaging in meetings with the FDA and preparation of pre-meeting information packets. <br> c. Comparative bioavailability and bioequivalence studies <br> d. Stability testing at controlled room temperature and identification of temperature excursion limits <br>  <br> (3) Submit  quote mark Draft Development Plan Outline quote mark  describing, proposed preclinical, clinical studies, and CDRH device studies/protocols. <br>  <br> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: <br>  <br> All written responses must be received within fifteen (15) days of issuance of this RFI.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>BACKGROUND <br />Multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) have been defined by the Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) in a strategic framework (2010 available online at http://www.hhs.gov/ash/initiatives/mcc/mcc_framework.pdf) as two or more conditions that last a year or more and require ongoing medical attention and/or limit activities of daily living. Approximately 67% of Americans age 65 and older living with MCCs need complex health care services which generate high health care costs. Moreover, their medical care is often fragmented, incomplete, inefficient, ineffective and consequently of poor quality.</p>
<p>Improving the quality of health care for people with MCCs requires a multipart effort, one of which rests on developing performance measures reflecting their heterogeneity and outcomes important to them. Since many existing performance measures are disease-specific, new measures must be refined and developed to address the complexity of care for those living with MCCs. New measures may be evaluated by the National Quality Forum (NQF), a nonprofit membership organization created to develop and implement a national strategy for healthcare quality measurement and reporting, using consensus process to endorse national priorities and goals for performance improvement. In 2012, NQF endorsed a measurement framework for MCCs, and that forms a conceptual background for this solicitation (available online at http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2012/05/MCC_Measurement_Framework_Final_Report.aspx). Within that framework, this project relates to the Health and Well-Being domain, Treatment and Management type of care, Primary and Specialty Care (outpatient), and the patient and family goals and preferences for care.</p>
<p>Many workgroups have expressed interest in patient reported outcome (PRO) measures to examine the health of persons with MCCs, from the NIH-developed Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and other sources. The PROMIS-29 instrument has been published in Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, December 2012 (doi: 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04240.x.). The Medical Outcomes Study, Short-Form 36 (SF-36) is available online from<br />http://www.qualitymetric.com/WhatWeDo/SFHealthSurveys/tabid/184/Default.aspx. <br />The Veterans Rand 12-item Health Survey (VR-12) has been widely used both inside and outside Department of Veterans Affairs and has shown to have similar properties to SF-36 and has no intellectual property issues. However, additional analysis is necessary to test the validity of the PROMIS tools and VR-12 in an older adult population with multiple chronic conditions. More recently, NQF released a report on how to develop, test, endorse and implement patient-reported outcome performance measures (available online at http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2012/12/Patient-Reported_Outcomes_in_Performance_Measurement.aspx). The NQF report describes the distinction between a PRO and a PRO based performance measure and lays out a pathway to move from PROs to NQF-endorsed PRO based performance measure. The latter is an aggregate measure of performance by a practitioner or in an entity considered accountable for the quality of care delivered.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />The objective of this contract is to develop routine measurements of health outcomes for older adults living in the community with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs), through validated patient-reported outcome measures of health, functional status and quality of life and to conduct research and prepare materials suitable for quality measure endorsement by the National Quality Forum (NQF).</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS/Scope of Work<br />This project consists of two phases, each of which should produce a complete report suitable for submission to the National Quality Forum (NQF) for endorsement of a performance measure on health related quality of life for persons living with MCCs. The reports should address NQF's Measurement Evaluation Criteria for the proposed performance measure. The report should address the criteria that are current as of the initiation of work, include the importance, scientific acceptability, feasibility, and usability of the study (at present they are dated November 2012 and are available online at http://www.qualityforum.org/docs/measure_evaluation_criteria.aspx). If the NQF adopts its proposed two-stage consensus development process, the report should be separated to address each stage. Phase 1 addresses VR-12 while Phase 2 addresses PROMIS-29, although a strongly justified alternate proposal for a different measure for Phase 1 may be considered acceptable.</p>
<p>A. Phase 1<br />Phase 1 involves the analysis of existing data on health-related quality of life on persons with MCCs. The offeror shall propose a PRO-based performance measure, with a preference for the Veterans Rand 12-item Health Survey (VR-12), SF-36 or SF-12, and perform the following;</p>
<p>I. Aggregate the PRO measure by using average change; percentage improved or meeting a benchmark. Present a strong justification for the choice and indicate why it is superior to potential alternative measures.</p>
<p>II. Refine the performance measure and conduct analyses in a sample of MCC patients from available data against the NQF criteria, for reliability, validity, and threats to validity. The analysis of threats to validity should measure exclusions; missing data or poor response rate; case mix differences and risk adjustment; discrimination of performance.</p>
<p>III. Offeror will analyze the quality of care provided to older adults with MCCs, by conducting secondary data analysis of existing data with a measure of health related quality of life to:</p>
<p>&bull; Identify where there are disparities in health outcomes (readmissions, change in patient-reported physical health, and/or mental health) for older adults with MCC.<br />&bull; Quantify the magnitude and variation in disparities in health outcomes.<br />&bull; Demonstrate the feasibility of reporting health outcome measures stratified by the presence of MCCs.</p>
<p>Source of Data for Phase 1: For this phase, offerors should specify and justify their proposed source of data which is suitable for conducting the required analyses, and assure its availability. Offerors should provide sample size, disease ascertainment, outcome measures and a power calculation for three main analyses. Potential sources of data for this phase include but are not limited to 1) the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (http://www.hosonline.org/Content/Default.aspx) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2) Health ABC (http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/ledb/healthabc/index.htm) available from the National Institute on Aging; 3) linkage of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) with the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) known as SEER-MHOS and available from the National Cancer Institute; 4) Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) which is co-sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).<br /><br />Currently, as part of the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey, Medicare Advantage (managed care) plans collect information on limited health outcome measures in older adults, including:<br />I. Proportion of patients with improved or maintained physical health over two years based on patient self-report to the Veterans Rand 12-item Health Survey<br />II. Proportion of patients with improved or maintained mental health over two years based on patient self-report to the Veterans Rand 12-item Health Survey</p>
<p>These measures are reported to the public in aggregate and used by Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS) to provide Medicare Advantage Organizations with quality bonus payments based on their performance compared to a benchmark. Currently these measures are reported for all adults age 65+ enrolled in Medicare Advantage health plans, a self-selected group of Medicare beneficiaries. Because the report covers a general older adult population, it is not known if disparities exist, and to what degree, in the quality of care provided specifically for older adults with MCC as measured by these outcomes. It is also unclear if there is variation in the magnitude of the disparity across health providers.</p>
<p>B. Phase 2<br />Phase 2 involves the collection and analysis of data using the PROMIS-29 profile and other instruments from a sample of persons age 65 and over with MCCs. Many short forms developed by the PROMIS group for self-administration to patients have been tested for reliability, face validity (through focus groups, expert panels, cognitive interviewing), construct validity (convergent and discriminate validity) and differential item functioning testing. The PROMIS tools, in particular the PROMIS-29 Profile measure, have not been extensively tested in an adult population age 65 and over. Testing of the PROMIS measures was done via the internet with a primarily healthy adult population. The sample size of older adults, particularly the very old (over age 80 years), was limited. Additional research and analysis is necessary to test the validity of the PROMIS tools in an older adult population with multiple chronic conditions and advance toward a potential quality measure for outpatient care. <br />Specifically, the Contractor shall:<br />I. Prepare a survey instrument containing disease ascertainment questions, PROMIS-29 Profile, VR-12 and SF-36. <br />II. Estimate sample size necessary for the proposed analyses, using a cross-sectional design. <br />III. Obtain required human subjects review and approval and prepare a package for NIH clinical exemption from OMB review.<br />IV. Conduct the survey in the field via different modes of administration (mail, telephone, and internet). Prepare and clean the data for analysis. <br />V. Analyze the data on: <br />&bull; The feasibility of using PROMIS-29 with different modes of administration (mail, telephone, internet)<br />&bull; The construct validity of these survey tools in this population, including convergent and discriminate validity with other measures of physical and mental health<br />&bull; Floor/ceiling effects in the survey measures in this complex population<br />&bull; Differential item functioning<br />&bull; Sensitivity to known group differences in health (e.g. differences based on number of chronic conditions, hospitalization, HCC risk category scores).<br />VI. Refine the performance measure and conduct analyses against the NQF criteria, for reliability, validity, and threats to validity. The analysis of threats to validity should measure exclusions; missing data or poor response rate; case mix differences and risk adjustment; discrimination of performance. <br />REPORTS/DELIVERABLES<br />The following deliverables should be provided to the NIA Contracting Officers Representative (COR) according to the schedule agreed upon at the time of award. Electronic files should use Microsoft Word, or SAS transport, as appropriate. NQF criteria for measure endorsement in effect on September 1, 2014 should be addressed in the deliverables.</p>
<p>&bull; Monthly calls with the NIA COR regarding progress<br />&bull; Human subjects approval, waiver or exemption, prior to undertaking any data analysis or human subject research, but no later than 3 months after start of the contract.<br />&bull; Report describing Phase 2, suitable for consideration of the clinical exemption under the Paperwork Reduction Act by the NIH clinical exemption review committee, 3 months after start of the contract.<br />&bull; Phase 1: The materials and analyses necessary to submit a MCC-specific version of the VR-12 based outcome measures for National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsement.<br />o Draft report 9 months after contract starts<br />o Final Report 12 months after contract starts <br />&bull; Phase 2: The materials and analyses necessary to develop a new PROMIS-based health outcome measure in older adults with MCC for NQF endorsement. <br />o Draft Report 18 months after contract starts<br />o Final Report 21 months after contract starts<br />&bull; A complete report of the analysis suitable for presentation and publication in peer-reviewed literature. 23 months after contract starts<br />&bull; A complete cleaned data set with adequate documentation of all elements, and programming code used to produce analyses in Final Reports and manuscript(s), delivered with the Final Report.<br />&bull; Semi-annual reports, every 6 months, no later than 30 days after the end of the reporting period.<br />&bull; Final Report, on or before completion of the contract.</p>

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.
<p>BACKGROUND <br />Multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) have been defined by the Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) in a strategic framework (2010 available online at http://www.hhs.gov/ash/initiatives/mcc/mcc_framework.pdf) as two or more conditions that last a year or more and require ongoing medical attention and/or limit activities of daily living. Approximately 67% of Americans age 65 and older living with MCCs need complex health care services which generate high health care costs. Moreover, their medical care is often fragmented, incomplete, inefficient, ineffective and consequently of poor quality.</p>
<p>Improving the quality of health care for people with MCCs requires a multipart effort, one of which rests on developing performance measures reflecting their heterogeneity and outcomes important to them. Since many existing performance measures are disease-specific, new measures must be refined and developed to address the complexity of care for those living with MCCs. New measures may be evaluated by the National Quality Forum (NQF), a nonprofit membership organization created to develop and implement a national strategy for healthcare quality measurement and reporting, using consensus process to endorse national priorities and goals for performance improvement. In 2012, NQF endorsed a measurement framework for MCCs, and that forms a conceptual background for this solicitation (available online at http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2012/05/MCC_Measurement_Framework_Final_Report.aspx). Within that framework, this project relates to the Health and Well-Being domain, Treatment and Management type of care, Primary and Specialty Care (outpatient), and the patient and family goals and preferences for care.</p>
<p>Many workgroups have expressed interest in patient reported outcome (PRO) measures to examine the health of persons with MCCs, from the NIH-developed Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and other sources. The PROMIS-29 instrument has been published in Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, December 2012 (doi: 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04240.x.). The Medical Outcomes Study, Short-Form 36 (SF-36) is available online from<br />http://www.qualitymetric.com/WhatWeDo/SFHealthSurveys/tabid/184/Default.aspx. <br />The Veterans Rand 12-item Health Survey (VR-12) has been widely used both inside and outside Department of Veterans Affairs and has shown to have similar properties to SF-36 and has no intellectual property issues. However, additional analysis is necessary to test the validity of the PROMIS tools and VR-12 in an older adult population with multiple chronic conditions. More recently, NQF released a report on how to develop, test, endorse and implement patient-reported outcome performance measures (available online at http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2012/12/Patient-Reported_Outcomes_in_Performance_Measurement.aspx). The NQF report describes the distinction between a PRO and a PRO based performance measure and lays out a pathway to move from PROs to NQF-endorsed PRO based performance measure. The latter is an aggregate measure of performance by a practitioner or in an entity considered accountable for the quality of care delivered.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />The objective of this contract is to develop routine measurements of health outcomes for older adults living in the community with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs), through validated patient-reported outcome measures of health, functional status and quality of life and to conduct research and prepare materials suitable for quality measure endorsement by the National Quality Forum (NQF).</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS/Scope of Work<br />This project consists of two phases, each of which should produce a complete report suitable for submission to the National Quality Forum (NQF) for endorsement of a performance measure on health related quality of life for persons living with MCCs. The reports should address NQF's Measurement Evaluation Criteria for the proposed performance measure. The report should address the criteria that are current as of the initiation of work, include the importance, scientific acceptability, feasibility, and usability of the study (at present they are dated November 2012 and are available online at http://www.qualityforum.org/docs/measure_evaluation_criteria.aspx). If the NQF adopts its proposed two-stage consensus development process, the report should be separated to address each stage. Phase 1 addresses VR-12 while Phase 2 addresses PROMIS-29, although a strongly justified alternate proposal for a different measure for Phase 1 may be considered acceptable.</p>
<p>A. Phase 1<br />Phase 1 involves the analysis of existing data on health-related quality of life on persons with MCCs. The offeror shall propose a PRO-based performance measure, with a preference for the Veterans Rand 12-item Health Survey (VR-12), SF-36 or SF-12, and perform the following;</p>
<p>I. Aggregate the PRO measure by using average change; percentage improved or meeting a benchmark. Present a strong justification for the choice and indicate why it is superior to potential alternative measures.</p>
<p>II. Refine the performance measure and conduct analyses in a sample of MCC patients from available data against the NQF criteria, for reliability, validity, and threats to validity. The analysis of threats to validity should measure exclusions; missing data or poor response rate; case mix differences and risk adjustment; discrimination of performance.</p>
<p>III. Offeror will analyze the quality of care provided to older adults with MCCs, by conducting secondary data analysis of existing data with a measure of health related quality of life to:</p>
<p>&bull; Identify where there are disparities in health outcomes (readmissions, change in patient-reported physical health, and/or mental health) for older adults with MCC.<br />&bull; Quantify the magnitude and variation in disparities in health outcomes.<br />&bull; Demonstrate the feasibility of reporting health outcome measures stratified by the presence of MCCs.</p>
<p>Source of Data for Phase 1: For this phase, offerors should specify and justify their proposed source of data which is suitable for conducting the required analyses, and assure its availability. Offerors should provide sample size, disease ascertainment, outcome measures and a power calculation for three main analyses. Potential sources of data for this phase include but are not limited to 1) the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (http://www.hosonline.org/Content/Default.aspx) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2) Health ABC (http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/ledb/healthabc/index.htm) available from the National Institute on Aging; 3) linkage of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) with the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) known as SEER-MHOS and available from the National Cancer Institute; 4) Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) which is co-sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).<br /><br />Currently, as part of the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey, Medicare Advantage (managed care) plans collect information on limited health outcome measures in older adults, including:<br />I. Proportion of patients with improved or maintained physical health over two years based on patient self-report to the Veterans Rand 12-item Health Survey<br />II. Proportion of patients with improved or maintained mental health over two years based on patient self-report to the Veterans Rand 12-item Health Survey</p>
<p>These measures are reported to the public in aggregate and used by Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS) to provide Medicare Advantage Organizations with quality bonus payments based on their performance compared to a benchmark. Currently these measures are reported for all adults age 65+ enrolled in Medicare Advantage health plans, a self-selected group of Medicare beneficiaries. Because the report covers a general older adult population, it is not known if disparities exist, and to what degree, in the quality of care provided specifically for older adults with MCC as measured by these outcomes. It is also unclear if there is variation in the magnitude of the disparity across health providers.</p>
<p>B. Phase 2<br />Phase 2 involves the collection and analysis of data using the PROMIS-29 profile and other instruments from a sample of persons age 65 and over with MCCs.

Estimate sample size necessary for the proposed analyses, using a cross-sectional design. <br />III. Obtain required human subjects review and approval and prepare a package for NIH clinical exemption from OMB review.<br />IV. Conduct the survey in the field via different modes of administration (mail, telephone, and internet). Prepare and clean the data for analysis. <br />V. Analyze the data on: <br />&bull; The feasibility of using PROMIS-29 with different modes of administration (mail, telephone, internet)<br />&bull; The construct validity of these survey tools in this population, including convergent and discriminate validity with other measures of physical and mental health<br />&bull; Floor/ceiling effects in the survey measures in this complex population<br />&bull; Differential item functioning<br />&bull; Sensitivity to known group differences in health (e.g. differences based on number of chronic conditions, hospitalization, HCC risk category scores).<br />VI. Refine the performance measure and conduct analyses against the NQF criteria, for reliability, validity, and threats to validity. The analysis of threats to validity should measure exclusions; missing data or poor response rate; case mix differences and risk adjustment; discrimination of performance. <br />REPORTS/DELIVERABLES<br />The following deliverables should be provided to the NIA Contracting Officers Representative (COR) according to the schedule agreed upon at the time of award.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC. <br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Institute was authorized in 1974 (PL 93-296) to improve the health and well-being of older Americans through research. Specifically, NIA supports and conducts research on aging processes, aging-related diseases, and the special problems and needs of older people; trains highly skilled research scientists; develops and maintains state-of-the art resources to accelerate research progress; and communicates with the public about health and research advances. Subsequent amendments to this legislation designated NIA as the primary Federal agency on Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. In January 2011, President Obama signed the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA), which called for an aggressive and coordinated national Alzheimer's disease plan, which was unveiled in May 2012. <br /><br />The NIA Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) plans and carries out a legislatively mandated education program to disseminate the research findings of the Institute and all other relevant information to help older Americans deal with the problems of, and understand the processes associated with, aging. To assist in this outreach and communication effort, the NIA funds two national information centers: the National Institute on Aging Information Center (NIAIC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center, initiated in response to a 1986 Congressional mandate to "gather, maintain, and disseminate information about AD and publish an annual summary of the latest information" (P.L. 99 660, Part F, Section 951). In addition, the ADEAR Center's activities contribute to the implementation of the National Plan instituted by NAPA. Together, these two centers form the NIA Information Resource Center. The need for the Centers has not diminished since their inception. In fact, as the American population ages, the need for research-based information on aging and AD is ever more urgent.<br />In dealing with the public and other Information Center users, each of these two national information centers has a separate and unique identity. The NIAIC disseminates aging-related health education and disease prevention information, and the ADEAR Center serves as a national resource on AD, providing accurate, timely, research-based information about the disease, its consequences and potential treatments, research, and available services. Each Information Center serves a broad audience of the general public, patients and family members, physicians and other health professionals, researchers, special interest groups, service organizations, other government agencies, and the mass media.<br /><br />This is not a new requirement. A similar requirement entitled The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Information Resource Center is currently awarded to JBS International, Inc. <br /><br />OBJECTIVES<br /><br />The primary objective of the project is to provide all management, technical, logistical, and administrative services, including, facilities for the continued operation of the NIA Information Resource Center, which includes the NIA Information Center (NIAIC) and the congressionally mandated Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center. <br /><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS/SCOPE OF WORK<br /><br />NIA is seeking information from all Small Business sources capable of providing NIA with an information support system. The contract will be designed to ensure that the vitally needed information associated with aging is disseminated to the members of the general public and to the health care professionals responsible for their care. The potential interested Small Business must demonstrate experience and capability to perform in the following fourteen (14) areas:<br /><br />1) The Contractor must demonstrate the ability to provide all management, technical, logistical, and administrative services for the operation of the NIA Information Resource Center.

The Government ownership currently starts at the secondary of the DVP transformer and as defined by the Right of Access.  There are three primary circuit feeders on JBLE-Langley AFB: a 34.5 kilovolt (kV) loop feeder owned by Dominion Virginia Power (DVP), multiple 22 kV loop circuits owned by the government (fed from the 34.5 kV loop) and 5 kV circuits owned by the government (fed from multiple 22kV - 5kV substations).  The electric system in the housing areas are owned and operated by Barksdale Langley Bolling Family Housing (BLBFH).   The utility system is composed of, without limitation, switchgear, overhead and underground conductors, utility poles, ducts, manholes, pad-mount and pole-mount transformers, meters, instrumentation, street lighting fixtures, and other ancillary fixed equipment related to electricity delivered to end users on the Installation.</p>
<p>Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are:  all meters, airfield lighting, parking lot lights serviced by secondary feed from a building, emergency generators that exist for the purpose of emergency back-up for AF facilities, geographically separated units (GSU), Dominion Virginia Power (DVP) owned 34.5 kV primary loop and laterals directly servicing facilities located on JBLE-Langley behind DVP's JBLE-Langley master metering, facilities fed directly from DVP off-Base grid and BLBFH privatized housing.</p>
<p>Dominion Virginia Power Company provides power to the Dominion Virginia Power Company owned substation.</p>

<p>The Postal Service is issuing a request for quote (RFQ) as a sources sought notice. This is an invitation for potential suppliers to submit price quotes for providing air transportation, ground handling and deicing services for the peak offshore operation. The dedicated offshore operation will provide point-to-point air transportation service, defined as round trip transportation on December 18, 2013 through December 22, 2013 with optional days on December 23 and 24, 2013 between Memphis, Tennessee (MEM), and the following destinations: Anchorage, Alaska (ANC), Honolulu, Hawaii (HNL), and San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU), according to the schedules. Attachment 1, Service Schedules, of the resultant contract will contain the finalized schedules for these flights.</p>
<p>This does not imply a commitment to acquire the services from any responding supplier. An RFQ provides the Postal Service with useful information to further assess innovative solutions and a better understanding of how the requirement can best be met.</p>
<p>Your quote for the service should be submitted using the attached Pricing Matrix Template by no later than Friday, October 25, 2013 5:00pm EST. Please submit your quotes via email to:</p>
<p>Erika Ramirez<br />Purchasing and Supply Management Specialist<br />Erika.v.ramirez@usps.gov<br />202-268-5846</p>
<p>PART 1 STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>1.1 Scope of Service</p>
<p>The supplier will provide Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance (ACMI), ground handling, deicing and related support services, including customer support and provisions for recovery.</p>
<p>The Postal Service or its agent will provide terminal handling support services of mail unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>The Postal Service will provide fuel necessary to complete contracted routes. Payment reconciliation for fuel usage will occur after the period of performance is completed.</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />The period of Performance will be from December 18 through December 22, 2013 with optional days on December 23 and 24, 2013.</p>
<p>Aircraft<br />Based on the projected demand, the Postal Service requires a total of two 747 freighter aircraft or two aircraft that can transport 130,000 pounds each.</p>
<p>The contracted aircraft will operate as fully dedicated aircraft during the date and hours of operation as specified within the Service Schedule(s) (Attachment 1). The aircraft must be available for loading and unloading per the times stated within the Service Schedule(s).</p>
<p>The type, quantity, and tail number of the aircraft will remain fixed for the entire term of the contract, unless a change or modification is approved by the contracting officer. The proposed dedicated aircraft for this operation will be required to carry mail up to the limit of the aircraft's lift capacity. The supplier must be able to transport all classes and types of mail up to the maximum published weight limit.</p>
<p>The supplier must maintain all aircraft in compliance with Federal Aviation Regulations as applicable to the type of certificate for aircraft provided, (for example, Part 121, subpart L) as applicable, and all other applicable U.S. Government regulations. The supplier is completely and exclusively responsible for the safety and maintenance (and all applicable maintenance costs) of aircraft.</p>
<p>The supplier must provide fully trained and qualified flight crews who are certified under FAR 121 regulations to operate all flights.</p>
<p>The supplier must comply with all Federal and local noise abatement restrictions at airports served, including alternate landing sites.</p>
<p>The supplier will acquire all landing slots and pay all parking and landing fees at each air stop and the alternate landing sites used in the performance of duties under this contract.</p>
<p>The supplier shall maintain operating capability at one alternate landing site for each airport.</p>
<p>Replacement Aircraft<br />The supplier must have the availability of one replacement aircraft capable of transporting 130,000 pounds per trip and crew to recover the service within 6 (six) hours of the scheduled departure time of the grounded aircraft. For example, if the aircraft is scheduled to depart at 1700 and becomes inoperable, then a replacement aircraft should be in place by 2300. In addition, the supplier will be required to work an agreed upon schedule to ensure all trips are returned to original service schedules within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Fuel <br />The Postal Service has implemented a fuel purchase program and intends to purchase aviation fuel for aircraft operated under the provisions of this contract. The supplier is required to obtain fuel from the designated source available at each location as specified.</p>
<p>If, for any reason, the Postal Service is unable to obtain fuel, the supplier will be responsible for obtaining and uploading all aviation fuel necessary to operate the aircraft. Upon notification, the supplier will become responsible for any and all costs associated with aviation fuel and its upload into the aircraft. In the event of this change in requirements, the Postal Service and the supplier will re-negotiate the terms and conditions of the contract to provide for reimbursement of fuel costs.</p>
<p>Deicing<br />The supplier will provide deicing services at the ANC and MEM air stops (as applicable.)</p>
<p>1.2 Delivery</p>
<p>1. The air transportation supplier will make mail available for unloading by the supplier's designated agent or the Postal Service, from the aircraft by opening aircraft cargo doors. For purposes of performance measurement, delivery will be defined through the following events:</p>
<p>&bull; Aircraft Arrival: defined by the "block in" time <br />&bull; Available for Unload: defined by the time the cargo door is opened and the aircraft is available to the ground handler personnel to safely enter aircraft<br />&bull; Unload Complete: defined by the time the last container or piece of mail is removed from aircraft<br />&bull; Mail Delivered: defined by the time the final piece or unit of mail is presented to the designated delivery point as specified in this document or Service Schedule. <br />&bull; All mail must be delivered at or before the scheduled delivery time. The air transportation supplier must not impede the ground handling operations.</p>
<p>2. The Postal Service expects the supplier to provide a high level of on-time performance so that the Postal Service can provide timely delivery of mail to its customers. The supplier's daily operational performance will be considered in determining service reliability and for purposes of renewal and future contract awards.</p>
<p><br />1.3 Division of Operational Responsibilities</p>
<p>Air Transportation Supplier:<br />The air transportation supplier must cooperate and work collaboratively with the Postal Service or its agents and, where appropriate, the terminal handling suppliers to ensure optimal performance throughout the entire operation. Functional responsibilities will be divided as follows:</p>
<p>The air transportation supplier must:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide aircraft for air transportation line haul service <br />&bull; Operate aircraft in order to transport mail between air stops specified in this document and Attachments<br />&bull; Schedule fueling with plane agent<br />&bull; Provide deicing services in ANC and MEM (as applicable)<br />&bull; Provide ground handling services in ANC, HNL, MEM, and SJU (as applicable); and will be responsible for other aspects of ramp operations, including:</p>

<p>&bull; Provide drayage service from HNL airport to:<br />HNL P&amp;DC Air Cargo Unit <br />3600 Aolele St<br />Honolulu, HI 96820</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare flight plans, and provide other support services necessary for the safe and efficient operation of the aircraft<br />&bull; Open cargo doors of aircraft and permit containers to be loaded onto the aircraft main deck, and mailbags and parcels (i.e., loose load mail) to be loaded into the lower cargo compartments of the aircraft<br />&bull; Provide adequate staffing to operate aircraft, and manage its flight operation <br />&bull; Provide adequate crew in order to prevent flights from being delayed due to lack of crew hours <br />&bull; Assign an individual fully dedicated to the Postal Service as a contact person<br />&bull; Notify ground handling supplier's load planner of the aircraft registration number and total payload available for the aircraft assigned to each route<br />&bull; Approve the completed load plan prepared for each aircraft by the ground-handling supplier<br />&bull; Provide a Loadmaster support for each aircraft provided <br />&bull; Communicate via the CORE system each time an event causes an impact of 15 minutes or more to the flight schedule. The supplier must input the data into the CORE system immediately after becoming aware of the event. In addition, for flights involving a Memphis, TN, arrival or departure, the supplier must notify the local Memphis, TN, Postal representative. Contact information will be provided upon contract award<br />&bull; Inform the ground-handling supplier of any and all aircraft schedule changes or delays which could affect incoming and outgoing traffic, including, but not limited to, maintenance, repair, and de-icing requirements</p>
<p>The Postal Service will not be responsible for providing crew lounge or lavatory services at any air stop.</p>
<p>Special Note - Ground Handling and Deicing:<br />If the air transportation supplier's de-icing and ground handling services proposal is not deemed to offer the best value to the Postal Service, price and other factors considered, the Postal Service will provide the de-icing and ground handling services through its agents. In this case, the air transportation supplier will not be responsible for providing ground handling or de-icing services, but will be expected to cooperate with the Postal Service's agents.</p>
<p>1.4 Service Requirements</p>
<p>The service frequency is defined within the Service Schedule for each origin and destination segment.</p>
<p>The air transportation supplier may be requested to provide service beyond the scope of the Service Schedule frequency, during the remaining term of the contract. Additionally, the air transportation supplier may be required to divert its aircraft as a result of unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of either party. In the event of such diversion, the air transportation supplier will operate at the mutually agreed upon pre-negotiated rates per block hour multiplied by the substantiated and agreed upon block hours necessary to provide the diversionary service.</p>
<p>1.5 Schedules</p>
<p>The flight schedules accepted by the Postal Service will become the contractual schedule of operations and will remain fixed for the term of the contract. This includes the aircraft types, quantity, and tail-numbered aircraft, which are proposed. The supplier must not arrive later than, nor depart earlier than, the times in the agreed upon schedule (Attachment 1) unless specifically authorized by the contracting officer.</p>
<p>1.6 Trip Cancellation</p>
<p>If the contracting officer orders a cancellation of any of the scheduled/optional flights, the supplier will be compensated based on the pre-negotiated cancellation rates.</p>
<p>A scheduled segment trip may be canceled by the contracting officer if the supplier's previous flight's non-compliant performance of service results in a "domino-effect" situation causing an inability of the supplier to meet the Postal Service's requirements for remaining flights. In the event of this reason for a Postal Service ordered trip cancellation, the air transportation supplier will not be compensated for service that was canceled.</p>
<p>1.7 Security</p>
<p>The supplier will have the responsibility to establish, implement, administer and maintain a security program that encompasses all facets of the operation and meets all Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA), Transportation Security Agency (TSA), Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), and local airport authority requirements regarding airport security. The Postal Inspection Service has the right to conduct inspections at any time.</p>
<p>Further, the supplier must cooperate fully with any security program implemented by the ground or terminal handling supplier stated within this contract or applicable through Postal regulations that complies with applicable FAA and local airport authority requirements regarding airport security or that provides for security of mail while in the supplier's custody and control.</p>
<p>The air transportation supplier will exercise due diligence to ensure the mail entrusted to them receive proper security by the employees. See Attachment 2 Personnel Screening.</p>
<p>1.8 Air Transportation System Support</p>
<p>The Postal Service intends to implement the use of the "Aircraft Schedule Alerting System (ASAS)" operated by CORE Transport Technologies, Inc. (CORE) for computer-assisted management of air transportation and associated activities for this contract.</p>
<p>The purpose is to monitor mail volume flows; establish an historical record of mail transport events; identify irregularities; recommend assessments; and certify mail handling and transportation flow events for payment.</p>
<p>This will be achieved by: (a) linking real-time flight information with pre-flight loading and post flight unloading information; (b) proactively notifying appropriate staff (Postal Service and third party contractors) of schedule anomalies that require management intervention; and (c) linking this data with contractual data to calculate budgetary impacts.</p>
<p>The supplier will be required to perform all CORE data entry functions as specified in the document attached to this contract. See Attachment 3 Data Entry.</p>
<p>1.9 FAA and Local Airport Authority Requirements</p>
<p>The supplier must comply with all lawful requirements of FAA and local airport authorities. This includes, but is not limited to, reporting flight schedules, weight and balance compliance, noise abatement, ramp access restrictions, de-icing procedures, landing restrictions, and other matters within the jurisdiction of such authorities to include liability insurance.</p>
<p><br />PART 2 CONTRACT CLAUSES</p>
<p>2.1 Clause 4-1 General Terms and Conditions (July 2007)<br /><br />a. Inspection and Acceptance. The supplier will only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Postal Service reserves the right to inspect or test supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Postal Service may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. The Postal Service must exercise its post acceptance rights (1) within a reasonable period of time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered and (2) before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the items, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. <br />b. Assignment. If this contract provides for payments aggregating $10,000 or more, claims for monies due or to become due from the Postal Service under it may be assigned to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any federal lending agency, and may thereafter be further assigned and reassigned to any such institution. Any assignment or reassignment must cover all amounts payable and must not be made to more than one party, except that assignment or reassignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee for two or more parties participating in financing this contract. No assignment or reassignment will be recognized as valid and binding upon the Postal Service unless a written notice of the assignment or reassignment, together with a true copy of the instrument of assignment, is filed with: <br />1. The contracting officer; <br />2. The surety or sureties upon any bond; and <br />3. The office, if any, designated to make payment, and the contracting officer has acknowledged the assignment in writing. <br />4. Assignment of this contract or any interest in this contract other than in accordance with the provisions of this clause will be grounds for termination of the contract for default at the option of the Postal Service. <br />c. Changes <br />1. The contracting officer may, in writing, without notice to any sureties, order changes within the general scope of this contract in the following: <br />a. Drawings, designs, or specifications when supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for the Postal Service in accordance with them; <br />b. Statement of work or description of services; <br />c. Method of shipment or packing; <br />d. Places of delivery of supplies or performance of services; <br />e. Delivery or performance schedule; <br />f. Postal Service furnished property or facilities. <br />2.

If any such change affects the cost of performance or the delivery schedule, the contract will be modified to effect an equitable adjustment. <br />4. The supplier's claim for equitable adjustment must be asserted within 30 days of receiving a written change order. A later claim may be acted upon - but not after final payment under this contract - if the contracting officer decides that the facts justify such action. <br />5. Failure to agree to any adjustment is a dispute under Clause B-9, Claims and Disputes, which is incorporated into this contract by reference (see paragraph s). Nothing in that clause excuses the supplier from proceeding with the contract as changed. <br />d. Reserved <br />e. Reserved <br />f. Reserved <br />g. Invoices <br />1. The supplier's invoices must be submitted before payment can be made. The supplier agrees that submission of an invoice to the Postal Service for payment is a certification that: <br />a.

Payment <br />1. Payment will be made for items accepted by the Postal Service that have been delivered to the delivery destinations set forth in this contract. The Postal Service will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and 5 CFR 1315.

The supplier must complete the form and submit it to the designated Postal Accounting Service Center to ensure the proper routing of payments. <br />2. In conjunction with any discount offered for early payment, time will be computed from the date of the invoice. For purposes of computing the discount earned, payment will be considered to have been made on the date which appears on the payment check or the date on which an electronic funds transfer was made. <br />j. Risk of Loss. Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss or damage to the supplies provided under this contract will remain with the supplier until, and will pass to the Postal Service upon: <br />1.

Subject to the terms of this contract, the supplier will be paid a percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the supplier can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Postal Service using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The supplier will not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. <br />m. Termination for Default. The Postal Service may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for default by the supplier, or if the supplier fails to provide the Postal Service, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for default, the Postal Service will not be liable to the supplier for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the supplier will be liable to the Postal Service for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. The debarment, suspension, or ineligibility of the supplier, its partners, officers, or principal owners under the Postal Service's procedures (see 39 CFR Part 601) may constitute an act of default under this contract, and such act will not be subject to notice and cure pursuant to any termination of default provision of this contract. If it is determined that the Postal Service improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination will be deemed a termination for convenience. <br />n. Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract will pass to the Postal Service upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Postal Service takes physical possession. <br />o. Warranty. The supplier warrants and implies that the items delivered under this contract are merchantable and fit for the use for the particular purpose described in this contract. <br />p.

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Description: This Request for Information (RFI) is being posted by the Marine Corps Systems Command. The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia seeks sources and information for "touch screen monitors." The touch screen monitor, meeting the minimum physical and environmental requirements, will mount for active operational use in the cab of a M1152 High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) on a universal mount (not included in this RFI). The touch screen monitor will be cabled to an Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) computer, located inside the Mobile Tactical Shelter (MTS), which mounts on the rear of the HMMWV behind the cab. The touch screen monitor will allow the user to manipulate the AFATDS remotely while occupying the cab of the HMMWV, allowing for continuous situational awareness and responsiveness of fire support assets while on the move. This touch screen will essentially act as a second monitor duplicating the screen of the AFATDS laptop. The operator will have the capability to manipulate the screen with cursor and keyboard inputs. </span></p>

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Concept of Employment: The AFATDS is a multi-service (U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps) and combined forces Fire Support Battle Command System. The touch screen monitor will be housed within the cab of the HMMWV and connected to the AFATDS laptop in the Mobile Tactical Shelter (MTS) via cabling and connectors specified in the requirements. This will allow for a user in the cab to manipulate the software present on the AFATDS laptop in the MTS via the touch screen in the cab. The specifications for the Touch Screen Monitor are as follows:</span></p>

<DESC>Synopsis <br> This is NOT an announcement for a forthcoming acquisition, but is an informational announcement and an invitation to interested U.S. entities not already participating in the VICTORY standard-specification initiative to consider participation starting in December 2013.  <br> The acronym VICTORY stands for Vehicular Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance/Electronic Warfare (C4ISR/EW) Interoperability,  which is an initiative to develop, validate, and maintain a set of open standard specifications to improve the integration approach for C4ISR/EW and related mission equipment on military ground platforms.  VICTORY standard specifications are developed for multi-vendor implementation, and the initial set of specifications is already being implemented in numerous Army and Marine Corps systems, as well as by commercial vendors.  VICTORY standard specifications are developed within a Standards Body process including both Government and Industry members, and the development effort is ongoing.  The Standards Body is encouraging additional government and industry partners to join this specification development effort.  Industry participation affords the Standards Body additional expertise.  It provides members foreknowledge of the emerging specifications, and an opportunity to help to shape their technical development.  Both aspects provide industry partners risk reduction for current and future business.  VICTORY is recognized as a critical enabler of the Army Common Operating Environment (COE), and the primary Army PEOs responsible for ground vehicles and mission equipment have issued policies requiring the use of the VICTORY standard specifications. <br> The VICTORY Standards Body began operation in May 2010.  It has produced architectural descriptions, standard specifications, reusable software and compliance verification tools.  The efforts of the VICTORY Standards Body are continuing, and interested parties still have the opportunity to participate, most notably in the following areas where focused subgroups will be forming in the near to mid-term future in order to develop new standard specifications: intelligence systems, simulation, testing, training, logistics and other specialized mission equipment system interfaces , although work will continue in other focus areas as well.  (A complete list of VICTORY focus areas appears at the end of this announcement).   <br> Most of the work of the Standards Body  is done virtually.  Occasional Face-to-Face (F2F) Technical Interchange Meetings (TIM) are held to address more complex issues and provide attendees with the top-level plans for VICTORY development and implementation.   <br> Additional details about the VICTORY initiative and Standards Body are available on the VICTORY public website -http://www.VICTORY-standards.org.  This unrestricted site provides an initial overview and information on how to register for the controlled access secure VICTORY web portal - https://portal.VICTORY-standards.org.  Registration instructions for this secure portal are available at http://www.victory-standards.org/images/agenda/portal-instructions.pdf.  Participation in the VICTORY Standards Body, and access to VICTORY artifacts, are limited to U.S. Government Agencies and U.S. Government prime contractors and subcontractors.  <br> The next VICTORY TIM will take place December 10-12, 2013 at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland.  The focus of this TIM is three-fold: 1) continue the on-going working group discussions; 2) engage new industry partners and government agencies to participate in the Standards Body; and 3) initiate the kick-off sessions for the SIGINT subgroup of Intelligence systems and for the Testing/Training subgroup.  Details and registration information for this F2F TIM are posted on the public site, http://ww.VICTORY-standards.org (click on the  quote mark Face-to-Face Meetings quote mark  link on the left side of the main page).  Additional details on the newly forming SIGINT and Test/Training subgroups are available on the access controlled VICTORY portal. <br> Formal membership in the Standards Body is NOT a requirement for participation in either VICTORY activities or acquisitions citing VICTORY standards unless explicitly called for in program-specific documents released by a contracting agency.   <br>  <br> Complete List of VICTORY Focus Areas  <br>  	Time Synchronization Service <br>  	Position Service <br>  	Orientation Service <br>  	Direction of Travel Service <br>  	Authentication Service <br>  	Attribute Store Service <br>  	Policy Decision Service <br>  	Policy Enforcement Service <br>  	Policy Store Service <br>  	Switch <br>  	Router <br>  	Data Access Cross Domain Solution <br>  	Data Signing Service <br>  	Signed Data Verification Service <br>  	Data at Rest Encryptor <br>  	Data Transfer Cross Domain Solution <br>  	Host-Based Antivirus <br>  	Host-Based Firewall <br>  	Inline Network Encryptor <br>  	Intrusion Detection and Prevention System <br>  	Network Firewall <br>  	Shared Processing Unit (SPU) <br>  	Network Attached Storage <br>  	Generic End Node <br>  	VDB Management Service <br>  	VDB Configuration Description <br>  	Information Assurance Configuration Description <br>  	C4ISR/EW Systems Configuration Description <br>  	Platform Systems Configuration Description <br>  	Networked Audio Data Source <br>  	Intercom <br>  	Voice Radio <br>  	Video or Image Sensor <br>  	Video or Image Encoder <br>  	Camera Gimbal <br>  	Threat Detection and Reporting Service <br>  	Mission Recorder <br>  	Data Radio <br>  	Electronic Warfare <br>  	SIGINT System Interfaces <br>  	HUMINT System Interfaces <br>  	IMINT System Interfaces <br>  	MASINT System Interfaces <br>  	GPS Receiver <br>  	Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Sensor <br>  	Automotive System <br>  	Power Distribution System <br>  	Remote Weapon Station <br>  	Condition-Based Maintenance System <br>  	Automatic Fire Suppression System <br>  	Articulation/Frame of Reference Sensor <br>  	Test System Interfaces <br>  	Training System Interfaces <br>  	Simulation System Interfaces <br>   <br>  <br> Technical POC:  Trent Styrcula, trent.styrcula@us.army.mil, 443-395-3721 <br>

<DESC>Synopsis <br>  <br> The function of the UBC is as a man-portable charger for various rechargeable battery configurations and chemistries (primarily lithium ion and select nickel metal hydride and nickel cadmium batteries).  The UBC will be deployed at the squad or platoon level for use in remote (Tier 1) locations where there is no commercial power grid or reliable power generation infrastructure.  Therefore it is extremely critical that the UBC must be of minimal weight and volume, survive use in a tactical environment (i.e. pass MIL-STD 810 tests) and be able to charge batteries using alternative and/or renewable energy sources along with standard AC and platform DC power sources.   <br>  <br> PURPOSE <br>  <br> This DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) is being posted to gather industry comments on the expected solicitation.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services. This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 5110-00-NIB-0041<br />Name: Scissor/Shear, Titanium blade, Straight handle, 8"<br />Description: Titanium bonded blades with straight handles and 8" overall length. Silver/light grey blades are corrosion-resistant. Blade measures 3 3/8" long and 0.075" thick. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN: 5110-00-NIB-0042<br />Name: Scissor/Shear, Titanium blade, Non-Stick, Straight handle, 8"<br />Description: Titanium bonded non-stick blades with straight handles and 8" overall length. Silver/light grey blades are corrosion-resistant and resist tape and glue. Blade measures 3 1/2"long and 0.075" thick. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN: 5110-00-NIB-0043<br />Name: Scissor/Shear, Titanium blade, Straight handle, 7"<br />Description: Titanium bonded blades with straight handles and 7" overall length. Silver/light grey blades are corrosion-resistant. Blade measures 3" long and 0.075" thick. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN: 5110-00-NIB-0044<br />Name: Scissor/Shear, Titanium blade, Bent handle, 8"<br />Description: Titanium bonded blades with bent handles and 8" overall length. Silver/light grey blades are corrosion-resistant. Blade measures 3 1/2"long and 0.075" thick. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN: 5110-00-NIB-0067<br />Name: Scissor/Shear, Titanium blade, Non-Stick, Bent handle, 8"<br />Description: Titanium bonded, non-stick blades with bent handles and 8" overall length. Silver/light grey blades are corrosion-resistant and resist tape and glue. Blade measures 3 1/2"long and 0.075" thick. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Kansas City, MO.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income. Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies. The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN: 5110-00-NIB-0041<br />ETS Stock Numbers: ACM 13529; FSK01005409; UNV 92012</p>
<p>NSN: 5110-00-NIB-0042<br />ETS Stock Numbers: ACM 14849; ACM 15121; ACM 14910; FSK 01005413</p>

<p>NSN: 5110-00-NIB-0067<br />ETS Stock Numbers: ACM 14850; FSK 01005390</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement. That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program. If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm. If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance. At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible. Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1. Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data. Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2. Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period. If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3. Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on. Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4. If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5. Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6. The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7. Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8. Provide your firm's DUNS number. The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9. Include your firm's mailing address. Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box. The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response. Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 1, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services. This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-9955<br />Name: Envelope, Transparent, Large, 10" x 13", 25 BX<br />Description: Clear front and back flexible protector bound on 3 sides with sewn black plastic edging; 1/4" metal eyelet on unsewn side for hanging - 10" x 13". UOI is BX. BX = 25 envelopes.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income. Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies. The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-9955<br />ETS Stock Numbers: ANG-1572; ESS-64209; CLI-45912</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement. That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program. If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm. If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance. At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible. Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1. Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data. Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2. Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period. If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3. Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on. Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4. If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5. Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>

<p>8. Provide your firm's DUNS number. The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9. Include your firm's mailing address. Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box. The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response. Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 1, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>

<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-1853<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	GEO 47399</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-9910<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	GEO 45333</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-9917<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 1, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>

<DESC>NOTE: THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE ONLY!
The DOE/EERE requirement for Technical Development (TD) Support Services (DE-SOL-0005186) acquisition strategy has changed.  The Golden Field Office (GFO) will now be issuing a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Mission Oriented Technical Support (MOTS) services, under DE-SOL-0006252 on behalf of DOE/EERE, to solicit eligible 8(a) small business sources who hold a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), SIN 874, 871 or 03FAC for the purpose of entering into a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).  The NAICS code for this requirement has also been changed from 541330 ? Engineering Services to 541690 ? Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.  The RFQ will be issued in November 2013.  The requirement will be for a full range of professional scientific, engineering and technical support services to assist in DOE/EERE?s mission of supporting research, development, and deployment of the transformational clean energy technologies that will be descri bed further in the Statement of Work (SOW) provided as part of the RFQ.
The Government intends to establish one BPA for Mission Oriented Technical Support (MOTS) services.  The Government understands that this RFQ crosses the domain of SINs and Multiple Award Schedules (PES (871), MOBIS (874) and Management (03FAC)).  Interested vendors are NOT required to hold ALL schedules in order to provide a quote.
The RFQ will be a total set aside for 8(a) certified concerns.  The Government will only accept and evaluate quotes that are submitted by a certified 8(a) concern.  Schedule contractors are strongly encouraged to consult with the responsible GSA and SBA representatives to ensure that any proposed CTA will be determined eligible for award under the SBA 8(a) Business Development program.

<p>Request for Comment</p>
<p>The following is a Request for Comment (RFC) and required additional information for the Base Operations Support contract for the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency at the St. Louis and Arnold, MO locations (NGA-W). This announcement provides the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Annexes 1-11 for the required base operations support services. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. NGA requires the continued base services for all of the services listed in the DRAFT PWS and Annexes attached to this announcement. The purpose of the Request for Comment (RFC) is to afford industry an opportunity to comment on any perceived issues in regard to the DRAFT PWS and Annexes 1-11 for the services and receive the benefit of industry comments. The Government's purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas, and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of the services. The Government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the DRAFT PWS and Annexes. Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package. Comments are solicited regarding the following:</p>
<p><br />1. NGA is considering issuing a firm-fixed price contract with cost reimbursable line items to provide the various base support services at NGA-W. The contract will also include a transition period of 3 months (March 1, 2014 through May 31, 2014). The anticipated period of full performance is a one year base period (1 July 2014 through 30 June 2015) with four one year option periods.</p>
<p><br />2. Comments, whether supportive or critical, are earnestly solicited regarding every aspect of the proposed DRAFT PWS and Annexes for the effort. Replies are not mandatory. Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Requests for Proposals. The use of comments received from industry to complete final performance work statement, annexes and resulting solicitation documents will be at the discretion of NGA. Any subsequent solicitations will be synopsized prior to its release. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. The Government will not critique a potential offeror's comments and the Request for Comment (RFC) should not be used by offerors to market their products/services. The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the Request for Comment (RFC). Proprietary information is not being solicited. Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3. Additional Information Required</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>Contractors are requested to provide the following information to the Contracting Officer no later than the date due below.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />a) Will you be proposing on the BOS-W contract as a Prime Contractor or a Subcontractor?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />b) The minimum required Facility Clearance for this effort is TS. Does your company have a TS Facility Clearance?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />c) The minimum required personnel clearance is TS/SCI for all services under the contract. Does your company have the required personnel clearance for this effort?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Responses to this announcement must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer at the email address (carla.r.bean@nga.mil) no later than 16</strong> <strong>May 2013 at 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Daylight Time (CSDT).</strong></p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs VA Illiana Healthcare System In Danville Illinois is seeking a contractor capable of providing Nursing Home Services in the Springfield IL Locality. Contractor must have a facility within a 5 Mile Radius of the Springfield IL City Limits.
This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines. Registration information can be found at www.sam.gov.

SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICE/COSTS
 
 This is a basic ordering agreement for the period of one year from the date of award with four (4) one (1) year options, in accordance with FAR 16.7.    A contract is formed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement, when VA agrees to place a patient in the nursing home and the nursing home agrees to accept the patient.  Upon acceptance by the contractor of beneficiaries of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), all terms and conditions of this agreement shall apply during such time as a VA patient remains in that nursing home at the expense of VA.
 
 Upon acceptance of a VA patient by the nursing home, if and when requested by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the contractor shall furnish all supplies and services herein described, at the per diem rates for the levels of care specified below.  VA levels of care are defined in Section D of this agreement.  VA is obligated only to the extent authorized placements of patients are made under this agreement.
 
 B.2 RATE DETERMINATION
 
 The per diem rate is established by the current Medicaid rate for Medicaid approved nursing homes plus a fair market amount (percentage) to cover the cost of supplies, services, and equipment above that provided under Medicaid established by the local state Medicaid agency (SMA).  Rates established after the effective date of this agreement will require a modification to the agreement.  

 VA shall use Medicaid rates for room, board, and routine nursing care.
 
 For all levels of nursing care a percentage is added for routine ancillary services/supplies, such as drugs, nursing supplies, oxygen (occasional use), x-ray, laboratory, physician visits, and rental equipment.
 
 Special equipment, e.g. clinitron bed, is/are not considered routine ancillary services (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Drug costs which comprise more than eight and one-half percent (8.5%) of the per diem rate are generally not considered routine ancillary supplies (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Rehabilitation therapies shall be provided as a distinct level of care.  Hospice Care and Dialysis are not included in the rate.  VA or other payers shall be used for Hospice and Dialysis, as determined by the veteran with VA approval.
 
 B.3 ORAL MEDICATIONS
 
 Oral medications, which comprise more than 8.5% of the per diem rate on a monthly basis, are excluded from that rate.  High drug costs shall be determined or priced using the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) of the drugs plus a transaction fee of 3% per month.  All calculations shall be made on a monthly basis.  When a high cost drug patient is identified, VA staff must be advised promptly to establish an appropriate course of action, which shall include the provision of the medications by VA.
 
B.4 	ANCILLARY COSTS
Ancillary cost are pre-approved costs for supplies or services not identified as included in the all-inclusive rate or any other pre-authorized rate or schedule or payment for items or services provided under this agreement.  Ancillary costs such as medications, special equipment, rehabilitation therapies, shall not be added to any invoice without written permission of the VA medical center placing the veteran.  If permission is received, the nursing home must also submit the physician's order for the medication/supply, the dispensing log, the supplier and the cost charged by the supplier to the nursing home, and what the nursing home is charging the VA.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK
 
   B.1. This Basic Ordering Agreement shall be conducted under the procedures of FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care shall be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psycho-social needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, X ray, and other special services for VA patients shall be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided shall include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) established in this BOA shall include the cost of medical care, drugs, laboratory, x ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted.
 
   B.2. Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living, to the maximum extent possible.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
 
   B.3. Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and shall be obtained within 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.

When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
 
  
 B.7.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this BOA dies, the nursing home shall within 48 hours notify the VA office  authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects pending further guidance by VA.

   B.10. It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA shall provide follow up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back to the community.

However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:<br />REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - All items with 21 days after date of contract award.<br />Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.</p>
<p>OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE: All items with _____ days after date of contract award.<br />(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.</p>

<p>SOLICITATION PROVISIONS</p>

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) (NOV 2011)</p>

Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) is the Nation's federal health sciences university and is committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war. We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense and the United States Public Health Service and with scientists who serve the common good. We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness. USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.<br /><br />USU intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Marshall Bioresources, located in North Rose, New York for a two (2) year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for Gottingen Minipigs.<br /><br />The minipigs will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, utilizing the test program under 13.5.<br /><br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br /><br />FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition<br />(b) Soliciting from a single source<br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.<br /><br />The Gottingen Minipig is the smallest minipgi available with limited inbreeding and high quality microbiological and genetic background. They are accepted non-rodent models in pharamacology and toxicology. The animals are barrier bred and raised in special state-of-the-art barrier production factilites, and therefore free from any porcine infectious bacterial, viral or parasitic disease. The Gottingen Minipig is specifically bred for research purposes.<br /><br />The Gottingen strain of minipigs has a full genetic background available and a large body of background data wich can be used for quality control. The many similarities between pigs and humans makes this species an excellent model for disease research and the small size and microbiologically defined health status of the Gottingen Minipig makes it a unique swine model for toxicology. The small size of the Gottingen minipig is essential to enable animal handling and irradiation, reduce experimental variation due to inhomogeneous exposure to ionizing radiation and minimize cost for new drug development.<br />Marshall BioResources is the only know source that can provided the requested Gottingent Minipigs.<br /><br />This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph<br />(c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the <br />Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and <br />Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

Specifically, this project will: (1) conduct attack surface analyses of critical services at multiple system levels; (2) characterize several MTDs with specific attributes that define their impact on critical services and mission objectives; and (3) assign and configure the best pairing of MTDs and critical services that minimize attack surfaces and maximize attacker costs.<br /><br />The submission of white papers, their evaluation and the placement of research grants and contracts will be carried out as described in the Broad Agency Announcement.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FY14 Focus Areas for C2PD</span></strong>:<br /><br />Today, defenders of computer networks are faced with an asymmetric disadvantage compared to attackers. Attackers are free to study a target network and discover its vulnerabilities at length, and then launch an attack when ready. The sum of the vulnerabilities and attack vectors available to the attacker is termed the 'attack surface'. A leading researcher in the attack surface area defines the components of the attack surface as the methods (e.g. Remote Procedure Calls), channels (e.g. TCP sockets, open ports on network computers or firewalls), and untrusted data items (e.g. database records, registry values) that can be used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the network [1]. Facing this situation, a defender can protect his network by (i) reducing his network's attack surface, or (ii) periodically 'shifting' the attack surface by changing the methods, channels, and data items available to the attacker as attack vectors. This second option is a developing field of research, where Moving Target Defense (MTD) assets are developed that can shift a network's attack surface for defensive purposes, nullifying the asymmetric time advantage currently enjoyed by the attacker.<br /><br />This proposed project addresses this area of study in three major steps. The first step is to develop a metric for calculating the attack surface of a computer network at three levels; network, host/OS, and application/service. The second step is to develop an algorithm that combines these three attack surface measurements into a single "reachability" metric. This metric will define the "reachability" of the target network, which is proportional to the effort an attacker must expend to breach the network. The third step {future} will be to develop a Command and Control (C2) tool that uses the "reachability" metric to analyze available MTD assets and predict the effect these MTDs will have on the attack surface of a defended network. Additionally, this C2 tool will analyze the effects the MTD has on the availability of the critical services provided by the network. In a live-fire environment, the C2 tool will be able to recommend MTDs for use to protect a network while ensuring that there are no conflicts between deployed MTDs that result in a loss of critical services. At this time we seek white papers addressing the challenges of first two steps described above, to measure an attack surface.</p>
<p>It is recommended that white papers be received by the following date to maximize the possibility of an award in FY 14: 18 Nov 2013. It is anticipated that awards for this particular topic will range in duration from 9 to 24 months with dollar amounts up to $500K per award.

Introduction
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for protecting the Nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. These statutory responsibilities encompass providing the most effective transportation security in the most efficient way possible as a high performing counterterrorism organization. To enhance mission performance and achieve its shared goals, TSA is committed to promoting a culture founded on integrity, innovation, and team spirit.</p>
<p>To this end, TSA requires Information Technology (IT) enterprise infrastructure support services capable of supporting the operational requirements of the agency and communications with the general public and other governmental organizations.</p>
<p>1.1 Purpose</p>

<p>Any information provided will only be used to inform TSA of the opportunities that may be available through a managed service model or other innovative IT service delivery models. Responses should include the technical pros, cons, risks, business models used, and the customer base supported via an IT service delivery model. In addition, information related to Managed Service delivery model Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and best practices for continuous improvement of IT infrastructure and operations is also requested.</p>
<p>1.2 Background and Overview</p>

<DESC>Per FAR part 8.405-6 notice for order shall be posted to FedBizOpps within 14 days of award. Due to the Government shutdown the post was not able to be submitted on time. Award was made on 9/24/2013.<br />Contracting Office ZIP Code: 30341<br />Contract Award and Solicitation Number: 200-2010-F-35288 - MOD 13 and 14; 2010-Q-11924<br />Contract Award Dollar Amount: $1,998,069.00 (Option 3, Year 4)<br />Contract Line Item Numbers: 0039, 0040, 0041 (Optional Line Items: 0042 and 0043)<br />Contract Award Date: 09/24/2013 (Option 3, Year 4)<br />Contractor: SRA International Inc. <br />Place of Contract Performance: Contractor's site
<p><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to provide contractor support for processing the data collection forms from components of the National Health Care Surveys and related data collection efforts according to specifications provided within the SOW. This is to modify services and exercise these additonal services under Option 3, Year 4.</p>
<p>SRA is the incumbent contractor currently providing services for these Tasks, all of which are related to the National Health Care Surveys. The key surveys involved, NAMCS and NHAMCS, are very complex, including a combination of traditional survey data and abstracted medical data, which requires ICD coding. Some particulars related to these surveys have changed dramatically since the initial year of this contract. Originally, the surveys were conducted on paper and pencil, and the contract requirement included extensive data entry and validation, receipt and control, and considerable medical coding. In year two of the contract, the surveys moved to a computerized data collection platform, and the sample quintupled in size. This meant that many of the data management tasks changed completely, with a reduced emphasis on keying but a much greater need for ICD coding. At the same time, several supplements were launched to collect data from the same populations, and with partially overlapping but expanded content. Although the requirements changed, all tasks covered the same survey systems, and performance of the work still required the same highly specific knowledge of content, objectives, data collection procedures, processing requirements, data verification protocols, and coding systems. The knowledge base would be lost if the task had to be started with new support. It would not be possible to process a new contract without incurring extensive additional costs and delays in the production and release of mission-critical data and the urgency of the timeline would not be met. Data from these surveys are used to monitor the effect of major developments in the U.S. health care system. The revised contract tasks were essentially designed to produce faster data that monitors much more specific geographic areas than was previously possible. The work as described in the original contract would not have met the data needs of NCHS and its external partners-rapid changes and the need for more precise data required considerable system reengineering. However, the overall nature of the data, coding requirements, and final dataset specifications remained the same, and the current contractor had very specific experience with these systems and specifications. It was necessary to retain this experience in order to meet the expanding data needs of this contract and urgent timelines.</p>

<DESC>This is an annual synopsis of Repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00383-12-G-005D with Sierracin/Sylmar Corporation, Sylmar, CA and serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis notice for all repair orders issued by the NAVSUP WSS for the period of 18 October 2013 through 17 October 2014 for the evaluation and repair of various repair components of the Navy Weapons System manufactured and repair. These componenets are:
1. Windshield Cover, AI, NIIN: 7R E 1560 014471104 GF, P/N: 271520-61
2. Windshield Cover, AI, NIIN: 7R E 1560 014113380 GF, P/N: 74A350002-1027

However, individual orders may be issued for any sole source item of repair under this Navy Weapons System.  A complete list of potential reparable items for which orders may be placed under this NAVSUP WSS BOA can be obtained upon request from the below cited point of contact.
 

Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.
 This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Hill &amp; Associates, Inc. , 2680 Production Rd Ste 101, Virginia Beach, VA 23454-5256 for a period of (6) months. The period of this extension is contemplated to be from 01 Oct 13 through 31 Mar 14. This extension is needed to satisfy the Base Supply &amp; Fuels Services requirement until award of the Base Supply Services solicitation FA9301-13-R-0007 can be completed.
<p><br />This six month extension of services is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements" as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This extension of services will further allow for the future competitive procurement for these services to be accomplished and allow for a transition of services to a potential new contractor. J.K. Hill &amp; Associates, Inc., is the only responsible offeror for extension of these services, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to this extension of services. The Government will not be<br />responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension. A determination by the Government to extend these services and not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose<br />of determining whether or not to extend these services. Any responses to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to Tylan J McBride at tylan.mcbride.2@us.af.mil and Steven E. Barry at steven.barry.2@us.af.mil.</p>

<p>2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF CONTRACT ACTION: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program (Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies). This is a limited source action to be awarded as a new FSS delivery order. The placement of a firm, fixed price delivery order is anticipated.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The proposed acquisition is for an Decentralized Medication Dispensing System Expansion provided by Carefusion Solutions, LLC, 3750 Torrey View Court, San Diego, CA 91230.</p>

The system shall support the Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals (NPSG) and Medication Management Standards. The system shall protect against unauthorized access, document use, promote pharmacist order review, and provide patient educational material. The system shall be compatible with and integrated with the Carefusion Pyxis system currently installed throughout the facility. The electrical requirement is 120VAC, 60Hz.</p>
<p>Vendor shall be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) authorized dealer, authorized distributor or authorized reseller for the proposed equipment/system such that OEM warranty and service are provided and maintained by the OEM. All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the equipment/system shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.<br />Upon delivery, the vendor shall be responsible for uncrating the unit/system, transporting it through the facility to the location of intended use for installation, and removing of all trash created in this process. If interim storage is required, the vendor shall make arrangements for the storage.<br />The system shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States. The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States. The system shall be installed in compliance with OSHA requirements.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE AND/OR DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: The statutory authority which permits restricting consideration of schedule contractors to fewer than that required in FAR 8.405-1 is 41 U.S.C. 251, as implemented by FAR 8.405-6(b)(1) - only one source is capable of responding.</p>
<p>This is an expansion to the current automated medical dispensing system at Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune and not a system replacement. Carefusion is the only vendor that can provide a decentralized medication dispensing system that is compatible with the Carefusion Pyxis system currently installed through NH Camp Lejeune. Carefusion is the only vendor with the proprietary knowledge to properly integrate the system expansion with the currently installed systems. No other vendor can provide a system that is compatible with the installed base of Carefusion equipment and can properly integrate the systems together. Pyxis MedStation meets all of the Information Assurance (IA) requirements to operate on the activity's network. Only Carefusion can provide the necessary expansion to meet the minimum requirements of the government.</p>
<p>5. DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE: A determination will be made by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d). The FSS pricing, along with the contractor's ability to meet our delivery terms will represent the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH: Market research was conducted in the end of February 2013. Search of Federal Supply Schedules identified that no other vendor can meet the minimum requirements of the government. Other vendors were identified that can provide decentralized medication dispensing systems: Omnicell Incorporated, InterMetro Industries Corporation, and McKesson Corporation. Carefusion is the only vendor available that can provide systems compatible with the currently installed base of Carefusion equipment at Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune.</p>
<p>7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: None <br /><br />8. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION: As the barriers that preclude the agency from the requirements of section 8.405-1 are due to limited vendors on schedule, no actions can be taken by this agency to remove those barriers. If additional vendors are added to the FSS for this equipment, they will be considered as applicable.</p>
