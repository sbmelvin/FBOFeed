<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk – Philadelphia Office intends to acquire on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 - a sole source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a)., with FACE Resources for the acquisition of alcohol-related promotional items covering responsible alcohol consumption targeting Sailors in the 18-24 age range.  The items include customized posters, outdoor banners, table tents, radio/TV/on-line ads, and brochures.  FACE Resources, Training  and  Action on Alcohol Issues is the sole source creator and supplier of copyrighted and trademarked alcohol-related messages known as “The Domino Strategy on How to Drink Responsibly.”  The Navy has found the Domino Strategy concept to be closely aligned with current Navy policy and guidance regarding alcohol abuse and prevention amongst Sailors.
  These items will be delivered to and stored in the Navy Logistics Library to be available to the Fleet.  The Government anticipates this requirement to be awarded as a firm fixed price contract. This notice of intent is not a request for quotes – however, the Government will consider information received by the specified response date. Information received as a result of this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government, and will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.
  Any questions regarding this announcement should be submitted via email to peter.certo@navy.mil.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:
In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.
Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.
If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable. 
52.212-2  Evaluation-Commercial Items. EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />NONPERSONAL ROMAN CATHOLIC DAY TIME PRIEST SERVICE</p>
<p>1. SCOPE OF CONTRACT</p>
<p>a. The Roman Catholic faith is a significant cross section of patients and staff requiring religious support at NMCSD. Approximately 30% of the hospital nature of pastoral care to Roman Catholics is sacramental in nature. The celebration and administration of sacraments requires the presence of a Catholic Priest. Therefore, it is essential that Catholic Priests are available to provide pastoral car and sacraments to Roman Catholic patients and staff at NMCSD and support deployments of Catholic priests in the civilian community has developed. This shortage is now reflected in the decreased availability of Catholic Chaplains in the naval sea services everywhere. The decreased availability of Catholic Chaplains has created a situation in which adequate Catholic coverage is not available at NMCSD by Catholic Chaplains are not available. Therefore, we need to diverse and implement new strategies to meet the spiritual and religious needs of Roman Catholics. This requires us to use Roman Catholic assets as efficiently as possible. There is also a need to identify new and additional sources for Catholic sacramental ministry.</p>
<p>b. As a result of the above issues, requirement exists to contract for the non-personal services of a Roman Catholic priest to assist the Navy Catholic chaplain to provide for the pastoral and sacramental needs of Roman Catholics at NMCSD. The civilian priest would be an independent contactor of the Pastoral Care Service chaplain team, administering sacraments, offering spiritual care and counsel, celebrating daily Mass, and responding to other Catholic religious needs as the may arise.</p>
<p>2. CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>a. The contactor shall provide sacramental and pastoral care and counseling to staff, patients and their families, prepare and maintain records, be available to celebrate daily Mass, participate in meetings required by the Director of Pastoral Care Service, and respond to other Catholic needs as they may arise.</p>
<p>b. During the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to perform on behalf of the U.S. Government, the duties of a Roman Catholic priest for the spiritual care of active duty military personnel, their dependents, eligible Navy civilian employees, and other beneficiaries, per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>c. As an independent contractor, all medical, dental, and professional liability insurance is the responsibility of the contractor.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>
<p>(c) DoD shall promptly review the Contractor's assessment, and the Procuring Contracting Officer shall provide a written notification to the Contractor including-</p>
<p>(1) A statement as to whether DoD agrees that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract; and</p>
<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #1a1a1a;">This request will be used to screen the Tox21 10K library with an assay for DNA damage.&nbsp; The assay works by detecting the phosphorylation of histone H2A.X by labeling antibodies with donor and acceptor fluors (europium cryptate and d2) to enable homogenous detection in a high throughput environment. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #1a1a1a;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #1a1a1a;">This reagent is intended for the determination of levels of Phospho-H2A.X in cell lysates only when phosphorylated at Serine 139. When DNA is damaged and a double strand break occurs kinases will phosphorylate nearby H2A.X proteins on the c-terminal Serine 139. So, detection of phospho-H2A.X (S139) may thereby be used to monitor the extent of double strand breaks of DNA and help with the creation of new anticancer drugs. We use these assay kits for cell based assay screenings to test them against Tox21 library collections (10,000 compounds) in a high-throughput format.</span></p>

2.	CONTRACT TITLE.

Fully Automatic Plastic Bottle Un-scrambler / Cleaner & Multi-Purpose Bottle Carrier/Transporter


3.	BACKGROUND.

The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC) has a requirement to purchase an automated plastic bottle un-scrambler / cleaner for our bottle packaging line. The automated plastic bottle un-scrambler / cleaner is a critical piece of the bottling line. It is located at the beginning of the bottling line, and is used to unscramble empty bulk plastic bottles and  clean inverted bottles using a blast of compressed air to remove any particulate matter that may be in the bottle prior to filling them with tablets or capsules. Our current plastic bottle un-scrambler / cleaner was purchased in 2006 and is eight years old. Our current plastic bottle un-scrambler / cleaner is showing its age and parts of the machine are beginning to fail. The current company is phasing out replacement parts and will soon be unable to support this machine.

We also have a requirement to purchase four (4) multi-purpose bottle carrier/transporters for our packaging line. These units will be used to transfer bottles from one conveyor to another. This side belt transfer will need to accommodate bottles that range in size from 75cc, 100cc, 125cc, 200cc and 625cc bottles. Without these motorized transfers, bottles on the packaging line tip over causing tablets and capsules to drop on the floor making them unusable. Most of these tablets and capsules are very expensive and we have limited quantities making it essential that we do not waste any product.

4.	SCOPE.

The contractor shall provide the Fully Automatic  Plastic Bottle Un-Scrambler / Cleaner, the Multi-Purpose Bottle Carrier/Transporter, installation, training and all other resources required to deliver the requirements stated herein, except as may otherwise be specified in this statement of work.

<AWARDEE>KAISER OPTICAL SYSTEMS, 371 PARKLAND PLAZA, ANN ARBOR, MI 48103 US
<DESC>The Material Measurement Laboratory's Microscopy and Microanalysis Research Group (MMRG) conducts research on the development of innovative metrologies and measurement protocols for micro/nano-scale heterosystems analysis. Measurement techniques are used to determine sample composition as well as structural, electronic, and chemical properties of a wide variety of organic, inorganic and biomolecular systems where materials of interest are typically present as either micro/nano-scale features or monolayer/multilayer films. To meet mission requirements; the MMRG needs to procure a Raman Microscopy platform to improve analysis of micrometer to sub-micrometer materials systems. Pursuant to this application, the Raman microscopy platform must be fully compatible with the Kaiser Optical, holographic System optical elements and mechanical components to yield optimal performance with respect to detection efficiency, frequency agility, and/or automation (optomechanical pin-to-pin compatibility).
