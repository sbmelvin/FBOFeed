The contractor shall provide Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 whole genome array chips and shall analyze total RNA samples to include Robust Multi-Array Average Analysis (RMA) to model probe affinity, Permutation Analysis for Differential Expression (PADE) to provide estimates of False Discovery Rate (FDR), Reduction of Invariant Probes (REDI) statistical analysis to eliminate probes that have shown to be non-responsive, and Principle Components Analysis (PCA) to collapse the data.  The period of performance is anticipated to be 24 months from date of award.  The basis for determining Expression Analysis as the only source capable of providing the required services is that the firm  previously analyzed samples from three previous studies, RMA, PADE, PCA and Expression Analysis' proprietary REDI statistical package being used previously, and EPA's need for the same measurement techniques and comparable data to the previous studies.  The circumstance permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106(b) - only one source reasonably available and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710, with a small business size standard of 500 employees, is applicable.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualifications fully explaining there capability no  later than 15 days after the date of this publication. Consequently, any response failing to provide evidence of the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.   Submit response to US EPA, Attn: Jennifer Hill (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 via US Postal Service.  No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 611430   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), ENERGY STAR Residential Branch (ESRB) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to ACI of Waynesburg, PA.  The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain support for four (4) regional conferences and one (1) national conference that includes a Home Performance with ENERGY STAR  (HPwES) Symposium. These conferences will provide technical training and disseminate information on improving residential energy efficiency through home performance contracting?furthering the progress of meeting CPPD?s mission to identify and promote opportunities for reducing greenhouse gases.  Roughly 16 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to energy use in residential buildings.  Although reducing energy use at home is familiar to many, finding a knowledgeable contractor to both recommend and perform energy-saving home improvements is difficult.  ESRB  is working  to build a new infrastructure of contractors who can deliver whole-house energy saving solutions.  It has been determined that ACI offers a unique venue to draw a wide array of key stakeholders in the building industry to showcase HPwES. ACI has been successful at inspiring excellence in home  performance contracting by promoting a whole-house approach through national and regional conferences.  ACI is well qualified to organize and implement a conference on issues of improving residential energy efficiency through home performance contracting and is the sole organizer of conferences  that promote a whole-house approach to improving the energy efficiency of existing homes. ACI conferences are unique because of the emphasis on whole-house building performance and the niche contractors that attend are a target of EPA?s HPwES  recruitment efforts. Conferences and training sessions  will be held to present HPwES, discuss implementation issues and recruit new participants.  Support will be provided at the following sessions: Southern California HPwES Training 2006 conference, New Jersey Home Performance, RESNET National, ACI Northwest and the ACI National Conference and HPwES  Symposium?all of which are a part of  EPA?s strategy to help increase participation and recognition of the HPwES program. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 611430. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm  that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via e-mail at rodgers.jami@epa.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE.  THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPIS/SOLICITATION.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is SAQM-PD-06-R-1138 and this solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  This will be a Firm-Fixed-Price, Research and Development type of contract with multiple awards and one (1) award set-aside for small business.  Interested small businesses should also reference their 8(a), HUBZone, service-disability veteran-owned status and their American/Alaskan Native Company (ANC) status.  Upon completion of the R&D process, The Government does not guarantee future orders.  The Government intends to use NAICS: 327211, Flat Glass Manufacturing, 1000 Employee Size Standard.  The US Department of State (DOS) has a requirement to devise methods of providing radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) attenuating glazing systems for its office buildings.  The current method of achieving this goal is through the application of aftermarket window film products that incorporate proprietary materials to provide the required attenuation.  While effective, this approach does present potential technical challenges and presents a life cycle cost burden.  The intent of this solicitation is to foster development of viable alternative methods of providing comparable RF/IR attenuation that are in consonance with traditional glazing techniques and compatible with industry accepted methods of utilizing glazing elements and manufacturing/assembling windows and glazed curtain wall systems.  While by no means an exhaustive listing, potential methods to accomplish this end would be to encapsulate an RF/IR attenuating material within conventional laminated glass interlayer materials such as polyvinyl butyral (PVB) or an ionoplast interlayer (e.g. DuPonts Sentry Glass Plus) and a process of mechanically depositing an RF/IR attenuating material directly to a glass surface (e.g. sputter coating, pyrolytic deposition).  The proposal must describe the company's ability to meet the above technical and security requirements.  

OFFERS: Offers must be submitted on an SF-1449 with a completed 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items-with Duns Number Addendum, signed by an authorized representative of the offeror, OR provide a copy of the certification/validation of the contractor Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov) and Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) (http://orca.bpn.gov).  

PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR Part 35 ? RESEARCH AND DEVLOPMENT CONTRACTING, FAR 52.301 ? SOLICITATION PROVISION AND CONTRACT CLAUSES (MATRIX) FOR FIXED PRICE R&D CONTRACTS, FAR 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS FOR SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION; FAR 52.212-3, OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS-WITH DUNS NUMBER ADDENDUM, FAR 52.212-4, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES, OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS-FOR SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION. The following FAR clauses cited in paragraph (b) of the clause at FAR 52.212-5 are also applicable to this acquisition; FAR 52.222-26; EQUAL OPPORTUNITY; FAR 52.222.35, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR DISABLED VETERANS AND VETERANS OF THE VIETNAM ERA; FAR 52.222-36, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES; FAR 52.222-37, EMPLOYMENT REPORTS ON DISABLED VETERANS AND VETERANS OF VIETNAM ERA; FAR 52.225-3, BUY AMERICAN ACT SUPPLIES; AND 52.232-34, PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER-OTHER THAN CENTRAL CONTRACTING REGISTRATIONS.     
                            
The proposal shall be transmitted either by US mail or by e-mail to Frederick T. Little, Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), P.O. BOX 9115, Rossyln Station, US Department of State, Arlington, VA 22219 or littleft@state.gov or, by 4:00 PM EST on September 22, 2006.  All questions should be e-mailed to Frederick T.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) plans to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) for a variety of airborne platforms, with proven performance histories in conducting airborne science research and range support to include radar surveillance and telemetry relay capability in accordance with the Statement of Work provided with the RFQ. These aircraft are to accommodate light and heavy-lift instrumentation payloads, on fixed wing and lighter-than-air craft.  NASA will provide all payload instrumentation.   Both manned and unmanned aerial platform systems are sought to support the NASA Suborbital Science Program of the Science Mission Directorate (http://suborbital.nasa.gov) activities supporting the NASA Strategic Plan.  These services will occasionally be conducted in partnerships with other NASA collaborative partners such as the Interagency Coordinating Committee for Airborne Geosciences Research and Application.  NASA seeks only existing platform capabilities with proven records of airborne science operations, accessible at a fixed daily and/or flight hour rate over the next 5 years.  THIS IS NOT A TEST PROGRAM DEVELOPING NEW PLATFORM OR INSTRUMENT CAPABILITIES.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled "PRESTON SIGNAL CONDITIONERS/AMPLIFIERS AND PLUG-IN MODE CARDS" which was posted on 9/11/2006. You are notified that the following changes are made:  In accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6), the following additional information is provided:  The primary justification for name brand specifications for this procurement is that the Preston Scientific amplifiers, mode cards, and signal conditioners are the only data acquisition components fully compatible and interchangeable with the existing data acquisition and conversion system on the SSC test stands.  Integration of alternate equipment would require modification of existing hardware support elements, software modifications and validation of the completed system.  The goal is to make B2 DACS the same design as the other large test facilities for operational similarities/ease, similar/same equipment and software, standardized setups, etc.  Also, integration of alternate equipment and the changes to present infrastructure and software would require validation of the new system, requiring a major manpower effort, additional cost, and unacceptable test schedule impacts. The due date for responses is extended to 10/18/2006. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

This amendment (1) notifies potential offerors that responses to submitted questions will be posted by October 18, 2006 and (2) extends the due date for proposals to November 1, 2006.  Please note that no additional questions will be entertained by the Government after the posting of this amendment on the Federal Business Opportunities Website.

If you have already submitted a proposal to meet our earlier deadline of October 12, 2006, your organization may submit a modification to the proposal.  Modifications will be due by the new due date of November 1, 2006.  All changes shall be clearly identified so that the Government can be assured that it is reviewing your latest submission.  

Accordingly, offerors shall ensure that any modification to their proposal:  

(1)  states whether the modified proposal replaces the initial proposal in total, or

(2)   indicates what changes have been made by clearly identifying exactly what pages are being replaced or which pages, paragraphs, etc. have been modified. 

(3)  If an offeror decides to make no modifications to their proposal after reading the questions and responses, the offeror shall send an e-mail to Susan Labovitz at susan.labovitz@noaa.gov stating that no changes are needed to their submitted proposal.  
 
Offerors that did not submit a proposal for the first due date of October 12, 2006 may still submit an offer.

<DESC>The Department of Education intends to make an award to an 8(a) company. This is a five year contract (09/30/06 to 09/29/11). Interested vendors can call Vidya Vish at 202-245-6167 or email Vidya.vish@ed.gov.  Please submit your capability Statements     electronically by 12 P.M on Thursday, May 11, 2006.

The purpose of the study is:

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education has the following mission: (1) to collect and analyze education information and statistics in a manner that meets the highest methodological standards; (2) to report education information and statistics in a timely manner; and (3) to collect, analyze, and report education information and statistics in a manner that (A) is objective, secular, neutral, and non-ideological and is free of partisan political influence and racial, cultural, gender, or regional bias; and (B) is relevant and useful to practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and the public.

NCES collects statistics on the condition of education in the United States, analyzes and reports the meaning and significance of these statistics, and assists states, local education agencies, and postsecondary institutions in improving their statistical systems. NCES supports a wide range of activities, providing policy-relevant data on issues as diverse as enrollment trends, access of minorities to postsecondary education, the academic achievement of students, comparisons of the U.S. education system with education systems in other countries, and the association between education and economic productivity.

The Decennial Census School District 2000 Project provides NCES with a vehicle for identifying special data tabulations containing aggregated data describing attributes of children, families, and households in each school district in the Nation.  This project brings together school district geographic boundaries as obtained through a Department of Education sponsored survey of state liaisons on school district geography (funded through the Title 1 Program) with the census data.  Paper and digitized maps developed by the individual states are sent to the Census Bureau; the Census Bureau transforms this information to a TIGER/Line file format as a means to tabulate address-oriented data.  Once mapped, census blocks are uniquely associated with their respective school districts.  Census tabulation blocks are then aggregated to provide estimates for school districts, counties, states, and the U.S. using both long and short form data.  The data are tabulated for different types of school districts (elementary, secondary, unified), various age categories of children, and households and families.  Virtually, all long and short form data elements are used for these special tabulations.

The use of the Decennial Census for statistical and programmatic projects at the National Center for Education Statistics dates from the early 1970's.  Census data have provided the agency an opportunity to present detailed demographic, social, and economic data tabulated at the school district level.  Such data, as provided by the long and short form of the census, have given the agency, state and local education policy analysts, and education research analysts a once in a decade snapshot of the economic and social demography of individual public school districts across the Nation.

This RFP defines the support for the Department of Education's NCES in maintenance, upgrade, update software and revise the   NCES School District Demographic System, an interactive Mapping Online System, for 2000 Decennial Census School District Demographics System.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Opportunity for Technical Assistance
<DESC>Subject Notice of Opportunity for Technical Assistance was posted today (10/11/2006) by the Golden Field Office at this DOE IIPS website.  It is Opportunity Number DE-PS36-07GO97008.  The following summary is provided; however, you may access the full Opportunity at the Golden Field Office section of the website: In January 2006, the President announced his Advanced Energy Initiative. An integral part of this Initiative is the U.S. Department of Energyâs (DOEâs) Solar America Initiative (SAI).  The goal of the SAI is to reduce the cost of solar photovoltaic technologies so that they become cost-competitive by 2015. To complement the R&D and testing/evaluation activities that are the backbone of the SAI, the DOE will conduct Market Transformation (MT) efforts.  MT activities fall into two areas: 1. activities which provide technical, regulatory, institutional, financial and educational solutions to Market Transformation barriers; and 2. those which accelerate demand for new solar technologies primarily through provision of technical assistance. There are several aspects to SAI that define it as a new approach for DOE and should be kept in mind by applicants in formulating applications:  1. SAI MT is looking to identify and remove market barriers; 2. SAI MT is looking for significant market changing activities; 3. SAI MT is focused on near- and mid-term results; and 4. SAI MT is looking for performers and partners who are committed to the SAI mission. Solar America Showcases Description/Objectives The purpose of Solar America Showcases (SAS) is to accelerate demand for solar technologies among key end use market sectors.  Under this activity, DOE will provide Technical Assistance to large-scale (in excess of 100kW), high-visibility solar installation projects that have the ability to impact the market for solar technologies through large project size, use of a novel solar technology, and/or use of a novel application for a solar technology.  In addition, it is desired that the project be replicable or have replicable components.  It is not expected that all projects will meet all of these parameters, but projects would ideally reflect some or most of these qualities. Large-scale installations may include photovoltaic, concentrating solar power, and solar water heating applications. DOE will not purchase hardware or otherwise provide direct funding to organizations selected from this Notice. Technical Assistance described under this Notice will be provided via a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between DOE, the organization selected to receive the Technical Assistance, and the Tiger Team members providing the Technical Assistance.   A MOA is a collaborative agreement between the Federal Government and other parties to work together on a mutually beneficial activity.  The MOA will detail the scope of the Technical Assistance activities, the forms of collaboration, the responsibilities of the partners to the Agreement, and the treatment of any potential intellectual property.  Federal funding cannot be provided to a partner under a MOA.

<SUBJECT>HIGH ENERGY LASER WEAPON SYSTEMS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane has a requirement in support of Naval Sea Systems Commands Directed Energy and Electric Weapon Systems (DE&EWS) Program Office (PMS 405) and is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to determine the general availability of components / equipment / subsystems / systems that could comprise a High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS) and to determine viability for integration into an incrementally-fielded, spiral capability HELWS for usage by all military services and Department of Homeland Security.  PMS 405 is interested in existing / planned efforts that would allow for leverage of existing and/or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items into militarily useful laser weapon systems within two to three years. Emphasis should be placed on an initial capability that could counter a subset of asymmetric threats such as jet skies, small boat swarm attacks, rockets, mortars, artillery rounds, manpads, electro-optic sensors, and soft unm!  anned aerial vehicles. The system should be multi-mission capable and able to support electro-optic surveillance missions as well as laser engagements. As laser and laser beam control technology matures the system should be able to support upgrades that expand the potential target set, surveillance capabilities and operating range of the system.  PMS 405 and its technical designees would be the Technical Design Agent responsible for integration of the various detect, track, process, and engage elements that will comprise HELWS baselines.  HELWS is projected to be:  	Initially an independent capability that can be fielded as either a transportable system for land based use or as a stand-alone / minimally-integrated capability for ship board use. 	A future Navy shipboard capability that could be integrated into the ship's combat systems consistent with the Department of the Navys Open Architecture (OA) thrust to support future Surface Navy needs. Responses to this RFI should not exceed fifty (50) pages, including a one (1) page corporate capability and a statement of capability in engineering analysis.  The RFI must contain the following information: a system / subsystem / component capability statement which includes information on the type of technology used, producibility, a brief analysis of lethality, laser propagation and target vulnerability, pricing information, an assessment of risk and Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and a delivery schedule.  In the response, vendors should clearly mark any information that is proprietary.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE JOB CORPS PROGRAM


New Haven Job Corps Center, operated by Career Systems Development Corporation, is located in New Haven Connecticut. There are a total of 200 students, including 50 non-resident trainees, all from the local community, who come to the Center each day for training.  

Residential trainees are recruited primarily from surrounding communities and the northern and southern portion of Connecticut.

The program meets the needs of each individual in four (4) specific areas that enable the trainee to become successfully employed.  Although many other needs are also being met, the program focuses on building vocational skills, developing academic skills and increasing awareness of social skills and core values.

Besides educational and vocational opportunities, trainees receive free housing, meals, medical and dental care, as well as living and clothing allowances.  There are daily recreational activities and outings scheduled weekly for all trainees who wish to participate.  Counseling services are available to assist trainees with their individual needs.

When training is completed and/or trainees are ready to leave, Career Transition services are provided.  In addition, trainees who leave and are pursuing independent living are provided assistance with their transition.




 



BIDDER?S INSTRUCTIONS


Bidder?s attention is drawn to the Request for Proposal and tentative subcontract attached.  It is anticipated that the draft subcontract shall become the final contractual document provided to the successful bidder, with minor revisions incorporating appropriate aspects of the bidder?s proposal.  Bidders should therefore review the format and clauses in order to prepare a response to provide Physician services.  In addition, Job Corps? Policy and Requirements Handbook (PRH), Appendices, and Technical Supplements may be reviewed in the office of Mr. William Johnson, Purchasing Agent.

The successful bidder will be selected based upon a combination of professional expertise, quality of technical services and reasonableness of cost.  Bidders are placed on notice that bids in excess of available funding for Physician services may not be found within the competitive range.  The New Haven Job Corps Center reserves the right to reject any and all bids if no individual bid is found to be acceptable.

The bidding guidelines indicate minimum staffing/service requirements which must be provided.  Bidders are encouraged to offer supplemental staffing/services either on or off Center.  Bidders should specifically state what types and quantity of supplemental staffing and/or services are being offered.

The New Haven Job Corps Center reserves the right to award a subcontract as a complete contract package including services and material, or as a services only contract.

Proposals must not just repeat the requirements contained in the RFP/Draft Contract, but must provide the specifics of ?who, what, how and when? clearly indicating the bidder?s level of understanding and ability to provide the level of service required.  It is not anticipated at this time that there will be a ?best and final? opportunity to refine proposals.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will play a central role in the development of policy and strategies for humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other designated vulnerable groups for the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).  The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will be a member of the Technical Assistance Group. Located within the Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM), the Technical Assistance Group (TAG), was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster relief mandate. TAG is sub-divided into various groups that address Food Security, Shelter and Settlements, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.  The incumbent will also play a central role in the implementation of the USAID's IDP and protection policies and coordination within USAID, and in conjunction with other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, donors, and non-governmental partners.  The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will have substantial knowledge of current development and disaster theory and research regarding IDPs and protection, and practical experience in the field, working with private voluntary organizations (PVOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or international organizations (IOs) at resettlement or disaster response locations.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The DRM Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster contexts.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support Division (OFDA/PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OFDA/OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, the Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).  

OFDA is mandated to respond rapidly to emergencies, providing assistance to those populations that have been uprooted from their homes, known as internally displaced persons.  There are an estimated 25 million people displaced throughout the world.   Internally displaced persons often are among the neediest and most vulnerable populations in a disaster situation.  They are separated from their houses and property, their lands, and sometimes their families, torn from their livelihoods.

OBJECTIVE

The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will be assigned to the TAG and will work closely with the staff of the Office of the Director.  The incumbent will be a senior advisor to OFDA on policy and program issues regarding protection, IDPs and other vulnerable populations. 

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The position involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development and execution of USAID policy and programs within a broad and complex geographic and functional specialty area.  This requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data that is often vague, unsubstantiated or contradictory.  The work is complicated by the need to provide expert advice and guidance to the decisions and actions of senior policy officials, and to quickly, accurately and decisively determine the significance of information to the policy interests of the USG.  As part of this effort, the advisor must be able to rapidly identify and anticipate problem issues, help formulate strategic and programming priorities, and write under tight deadlines to produce widely disseminated analytical products that represent official assessments of complex issues as well as keep the policy-making and foreign affairs communities continuously informed of new issues and developments. The work requires extremely strong writing and verbal skills.  

Collaboration with other offices, bureaus and agencies within and outside of the USG is also critical to this position.  Contacts will be with the Department of State and USAID employees at all levels, personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in other agencies, congressional staff, experts, United Nations (UN) staff, representatives of other donor governments, consultants, researchers and educators, and officials of non-governmental organizations.  Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings in Washington, foreign capitals, and in the field.  The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will participate in open meetings and conferences where s/he may be called upon to explain and defend USAID activities/approaches with regard to internal displacement and protection. 

Specific duties and responsibilities are as follows:

* Serve as an authoritative source of information on and analysis of internal displacement and protection issues for OFDA.  Provide leadership for the identification, research, analysis and development of recommendations on all issues and matters relating to protection, IDPs and other vulnerable populations;


* Help coordinate development of clear and articulate policy on internally displaced persons and protection issues for OFDA and USAID in general.  Make decisions and provide guidance that significantly affect OFDA and Agency IDP and protection policies;

* Serve as a key member of and provide guidance and direction to the DCHA Protection Working Group;

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-07-10005, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $10.0 million to qualify as a small  business, is applicable.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the analysis of serum samples for the Mechanistic Indicators of Childhood Asthma (MICA) Study.  A. Background Information.  A population-based case-control study of air pollutants and asthma will be initiated in Wayne County, Michigan.  This area has historically high levels of air pollutants. The recruitment goal is 150 asthmatic cases and 50 controls (9-12 year olds).  These individuals will answer detailed questions on medical history, smoking in the home, diet, and residential mobility.  Environmental chemicals such as lead, mercury, cadmium  and manganese have been shown to cause neurological damage through toxicant-induced injury.  Neurotypic and gliotypic proteins can be used to detect and characterize the injury.  Serum samples will be collected from the 200 participants in the MICA study.  Antibodies directed against nervous system specific proteins will be measured by a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as biomarkers of immune function.  Titers for anti-neurofilament (NF?s) triplet proteins, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) will be measured in the serum samples.  B. Purpose and Objectives. The objective of this contract is to analyze serum collected from 200 participants for titers of anti-NF triplet proteins, anti-GFAP, anti- MBP.  The results of these measurements will be compared to the amount of heavy metals in air and house dust samples to determine whether there is a dose dependent relationship between metal exposure and autoimmunity induced by metals.  C. Contractor Requirements.  The contractor must have demonstrated knowledge of neurotoxicology as demonstrated by a degree in a  neurotoxicological field and/or by publication record.  The contractor shall submit a list of all publications in which they analyzed for the materials listed below prior to contract award. The contractor shall analyze a total of 200, 500 ul serum samples and shall report the titers for anti-neurofilament (NF?s) triplet proteins, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and anti- myelin basic protein (MBP). The ELISA assay shall be reproducible and the intra-assay and inter-assay reliability shall exceed 0.9 and the coefficients of variation shall be below 4%.  The threshold of detection for the assay shall be no greater than 0.20 ng/ml.  The range of the standard curve shall cover, at a minimum, the range from 0.20 ng/ml to 2,000 ng/ml.  If sufficient serum can be obtained from the blood samples, the EPA researchers may send blind duplicate samples to the contractor for analysis to gauge the  reproducibility of the sample analysis process.  The contractor shall provide to the EPA task officer the results of the analyses in a written report (see Deliverables Section, below).  The contractor shall provide the results of all  applicable information from the analysis of calibration standards and standard reference materials.  The contractor shall be responsible for the disposal of all materials used in the analysis work. D. Government Responsibilities. The government researchers will be responsible for selecting and providing the 200, 500 ul serum samples.  The EPA anticipates one sample set of 200 samples, to be shipped within 30 days of the end of sample collection.  Since the samples will only be identified by a code number, the EPA project officer will provide a list of samples using the sample identifiers used in the study and allow the contractor to verify the number of samples in each sample set received for analysis. E. Deliverables.  The contractor shall provide to the  EPA task officer the results of the sample, calibration standards and standard reference materials analyses in both hard copy and electronic format (Excel ver. 5.0 or later, or Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows ver. 5 or later spreadsheets on a 3.5" floppy disc or CD) in a report when all chemical analysis work and data analysis are complete.  The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE will be 24 months from date of award. The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.  Evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: A. TECHNICAL CRITERIA: 1)Demonstrated ability to measure all of the nervous system specific proteins listed in the Statement of  Work in 500 ul serum samples with the range and sensitivity listed in the Contractor Requirements Section.  2)Knowledge of neurotoxicology as demonstrated by a degree in a neurotoxicological field and/or by publication record.  Added consideration will be given to publications that include measurement of the nervous system specific proteins listed in the Statement of Work.  B. PAST PERFORMANCE:  Submit a list of 3 customers for whom like or similar sample analysis have been performed within the past 2 years.  Include specific points of contact and phone numbers.  Past performance will be evaluated on 1) quality of product or service; 2) timeliness of performance (ability to adhere to deadlines); and overall customer satisfaction.  C.  PRICE.  Award will be made to the offeror whose offer is determined the most advantageous (best value) to the government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are  being requested and a more detailed solicitation is available on the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FEDTEDS) Web Page at http://www.fedteds.gov/  or at https://www.fedteds.gov/fedteds/start.nsf/frm.VendorLogin?OpenForm&SolicitationNumber=W912HZ-06-T-00 42 , which includes exhibits that could not be posted as this site. Offerors should check the FEDTEDS Web Page often for new solicitations and/or changes (AMENDMENTS) to existing ones. Solicitation Number W912HZ-06-T-0042 is being issued as a request for q uotation (RFQ) with the intent to award as a simplified acquisition. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  This procurement is SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE under NAI CS Code 561990 (SIC 7389) with a size standard of $6.5 M. The USACE, Vicksburg District, Consolidated Contracting Office, proposes to award a simplified acquisition to furnish all the necessary labor and materials to dewater a section of the upstream area of the American Dam, El Paso, Texas, and to remove the ground water in the inspection area along the upstream edge of the concrete apron and sheet pile cutoff, (USIBWC will excavate the inspection pit) to permit inspection of the sheet pile by Government E ngineers.  Dewatering of the inspection area will be to approximately 3 ft below the base of the excavated pit.  The base of the excavated pit will be approximately to a depth of 9 ft below the upstream concrete apron, corresponding to approximately elevation 3,667 f t MSL (see profile in Figure 2).  The dewatered ground water level will be maintained 3 ft below this elevation for a period of approximately 5 days.  The excavated work pit will consist of:  a)  approximately a 15 ft long x 15 ft wide x 9 ft deep excavated area against the upstream edge of the sheet pile cutoff wall, and  b) an excavated approach area with approximately a 1V:5H slope to permit working in the excavated area without the requirement for shoring.  The total excavated area may be modified slightly because of the site conditions or excavation requirements for the  equipment.  However, it is expected that the total excavated area will measure approximately 60 ft x 60 ft and will be dewatered to provide access for equipment and inspection of the upstream sheet pile cutoff. The inspection can only be done during the non-irrigation season which extends from approximately September 1, 2006 through March 10, 2007.  The dates for inspection of the sheet pile will be coordinated with ERDC, the Contractor, and the IBWC.  The dewate ring and inspection shall be performed during the non-irrigation season.  The dewatering and inspection will be completed no later than the March 1, 2007.  There is always some degree of flow in the river and the chance of precipitation is likely. The USIBWC will provide an excavator and an operator to open the pit.

The contractor shall furnish all necessary labor and materials to dewater the excavation to permit inspection and sampling of the sheet pile by ERDC engineers.  The contractor shall provide all pumps, installation of wells, drains, etc., to perform the nec essary dewatering.  The contractor shall be responsible for the security of their equipment and its service (fuel and maintenance).  The contractor shall dewater the area such that the ground water is at least 3 ft below the base of the pit and the extende d excavation area and will maintain this level of dewatering for approximately 5 days to permit the inspection and sampling of the sheet pile .  At the end of the project, the contractor shall remove the dewatering system and/or grout the wells in accordance with the State of Texas rules and regulations.  The Contractor shall submit a dewatering plan for approval by ERDC and USIBWC before work c an commence.  The plan shall contain a schedule for mobilization, execution, and demobilization, including removal and/or grouting of the well system. Quality Control and Quality Assurance The contractor shall establish a quality control program to assure the requirements of the contract are provided as specified. Quality Assurance:  The Contracting Officer Representative (COR) will troubleshoot issues and inspect/accept services provided under the contract.  The COR will help resolve problems due to unusual site conditions, answer any questions that may arise, and assist with the coordination between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission (US IBWC or IBWC) representatives for the American Dam Dewatering. Performance:  Performance will begin after award of the contract and the notice to proceed has been given.  Performance factors will include the approval of the dewatering plan by the ERDC and IBWC representatives.  This approval must be granted before any  work can proceed.  A plan of progress for the dewatering will be developed to include performance based measures.  One metric for contract performance will be to measure the water table in the dewatering area and maintain a log of water table measurements  on a fixed schedule to identify drawdown levels in the dewatered area.  A record of water table elevations in the dewatering area will provide measured performance levels of accomplishment. Deficiencies:  Deficiencies will include the failure to meet the proposed time schedules for dewatering, after an agreed upon date for the work is accepted by all three parties involvedThe Contractor, ERDC, and the IBWC.  Deficiencies will also include fa ilure to dewater to the maximum elevation specified under this contract.

The following clause is incorporated in full text

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) - ADDENDUM
52-212-2(a) is hereby tailored as follows:

(a) The Government will award a Firm, Fixed Price commercial contract resulting from this solicitation to the lowest priced, technically acceptable (LPTA) responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.   Offerors are required to submit a technical proposal and a price proposal according to the factors set forth under this provision.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
	
FACTOR 1 ? TECHNICAL CAPABILITY
FACTOR 2 ? PRICE

FACTOR  1: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY

To be considered for award, an offeror?s technical proposal must be rated as acceptable. To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must provide the requested services within the timeframe established and per the statement of work in the solicitation and all information and/or requirements listed.  Failure to submit any of the listed requirements will result in the offeror?s technical proposal being determined technically unacceptable.

The standard is met when:

??	The offeror provides a brief, descriptive statement indicating the offeror?s credentials to deliver the services sought and within the time established under this RFP.
??	The offeror provides a brief description of how long the offeror has been performing the services required by this RFP and include the number of years in business.
??	The offeror provides a brief description of the organizations number of employees, client base, and location of offices.  
??	The offeror provides the below information for one (1) relevant and recent government or commercial contracts.  See below for description of recent and relevant.  

Company Name
Project Title
Contracting Agency
Contract Number
A Brief Description of the Contract Effort
Type of Contract
Period of Performance
Original Contract value ($) and current value ($)
Point of Contact Name, Address, Telephone Number, and Fax Number

1.  RECENT.  For a contract to be considered recent, the contract must be performed or completed within the last three years (October 2003 through the current date).

2.  RELEVANT.  A government or commercial contract in which the contractor *satisfactorily* performs vehicle leasing services similar to those identified in the statement of work.
 	
*Satisfactory performance will be determined by the acquiring activity for the referenced contract   

FACTOR 2: PRICE

Only price proposals submitted by offerors whose technical proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for evaluation.  Award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable, responsible offeror.  Proposed prices will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed in FAR 15.404-1(b) to determine price reasonableness. 

Any inconsistencies (whether real or apparent) in price must be clearly justified.  For example,  if unique and innovative approaches are the basis for an abnormally low proposed price, the nature of these approaches and their impact to the proposed price must be completely documented.  The burden of proof for cost credibility rests solely with the offeror.  The following evaluation criteria shall apply: 

COMPLETENESS:  Price will be considered complete when the offeror has proposed firm fixed prices for CLINS 0001 through 0006.  Offers for partial quantities will not be considered for award.  Price will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror provided sufficient data as required by the solicitation and/or Contracting Officer during the evaluation.

REALISM:  Prices will be evaluated to determine if they are unrealistically high or low in comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate and other offers received.  

REASONABLENESS:  Prices will be determined reasonable by competition and balance.

Offerors are cautioned against submitting a materially unbalanced offer.  The Government will analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to prices or separate line items.  Offers that are determined to be materially unbalanced may be rejected.  An offer is mathematically unbalanced if it is based on prices which are significantly less than the cost for some contract line items and significantly overstated in relation to cost for others.  An offer is materially unbalanced if it is mathematically unbalanced, and if:

There is reasonable doubt that the offer would result in the lowest overall cost to the Government, even though it is the lowest evaluated offer; or

The offer is so grossly unbalanced that its acceptance would be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced.  

(b)  Not used.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
