<DESC>The Education for Income Generation and Conflict Mitigation in Nepal program is designed to respond to a root cause of conflict?exclusion of disadvantaged youth from relevant education, training and employment opportunities. This multifaceted program will combine literacy and life skills education; technical and vocational training linked to employment; training to increase agricultural productivity and raise rural incomes; and targeted scholarships for disadvantaged youth (e.g., internally displaced persons, low caste groups, ethnic minorities and girls) to increase access to primary, secondary and higher level (10+2 and college certificate level) education. A cross-cutting theme throughout all of these activities will be the provision of peace and reconciliation education for all participants in order to develop the knowledge, attitudes and skills for conflict resolution, peace building, and the promotion of human rights. The primary beneficiaries of this program will initially be disadvantaged, conflict-affected and internally displaced youth throughout mid-western Nepal. However, if Washington approves, the Mission intends to expand the number of target beneficiaries of this program to include former Maoist combatants. This is a five-year activity, including three base years and two option years, with an estimated budget of $12-$16 million.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to conduct arcjet testing of an ablative thermal protection system (TPS) material. The Mars Science Laboratory Entry, Descent and Landing Instrumentation (MEDLI) project has been approved to incorporate an atmospheric data system into the Mars Science Laboratory heatshield, for collecting valuable environmental data during the Mars entry.  This data system includes a series of pressure ports, through the TPS, which feed to pressure transducers mounted inside the aeroshell.  The MEDLI project is on a very aggressive schedule, and an early determination of the proper port configuration is critical to successful integration with the MSL schedule.  A matrix of arcjet tests is necessary to find the port diameter that can be sustained under pyrolysis and ablation, providing a good pressure measurement without compromising heatshield integrity.  Expected conditions at the pressure port locations range between 60 and 110 W/cm2 in heat rate, and 0.1 to 0.3 atmospheres in pressure.  The test matrix consists of 9 points spanning these conditions, with 3 port diameters to be compared at each condition.  Approximately six survivability tests at 225 W/cm2 will be required, once the optimal port diameters are determined.	NASA will fabricate all of the necessary samples.  The facility shall also have the ability to safeguard proprietary materials, such as keeping the test samples in a locked cabinet and limiting personnel access to the tests.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the arcjet testing services from Boeing, Inc. who is the only known commercial source for providing these arcjet testing conditions.  While NASA facilities have been identified that can perform the services, the facilities cannot accommodate the required schedule.  NASA intends to commence the tests in late January 2007 to define the configuration. The authority for this action is the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), and 10 USC 2304(c)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 15, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Description This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.   This is a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS). The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation will be  issued on or about 01 May 2007, will include a draft  Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A best value source selection will be considered as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the nine AFSSS field stations located in Glennville GA, Hawkinsville GA, Hollandale MS, Lewisville AR, San Diego CA, Truth or Consequences NM, Wetumpa AL, Maricopa AZ, and Archer City, TX.  The AFSSS has been identified as a critical defense system and, therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis.  Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor?s personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war.  The AFSSS stations are remotely located on a constant path across the southern United States from Georgia to California and consist of six receiver and three transmitter stations.  Energy emitted from the transmitter stations forms a fixed position, fan shaped beam very narrow in the north-south direction and extends across the continental United States in the east-west direction.  One or more of the receiver stations receives energy reflected from satellites penetrating this beam.  AFSSS stations provide satellite metric data to the Dahlgren Computational Center.  The subsequent contract will include a projected ninety-day phase-in period (1 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008).  The Government  anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years.  Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost reimbursable logistics CLIN.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman.  As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil .

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.              
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. (End of clause)

Request for Information (RFI) #1
Date:  16 November 2006


THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.

GENERAL INFORMATION.  The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), Brooks City-Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A&E) firms to perform worldwide Title I, Title II, and other A&E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Family Housing (MFH), Military Construction (MILCON), and Sustainment, Restoration and Maintenance (SRM) programs of interest to the government.  We anticipate multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts using NAICS code 562910.  The small business size standard associated with this NAICS code is 500 employees.    We currently anticipate awarding approximately 15-20 contracts to large and small businesses.  All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase.  At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Time & Materials (T&M) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) depending on the nature of the requirement.

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates interceptor aircraft to detect, deter and mitigate threats to our homeland such as terrorists, acts of terrorism, drug smuggling and other unlawful movement of people, money, and goods across U.S. borders.  CBP wishes to explore the feasibility and practicality of upgrading the avionics and mission systems, initially on its 10 Citation II Lot III jets and potentially the remaining 16 Citation II jets.  The intent of the upgrade is to improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness as well as lower life cycle support costs.  To reduce program costs and enhance equipment availability and support, the avionics and sensor systems should incorporate open architecture and "commercial-off-the-shelf" non-developmental item equipment to the maximum extent possible.  Those systems must be cost effective to operate and fully supportable (parts, technical assistance, etc.) for 20 years beyond the date of acquisition.  They should also be currently in production, operationally viable (demonstrable) and capable of being easily retrofitted with updated configurations. 



2.0	REQUEST

CBP is seeking information on prime contractors who can install and integrate commercially available avionics and sensor systems, including electronic flight instrument displays that are night vision goggle compatible and reduced visual separation minimum (RVSM) compliant.  The sensor suite will include multi-mode radar and electro-optical/ infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  System performance, size, weight, power and cooling requirements and life cycle support will be important considerations for this modernization effort.  The Maximum combined weight for the complete integrated Radar and EO/IR system shall not exceed 370 pounds.  Interested vendors must be capable of demonstrating their avionics and sensor systems as an integrated end product.  



MINIMUM OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS (GENERAL):



2.1	Radar System

AN/APG-66 radar, which are currently installed in the modified noses of CBP Citation Interceptor jets, are integrated with EO/IR sensors and capable of slewing EO/IR tracked targets.  Replacement radar should have comparable system performance, size, weight, power and cooling requirements as that radar.  At a minimum, the radar should provide 120-degree azimuth and elevation coverage with an automatic capability to detect and track air and surface targets.  Radar capabilities should include the following:

	Air-to-air radar detection, tracking and sorting of various size aircraft;
	Air-to-ground radar detection, tracking and sorting of moving vehicles;
	Air-to-sea radar detection, tracking and sorting of various size vessels;
	Air-to-ground high-resolution radar imaging;
       Radar Slave to EO/IR Functionality;
	10 target (minimum) Track While Scan mode; and
	2 target (minimum) Situation Awareness Mode (SAM)

The radar system should include a Built-in-Test (BIT) mode to accomplish failure detection and failure isolation to a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) without the assistance of radar support equipment at the organization level.

The EO/IR sensor shall be housed in a 360-degree continuous rotation turret that is capable of performing long-range visual search, surveillance, and tracking from an airborne platform.  It should be capable of performing those functions in the visible light spectrum as well as the mid-wave infrared spectrum.  The EO/IR sensor shall be interfaced with the radar, capable of slaving to tracked radar targets, and providing automatic focus and video tracking in all electro-optical and infrared modes with operator selectable optical focal lengths.  Additional functionality shall include an eye-safe laser range finder for determining the range to a target of interest and a high-power laser pointer for illuminating a target of interest with night vision goggle compatible light.  The EO/IR sensor payload should include:

	A color TV camera;
	A color TV Spotter Scope; 
	An infrared thermal imager with a minimum of three distinct fields of view;
	An infrared laser range finder that is bore sighted with the sensors;
	A laser illuminator (infrared or near infrared desired); and
	EO/IR Slave to Radar Functionality


2.3	Mission Systems Operator Sensor Station

The Mission Systems Operator station should provide mission operators with the ability to control and simultaneously display and record radar and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor videos.  System architecture should include displays at the operator station and the cockpit.  Displays shall have the capability to display mapping, navigation and target information.  To allow maximum flexibility, displays should be capable of simultaneous cockpit and sensor station presentations of various airborne and maritime formats. 



2.4	FAA Certification

A Supplemental Type Certificate issued by the FAA is required for all installations, modifications and structural changes affecting the FAA certification of the Citation.

<DESC>Department of the Air Force, 21 CONS/LGCZB Operations and Maintenance Specialized Flight, 135 E. Ent Ave, Ste 105, Peterson AFB, CO, 80914-1385.  
Description:  This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal but a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the AN/FPS-133, Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS).  The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 01 May 2007 and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A best value source selection is anticipated as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group.  The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the nine AFSSS field stations located in Glennville GA, Hawkinsville GA, Hollandale MS, Lewisville AR, San Diego CA, Truth or Consequences NM, Wetumpa AL, Maricopa AZ, and Archer City, TX.  The AFSSS has been identified as a critical defense system and therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis. Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor's personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war. The AFSSS stations are remotely located on a constant path across the southern United States from Georgia to California and consist of six receiver and three transmitter stations.  Energy emitted from the transmitter stations forms a fixed position, fan shaped beam very narrow in the north-south direction and extends across the continental United States in the east-west direction.  One or more of the receiver stations receives energy reflected from satellites and other objects penetrating this beam.  AFSSS stations provide satellite and space debris metric data to the Dahlgren Computational Center.  The subsequent contract will include a projected ninety-day phase-in period (1 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008). The Government anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years.  Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost reimbursable logistics CLIN.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.  The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil.  Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.                                              
(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.              
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.  (End of clause)

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) requests information from all potential sources on available 25??x35?? Single Color Letterpress printing equipment.  This request is for commercially available equipment available for the production of security documents and products.  

The BEP is considering acquiring a printing press for its Miscellaneous Products Division.  This press is to be a single (1) color letterpress with a paper size of 25 inch by 35 inch.  The press is not required to be new, but fully operational, fully functional and in good repair.  The press will allow for better compatibility and throughput on die-cutting, numbering and scoring jobs as the large amount of modification to orders coming from the current multi-color offset press.  

The maximum sheet size required shall be at least 25?? x 35??. The maximum image (print) area required shall be at least 24?? x 34??. This sheet size will allow for a wide variety of products to be printed on this press. Minimum print size shall be approximately 11.375" x 15.750". 

The following features are desired: die-cutting, numbering and scoring capabilities. The die-cutting and scoring features must be able to operate on a minimum sheet thickness of 0.004?? and a maximum sheet thickness of 0.010??. The die-cutting/scoring features must be able to operate independently from the printing/numbering features. The ink train must be able to ink the numbering block, as the BEP uses its own numbering blocks. To accommodate the BEP numbering blocks, the cylinder bed undercut must be a 0.937?? Type High Bed with 0.020?? Backup Plate. The minimum press speed must be no less than 3500 sheets per hour. For reference only, as all submissions will be viewed equally, the Heidelberg SBD 25???? x 35???? Single-Color Cylinder Letterpress is seen as a desirable model, but not the only model that fits the needs of the BEP. 

The BEP requests all vendors to submit one (1) electronic copy and three(3)written copies of brochures, literature, specifications, drawings and/or any other information available on their commercially available equipment.

With the technical information on the equipment, the following is requested.  NOTE:  All information requested is for informational purposes only.  All cost, delivery time frame, etc is non-binding upon the vendor and is only requested to allow the BEP to adequately forecast budgets and schedules.
-	Availability (Commercial, Customizable and/or Prototype)
-	Typical Delivery Time Frame
-	Typical Cost for System
-	Optional Subsystems/Components
-	Optional Capabilities
-	Average Production Rate
-	Size and Weight of Equipment
-	Services Available on Equipment
-	Operational Capabilities
-	Equipment Status: New or Used

This information will be used to help justify the business case for such a purchase, and is not a request for proposal.

The BEP will not fund the cost to any party for the generation of their proposal.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY (RFI) for ETHANOL E85 FUELING SITE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. 

NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AND NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL RESULT FROM THIS INFORMATION REQUEST.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 447190 Gasoline Stations; the NAICS size standard is $8 million.

Market Request for Information.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is conducting a survey of existing and /or potential retail sources capable of providing E85 ethanol fueling to federal fleets in the Washington DC area.  E85 is defined as an ethanol/gasoline mixture that contains 85% denatured ethanol and 15% gasoline, by volume.

For retail sources capable of providing this E85 fueling, USDA is also seeking information concerning retail interest in possibly also providing bio-diesel fueling, at a B5 bio-diesel blend or higher, to the same market.  Bio-diesel is defined as a domestic, renewable fuel for diesel engines derived from natural oils such as soybean oil, and which meets the specifications of ASTM D 6751.  Bio-diesel blend is a blend of bio-diesel (defined above) fuel with petroleum ?based diesel fuel, designated BXX where XX represents the volume percentage of bio-diesel fuel in the blend.  For example, B5 bio-diesel is a blend that contains 5% bio-diesel and 95% petroleum-based diesel fuel, by volume.    

This request is for information on an existing or potential retail fueling locations that can provide E85 ethanol that meets the ASTM D5798-99 Standard Specification for Fuel Ethanol for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engines.  The Government is interest in fueling site(s) located inside the District of Columbia (DC) boundaries and those that meet all applicable DC codes and standards.  Source must be in compliance with all required licenses and permits.  Further, the Government is interested in sources that accept the federal fleet card for E85 fuel purchases and who have a daily minimum of twelve hours of operation and accessibility to federal fleets.  Based on U.S. Department of Energy data, there are approximately 822 Flex Fuel vehicles in the Federal fleet assigned to Washington, D.C. area.  

Interested business concerns should submit a capabilities summary that includes, at a minimum, information on past experience providing E85 and/or gasoline fuel in the District of Columbia retail market, established relationships with E85 and/or gasoline suppliers, lease or ownership of a retail fueling site or acquisition plan to obtain a suitable fueling site, experience with private industry or Government fleet fueling contracts, applicable business literature, and other information directly addressing the ability to meet the aforementioned requirements.   

Interested parties should also provide specifications to indicate how data pertaining to E85 purchases is recorded and reported from the point of sale (fueling station).   Specific product code mapping details are also desired in the submitted response.

For retail sources meeting the above requirements that are also interested in providing bio-diesel fueling at a B5 or higher bio-diesel blend these same requirements apply, substituting ?B5 bio-diesel blend that meets ASTM D 6751?for ?E85 ethanol that meets the ASTM D5798-99 Standard Specification for Fuel Ethanol for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engines? in the first sentence of the requirements and ?B5? for ?E85? elsewhere in the requirements.  

Additional Information:
There exists the potential for tax credits or other forms of financial assistance for the establishment of an alternative fueling property.  Section 1342 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, ?Credit for Installation of Alternative Fueling Stations,? provides for a tax credit of up to $30,000 to qualified alternative fueling properties that provide E85 ethanol and/or B20 bio-diesel.  Financial assistance grants may also be available from federal or non-governmental organizations.  This is provided as additional information only, and does not constitute a commitment to provide or offer financial assistance.  

Please forward your capability statements to:

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) #1
Date:  16 November 2006


THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.

GENERAL INFORMATION.  The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), Brooks City-Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A&E) firms to perform worldwide Title I, Title II, and other A&E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Family Housing (MFH), Military Construction (MILCON), and Sustainment, Restoration and Maintenance (SRM) programs of interest to the government.  We anticipate multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts using NAICS code 562910.  The small business size standard associated with this NAICS code is 500 employees.    We currently anticipate awarding approximately 15-20 contracts to large and small businesses.  All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase.  At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Time & Materials (T&M) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) depending on the nature of the requirement.  Additionally, we currently anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with three additional years for performance.  Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov).

BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION.  These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace and expand services contained within AFCEE?s existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E) contracts whose current ordering period will expire during the Jan - Jun 2008 timeframe.  In general, the existing 4P A-E SOW scope remains applicable to services contemplated for the future.  However, scope modifications are contemplated in the following areas:
	
?	Expanded MFH Title I and II Services
?	Expanded MILCON Title I and II Services
?	New/expanded SRM Title I and II Services
?	Continued General Information Management System Support Services (however, will eliminate procurement of Information Technology Systems)

ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF SERVICES
To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for environmental and traditional (Housing, MILCON, and SRM) projects.  The anticipated scope includes support in the following existing and emerging program areas:

?	Title I Services:  Title I services include all aspects of design such as preparation and/or review of contract plans, specifications, scheduling, cost estimates, building commissioning services and preparation of operating and design manuals.  Title I efforts also encompass those efforts required to support and develop design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, studies, investigations, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, and operation, monitoring, topographic survey services, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems
 
?	Title II Services:  Title II services include all aspects of construction quality assurance and oversight of environmental and facility construction projects

?	Environmental Restoration:  Support the Environmental Restoration mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support for remedial investigation, remedial design, long-term maintenance operations, and long-term monitoring (LTM). Interim remedial actions (IRAs) may be infrequently required to reduce or limit an immediate threat to human health or the environment.   In addition, support includes technical oversight of environmental programs, laboratory quality assurance assessments, document reviews, and assistance in selecting remediation technologies

?	Environmental Conservation and Planning:  Support the Environmental Conservation and Planning mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support on the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), natural infrastructure assessment and management, environmental management, natural and cultural resource programs, and comprehensive planning programs.  In addition, support environmental impact statements, baseline surveys, forestry, wildlife, archeology, Native American consultations, transportation, air space and range management, and noise programs

?	Environmental Quality:  Support the Environmental Quality mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support for compliance and pollution-prevention programs, environmental education and training, sustainable development, environmental management systems, and the Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP) 

?	Design and Construction:  Support the Design and Construction mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support related to standards, criteria and publications development, facility design, construction management, building commissioning, LEED analysis, interior design, landscape architecture, the Military Family Housing (MFH) and MFH Privatization program.  Also, support the development, testing, and documentation of new project management acquisition and construction methodologies   

?	Plans and Programs:  Major activities may include A&E support for defining housing market areas, detailed market research and analysis, development of housing requirements, pre-planning studies, detailed inspections and assessments of existing family housing and dormitories, development of programming guides for project scoping and the development of housing and dormitory investment strategies that integrate and prioritize, traditional housing construction and operations and maintenance (O&M) funding with private sector financing  

?	Other Areas of Support and Emerging Markets:  Support AFCEE with other areas of support and emerging markets.  Additional activities may include A&E support on Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) fuel facilities, unexploded ordnance (UXO), force protection, sustainable design, general information management system support services, and project delivery methods 

The final decision for inclusion of any requirements has not been made.

1.	Would you be interested in submitting a proposal considering the anticipated scope of work items?  If not, why?

2.	In reference to 1 above, do you have sufficient experience in the anticipated scope items that would allow the evaluator to assess your capability?  If not, please explain.

4.	What maximum capacity of work can your firm reasonably manage while assuring effective program/project implementation and maintaining quality products?

6.	 If you are a small business, would you consider submitting a proposal as a prime contractor?

7.	In what socio-economic programs do you now participate (e.g. Mentor Prot?g?, Indian Incentive, etc.)?  What is the extent of your participation in these programs?

8.	What are the most critical criteria that would distinguish one company?s capabilities from another?  Explain

For small business consideration, would your firm be able to compete under NAICS 562910?  If not, why? Please provide your recommendations concerning the anticipated number of contract awards, how many contracts should be reserved for small business, and the proposed NAICS. 

13.	If the Government were to contemplate splitting these A&E service requirements into two suites of IDIQ contracts (one covering environmental A&E services and one covering housing, MILCON, and SRM Title I and II services), what are your thoughts and/or concerns?

14.	For Market Research purposes, we are planning to host an Industry Forum.  What format do you think would be most beneficial for this Forum, what topics would you like to hear discussed, and what number of people would you envision sending?

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

   "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percentí for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
     
   "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

   "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

    (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

      (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

      (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and

  ìPerson", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

    (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

  (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 (b)(1). 

    (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
                                                                                  
  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 (b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesterís concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencyís goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Quotes (RFQ) number is NB847000703868DT.  The proposed procurement is a Total Small Business set aside.  NAICS Code:  334516.  Small Business Size Standard: 500 Employees. 

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Ion Storage Group requires a sensitive camera to image the low-light level fluorescence from trapped ions. As the number of ions in this work can be very small (even as small as a single ion), a camera with extreme low light level capabilities (essentially photon counting sensitivity) is required. Because the camera will also be used for laser beam set-up and alignment, it must have a variable gain and be able to withstand occasional strong signals without damage to the camera.  The NIST work requires high resolution (less than 20 micrometer pixels).  These requirements are met by an electron multiplication CCD (EMCCD) camera using an E2V Technologies EMCCD chip. Photon counting sensitivity on essentially no background requires cooling the chip to below -80 degrees C. The laser induced fluorescence we are detecting is in the ultraviolet region (UV) of the spectrum (3 13 nm and 280 nm).  Therefore NIST requires a back illuminated chip with a UV sensitive coating with an overall effective quantum efficiency of 35 % or greater at these wavelengths.  Additional requirements for the camera include:  minimum of 512 x 512 pixels, less than -80 degrees C thermoelectric cooling with forced ambient (@ 20 C) air, UV grade fused silica window with UVAR coating on both sides, integrated mechanical shutter, choice of at least 5 and 10 MHz pixel read out rates with the EMCCD amplifier, minimum of a 1 MHz pixel read out rate with a traditional amplifier, less than 0.005 spurious events/pixel/frame with the 10 MHz EMCCD read out rate, software for controlling the camera with a PC.

The required delivery is within 70 calendar days after receipt of order and shall be made F.O. B. Destination to NIST, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305.  Award will be made based on price (provided that the quoted equipment meets the requirements of this RFQ). Documentation that the camera meets the above specifications must be supplied and will be used only to determine product compliance with the Government's requirements. This can be done through a company data sheet or specification sheet.
Technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by fax or by e-mail.  You may submit your quote by e-mail, fax, or by mail.  Quotes must be received on or before close of business January 19, 2007. Notwithstanding responses received--it is at the discretion of the government to add additional sources and/or consider other quotes received after close of due date if it is in the best interest of the Government.  Please include delivery schedule, business size, and Dun and Bradstreet Number.  Vendors must also be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial, applies to this acquisition;  FAR 52.212-3,  Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items--Offerors must include a completed copy of Offeror Representations and Certifications along with the offer;  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.
