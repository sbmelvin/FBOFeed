<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME). <br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the of the Biochemistry and Biophysics Center Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics (NHLBI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis without providing for full and open competition to Bruker BioSpin Corp, 15 Fortune Drive, Billerica, MA 01821 to procure a service agreement.<br /><br />Procurement:<br />Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>Service personnel must carry out preventive maintenance on a regular schedule and will be available on very short notice should any malfunction occur.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform preventative maintenance on the CryoPlatform and cryoprobes at least once/year. Further, the contractor shall ensure that a service engineer arrives on site in a timely manner after a service request is made. The response time will be 48 - 72 hours after the service request is made. After preventative maintenance or after a repair is effected, the contractor shall demonstrate that all CryoPlatform and cryoprobes vacuum and temperature specifications are met and maintained.<br />The equipment to be service is as follows:<br />&bull; System ID - BH046804, AV SingleBay 2 Channel 600<br />&bull; Coverage Options - CryoPlatform w/annual maintenance<br />&bull; Probes Accessories - CP TXI 600S3 H-C/N-D-05Z S/NZ44866/00084</p>
<p>Period of performance <br />Service will commence upon receipt of purchase order ending on 8/31/2013.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) provides global leadership for a research, training, and education program to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.</p>
<p>The mission of the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) is to perform robust scientific and clinical research leading to a better understanding of biology and clinical pathology. To attain this goal, we have built a strong basic science foundation and coupled it closely with innovative technology development and outstanding clinical research both at the NIH Clinical Center and in partnership with local hospitals</p>
<p>A 600 MHz NMR spectrometer located in Bldg. 50, Room B204 employs a CryoPlatform and cryoprobes operating near liquid Helium temperatures. The CryoPlatform cools the cryoprobes used to detect NMR resonances with optimum sensitivity. This equipment is highly sophisticated and needs to be optimally maintained and tested on a defined schedule. The cold head, which is used to actually cool Helium, needs to be cleaned and overhauled at regular intervals. This spectrometer is a primary instrument used in the research of all members of the Structural Biophysics Section of the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics and access to this NMR spectrometer is crucial for the Section to fulfill its mission to develop and apply NMR techniques to study relevant biological problems.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objective:<br />The purpose of this requirement is to procure a twelve month service contract for the Cryo-probes. The service contract is designed to ensure that there is no disruption in the used of the spectrometer, a critical research instrument in the Laboratory.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities:<br />The Government will ensure that the site including the CryoPlatform, cryoprobes and attached computer are made fully available to the eservice engineer upon approval at NIH.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables<br />The plates must provide all reports and deliverables as indicated in the contractor requirements.</p>
<p>Program Management and Control Requirements<br />The Section of Inflammation and Cardiometabolic Diseases' technician will oversee the use of the plates. If there are any issues the technician will contact the company.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements<br />Inspection and acceptance will be performed at the NIH/NHLBI Section of Inflammation and Cardiometabolic Diseases, located in building 10, 7N116, Bethesda, MD 20892.</p>
<p>If there is significant damage to the packaging, representing deep penetration or water damage, or if there is evidence of tampering with the contents, then the shipment should be rejected. The technician or his/her designee will communicate this decision to the sales representative of the vendor.</p>
<p>The plates will be inspected and accepted by a Section of Inflammation and Cardiometabolic Diseases' technician. They will ensure that the plates are appropriate and in good working order. They should address any questions or concern with the head of the Section of Inflammation and Cardiometabolic Diseases and with the vendor.</p>

<DESC>Veterans Benefits Administration Initial Development Industry Day
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) requests the attendance of interested firms at an industry day to be held on September 6, 2013 in Washington, DC to discuss potential solutions to address its Initial Development challenge.  At the industry day, VBA will provide detailed information about the requirement and will ask attendees to provide feedback on the challenge and information on industry capabilities that could address it.  
Initial Development is a component of VBA's disability compensation claims process where VBA employees review disability compensation claims that have been submitted, determine what documentation and information (what VBA calls claims evidence) is necessary to substantiate the claim and prove eligibility for benefits and then send out initial requests for that evidence.  VBA's target time for the completion of Initial Development is less than 13 calendar days after VBA staff entered the claim into VBA's software systems.  Currently, VBA completes Initial Development in an average of 109 calendar days for rating-related disability claims.  VBA is looking for completely integrated (with existing VBA business processes/systems), end to end (no VBA steps in the process) industry solutions to efficiently perform Initial Development at or faster than its 13 calendar day target.  Effective solutions will enable VBA to speed its processing of claims by reducing the total days of claims processing time and will help VBA address its backlog by allowing the reallocation of staff effort expended on Initial Development to other tasks in the claims process.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)</p>

DON policy prescribes that all unclassified data that has not been approved for public release and is stored on mobile computing devises must be treated as sensitive data and encrypted using commercially available encryption technology. Whenever granted access to sensitive information, contractor employees shall follow applicable DoD/DoN instructions, regulations, policies and procedures when reviewing, processing, producing, protecting, destroying and/or storing that information. Operational Security (OPSEC) procedures and practices must be implemented by both the contractor and contract employee to protect the product, information, services, operations and missions related to the contract. The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the Navy Command's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Non-Sensitive Positions<br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the US (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions<br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards<br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed NACI.</p>
<p>The Contractor's Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />Sensitive Positions <br />Contractor employee whose duties require accessing a DoD unclassified computer/network, working with sensitive unclassified information (either at a Government or contractor facility), or physical access to a DoD facility must be a US citizen and possess a favorable trustworthiness determination prior to installation access. To obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination, each contractor employee must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Credit Checks (NACLC) which consists of a NACI including a FBI fingerprint check plus credit and law enforcement checks. Each contractor employee applying for a trustworthiness determination is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-85P Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions<br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards<br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. To maintain continuing authorization for an employee to access a DoD unclassified computer/network, and/or have access to sensitive unclassified information, the contractor shall ensure that the individual employee has a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required and ensuring that background investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period.</p>
<p>IT Systems Access<br />When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />Security Approval Process<br />The Contractor's Security Representative shall ensure that each individual employee pending assignment shall accurately complete the required forms for submission to the Navy Command's Security Manager. The Contractor's Security Representative shall screen the investigative questionnaires for completeness and accuracy and for potential suitability/security issues prior to submitting the request to the Navy Command's Security Manager. Forms and fingerprint cards may be obtained from the Navy Command's Security Manager. These required items, shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager for processing at least 30 days prior to the individual employee's anticipated date for reporting for duty. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy Command's Security Manager may render the contract employee ineligible for the assignment. A favorable review of the questionnaire and advance fingerprint results are required as an interim measure prior to the contract employee start date. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy Command's Security Manager is final and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract.</p>
<p>If contractor employees already possess a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the Navy Command's Security Manager will use the Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a position of trust determination. When a favorable determination is not made, contractor employees shall not be permitted to work on this contract effort and if already working on the contract shall be removed immediately.</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirements under this clause including denial of access for a proposed contractor employee who fails to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees for working in non-sensitive positions, with sensitive information, and/or on Government IT systems. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have physical access to a federally controlled facility and/or access to a federally-controlled information system/network and/or access to government information.</p>

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.

(b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

Furthermore, due to the nature of the activity &ndash; where the level of technical assistance, training and grants provision cannot be fully disclosed or determined at the time of award and will be dependent on the need &ndash; the scope of work is considered to be relatively general and thus, the contractor will be required to provide a level of effort for the stated time period, making a term-type contract more appropriate than a completion-type contract (FAR 16.306(d)(2)).</span><br />
