New DOD requirements for wood packaging material (WPM) have been developed in response to international implementation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization protocol on International Standards for Phytosanitary 
Measures (ISPM) 15. ISPM 15 is designed to block movement of pests that can destroy forests from one nation to another. DOD shipments inside and outside of the United States must meet ISPM 15 whenever WPM is used to ship DOD cargo. (For more information, see the American Lumber Standard Committee, Incorporated Web page at http://www.alsc.org.) The new WPM requirements will be reflected in DLA solicitations and awards issued on or after August 1, 2006. WPM is defined in the clause at DLAD 52.247-9012, Requirements for Treatment of Wood Packaging Material. (Note that DOD does not endorse the Methyl Bromide Fumigation Program. Only heat treatment or kiln dried heat treatment of WPM are authorized.) After August 1, 2006, contractors can be held accountable for taking corrective action on noncompliant shipments.

This will be your only means of obtaining the solicitation/award. All contractors with access to the internet and an e-mail address can receive electronic notifications of award. CAUTION: This solicitation has been issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Thus, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidder's mailing list. It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for proposal receipts may render your offer non-responsive and result in the rejection of same. All prospective contractors are required to submit or upload their organizations representation and certifications at https://orca.bpn.gov prior to submitting your offer, failure to do so will render your offer non-responsive. In order to register with ORCA you need three things. An active CCR registration, DUNS number, and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN). It takes your CCR registration 24-48 hours after submission to completely activate, during which you will be unable to log in to ORCA.   Your Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) is a 9-digit code containing at least one alpha character and one number (no special characters or spaces). The MPIN is created, by you, in your company's CCR record and acts as a password for other various government systems.  To view or edit your MPIN, go to www.ccr.gov and click on "Update or Renew Registration" from the left side of the page.  From this page choose which of the three options fit with your company and then click on the "Continue" link.  Now you are shown a page which has two text boxes for your CCR Username and Password.   The CCR Username and Password is needed to access CCR. The CCR Point of Contact should have this information. If you do not know your company's CCR Point of Contact or if you are the CCR POC and have forgotten the password contact the CCR Assistance Center at 888-227-2423 - they can help you.                        Enter your DUNS number and MPIN into their correct text boxes and click on the "log in" button.  Once in your registration look to the box on the left where you will see a number of categories in bold letters- click on "Points of Contact."  When that page comes up, scroll down to the bottom to "MPIN." You are able to view or edit your MPIN. If you create a new MPIN, it will be activated immediately in ORCA.                                                                                                                          To register, begin by logging in to ORCA (https://orca.bpn.gov) using your DUNS # and MPIN, and you will be brought to a page that displays your CCR information. Click the button "Create ORCA Record" or "Update Your Partially Completed Record". You will be brought to a page where you can enter information for an ORCA point of contact. After filling out this information click "Continue". This will bring you to the ORCA questionnaire.  All questions must be answered to continue through the 5 pages of ORCA questionnaire.  Successful completion of the questionnaire will bring you to the Representations and Certifications page.  Answer the read only provisions (there are either 4 or 13 depending on your reps and certs (FAR - 5, DFARS - 9)) and then at the very bottom check the box located with the time and date stamp that is right above the submit certification box.

<DESC>RECOVERY – This notice is provided for Informational Purposes Only.  This opportunity is available only to the Contractor, Merrick and Company of Aurora, CO, under the existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract number SB1341-07-CQ-0016 
for Professional Engineering Services for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Center for Neutron Research (NCNR).  

NIST is seeking a proposal for the manufacture of tooling and fixtures for the prototype of a shim safety rod for the NIST/Center for Neutron Research.  The period of performance of the task order shall be six months from the date of award.

This notice is issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  This project shall be funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

The estimated price range of the requirement is between $825,000 and $850,000.00.

It is the intent of the NIST Acquisition Management Division to award a firm-fixed price task order.

Description of Services
The National Institute of Standards and Technology, Center for Neutron Research owns and operates a 20 MW Test Reactor. 

Among the main safety related components of the reactor are shim safety rods (SSRs).  The function of the shim safety rods is to regulate and control the nuclear reaction.  The operational part of the SSR is a sheet of cadmium metal (a neutron absorber) that is captured between two concentric aluminum cylinders in such a way that no cadmium can be in contact with the outside world. These cylinders do not have a circular cross-section.  Their cross-section is better described as “oval” or, even better, as “race-track”.
 
Cadmium SSRs rods are consumables.  As SSRs perform their function as control rods, the cadmium slowly “burns up” (which means, during use, the cadmium isotope that performs the control function is slowly replaced by another cadmium isotope that cannot be used to control the reactor).  This dynamic means that the shim safety rods need to be replaced in a timeline of, approximately, every 4 years.
 
Work required under this task order will result in the delivery of all tooling and fixtures for a prototype of a shim safety rod.  The Contractor will also further update some procedures and protocols based on theories established, but not tested, under the first task order.  Testing will be completed in conjunction with the fabrication of the prototype.

Work under this task order is follow-on work to a task order awarded in September of 2008, and completed in January of 2009. 

Work under that task order provided revisions and updates to the existing quality assurance plan, and formal procedures and assemblies that will, ultimately, be utilized in the fabrication of shim safety rods for the reactor. These documents were provided as Government Furnished Information for update and revision by the Contractor.

<DESC>RECOVERY - The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Specialty Center Acquisitions, NAVFAC (SCAN), Port Hueneme, CA intends to competitively solicit and award a firm-fixed priced single award contract on an unrestricted basis utilizing Recovery Act of 2009 funding. The work to be performed includes RDT&E services in support of the NAVFAC Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) Project.  The project's intent is to advance the development and commercialization of OTEC technology for Navy applications so as to reduce dependence on fossil fuels at bases located in tropical areas, including Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia (NSFDG), and Navy facilities in Hawaii, and Guam. The Navy conducted a one-day OTEC Industry Forum event on May 19, 2009 to allow OTEC developers to offer their views on how best to facilitate commercialization of the OTEC technology and mitigate risk during development.  OTEC developers identified technologies and a variety of components they considere! d high risk and discussed strategies for system commercialization. Input from this one-day event was used to further define this requirement which includes component/subsystem design and testing, system design, OTEC commercialization and risk mitigation plans which may lead to a future validated OTEC facility design.  The estimated period of performance is one year.  NAICS 541712 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees. Scope and tasking associated with this effort is expected to be transferable to future Navy OTEC projects such as site specific OTEC system designs, fabrication, installations, associated NEPA environmental permitting documentation and processes, OTEC pilot plant efforts, and separate long-term utility purchase agreements from OTEC systems at Navy locations.  Offerors can view and/or download the solicitation at https://www.neco.navy.mil/ when it becomes available. Proposed solicitation number is N62583-09-R-0083, expected issue date is ! 6/15/2009. Award is anticipated on or before 9/15/2009.  Contact Janet Harouch at 805-982-5079 or e-mail at janet.harouch@navy.mil for additional information.

<DESC>The Department of State intends to use other than full and open competition to procure variants of the Sikorsky Aerospace S-61 Helicopter, spare and repair parts, pilot and mechanic training, ground support equipment, technical services, and special tooling to support INL/A’s aviation program for the next five years.

S-61	Option Year 4	3 	 	 	 
 	Total	                      16	

2.	The resulting contract will be for up to 16 aircraft, spare and repair parts, pilot and mechanic training, ground support equipment, and special tooling and test equipment, and technical services.  The contract will have a basic quantity of four aircraft and optional quantities outlined above over a five year period of performance.  The optional quantity of aircraft will be for aircraft attrition and/or increased aviation capacity.  The contract shall also have task order provisions to order required S-61 supplies and services.

3.	The medium-lift rotary-wing aircraft perform a variety of missions. At times the aircraft operate from forward operating base locations under primitive conditions and at other times from international airports executing instrument approaches. The primary mission is to transport passengers and cargo into and out of austere field sites located throughout the theater of operation, Afghanistan, in support of the US Embassy. This mission requires that the aircraft have good personnel and cargo carrying capacity, long range and flight endurance. Operations are often flown in very rugged, high mountainous terrain that requires optimum take off, climb, and turn performance at high and high-density altitudes. These aircraft will serve in remote areas with few bases from which to operate aircraft. 
Secondary missions included, but are not limited to, force protection, convoy escort, hostile force reconnaissance, quick-reaction-force (QRF) movement and support, external load, and medical evacuation. Further, the aircraft and crews are subject to being targeted by hostile fire. These aircraft will require defensive aircrew and aircraft survivability systems to be installed.  Due to the austere operating environment, aircraft mission availability requirements, and airworthiness, the aircraft must be manufactured in the United States and have a long term readily available source of OEM approved / certified spare parts.  The aircraft must be certified and supported by the original equipment manufacturer for spares, technical data and publications, engineering, Safety of Flight, and airworthiness and meet the following mission requirements:
1. Mission service definition:
a. Service ceiling – 13,000 feet MSL
b. Originating and terminating from a 7000 foot Density altitude condition, the aircraft performance must meet or exceed the following:
i. Available Cargo Load – 4500 pounds (15 passengers or cargo or combination of passengers and cargo totaling 4500 pounds).
ii. Departure fuel load allows a 200 NM round trip before refueling with a 20 minute fuel reserve.
2. Aircraft certified to land at maximum authorized gross weight.
3. Minimum fuel endurance of 2 hours.
4. Maintain a minimum 100 KTAS cruise.
5. Aircraft will be required to perform over rough mountainous terrain typical of Afghanistan, at elevations that vary from sea level to 14,000 feet MSL.  Temperatures can range from 20 degrees C below ISA at 8,500 feet MSL to 20 degrees C above ISA at 6,000 feet MSL.  

4.	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.

5.	Sikorsky Aerospace is the only manufacture and only source of the S-61 Helicopter.  Sikorsky Aerospace owns and controls all technical data associated with the S-61 Helicopter.

6.                  INL/A contracted with the independent firm of Conklin and de Decker to perform an A-76 study for aviation assets operating in the Near East.  The results of the study (INL/A revision 1) indicated that six rotary aircraft met the INL/A mission objectives, specifically, the Sikorsky variants of the S-61 (with composite rotary blades), the Sikorsky S-70 Blackhawk, the Boeing CH-47 / BV 234, the Eurocopter AS332L1, the Sikorsky S92 and the Eastern European MI-17.  All of the Sikorsky products are built in the United States and supported by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The price for the S-70 and the S-92 aircraft exceeds available funding and, moreover, the aircraft are not available until 2011.  Used S-70 and S92 aircraft are not available.  The Boeing CH-47 and the Eurocopter AS332L1 both exceed available funding for both the new and used aircraft and are not available.  The MI-17 is not supported by a US OEM manufacture, is built outside the US, and although very popular in the theater of operation, there is serious concern with obtaining airworthy spare and repair parts to support the MI-17. Procurement of new MI-17 aircraft is outside of INL/A funding availability and like the spare and repair parts, airworthiness of used MI-17s are suspect.  Consequently, variants of the S-61 are the only available aircraft that meets aircraft capability, funding, and availability requirements to perform the INL/A aviation support mission.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The building must be located outside of any 100-year floodplain.  Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current Federal, State, and Local codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, accessibility, and OSHA.

<DESC>This is a competitive combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation No. DTRT57-09-Q-80061 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5 and FAR Part 12.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. A written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order on a competitive basis.  The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement to purchase Presentation Skills Training.  
STATEMENT OF WORK (BEGIN)
I. PURPOSE: The purpose of this core competency training is to enable the Volpe Center (The Center) staff to develop fundamental presentation skills that will enable them to prepare and present technical and/or professional data/information to a variety of audiences.  II. BACKGROUND: An innovative Federal fee-for-service organization, the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), part of the U.S. DOTs Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), is an internationally recognized center of transportation and logistics expertise. The Volpe team represents a world class transportation resource with multidisciplinary capabilities in all modes of transportation. The Volpe Center plays a unique role in looking across the transportation enterprise to anticipate future transportation issues and challenges.  The Volpe Center is organized into eight Centers of Innovation (COI). Each COI applies its technical capabilities to U.S. DOT strategic goals and national transportation priorities. The COIs expand U.S. DOT's multimodal horizons and demonstrate how innovation can arise from creative and collaborative use of internal and external assets. The Center, as part of RITA, provides research, analysis and systems capability to DOT and other agencies requiring expertise in national transportation and logistics programs.  The Center's staff at the Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA complex consists of about 550 Federal employees of which 35 are managers.  The Center's professional staff represents a wide range of disciplines, including nearly all areas of engineering, and the physical, social and managerial sciences.  The primary professional or educational background of the staff is information systems or engineering.  The majority of the Federal professional staff holds graduate degrees and possess at least 5 years of professional experience in their chosen field.  III. TASKS: TASK 1.  The Contractor will provide Center staff with one two-day training event on Presentation Skills for up to 15 attendees per event.  In addition, there will be options to conduct two sessions per fiscal year thereafter for a maximum of seven sessions between July 2009 and the end of September 2012.  A session may be cancelled if there is an insufficient number of attendees (fewer than 10) to make the event cost effective.  The cancellation notice will be given to the Contractor 14 calendar days in advance of the scheduled class.  TASK 2. The Contractor will structure a training event that provides attendees with concepts and techniques on the fundamentals of developing, preparing, and delivering effective presentations to persuade as well as inform the audience. Training will emphasize presentation skills and include assessing the audience; scoping and sizing the material; presenting data and technical results; constructing a clear, logical flow; providing readable, concise visual aids; and responding to audience questions.   TASK 3. The Contractor will evaluate and provide feedback to each trainee on her/his presentation skills and style. TASK 4. The Contractor will provide all course materials, e.g., handouts, transparencies and other instructional aides, necessary to reinforce the learning.  IV. QUALIFICATIONS: At a minimum, the Instructor(s) must possess a bachelor's degree and five (5) years of experience in training professionals to develop and to present technical or scientific data.  The degree requirement may be waived if the Instructor(s) possesses five additional years of experience.  Evidence of effectiveness in relevant presentation skills training and a sample of proposed training materials must be provided.  V. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS: The Government will provide the following: The classroom facility in which to present the course; podium, flipcharts, overhead projector, projection screen, and markers; pens, pencils and paper for participants; and course evaluation forms in sufficient quantities for all attendees at the completion of the course.  VI. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The first training event will be accomplished by September 2009.  The period of performance will extend through September 30, 2012.  VII. DELIVERABLES AND DUE DATES: SEE ATTACHED TABLE.  STATEMENT OF WORK (END)
TECHNICAL CRITERIA: The Contractor's technical proposal should include evidence of the following minimum qualifications: CORPORATE EXPERIENCE: The Contractor will have the resources to provide presentation skills training to an audience consisting primarily of engineers and information technology professionals.   The course curriculum will include the required training and activities described in paragraph III of the Statement of Work.  The Contractor shall provide at a minimum two relevant references/past performance reports for similar training conducted within the last two years.  
STAFFING REQUIREMENTS: The Instructor(s) must possess a minimum of a bachelor's degree and five (5) years experience in training engineers and information technology professionals to effectively present technical information in the business environment.   The educational requirement may be waived if the Instructor possesses an additional five (5) years of experience teaching presentation skills.  PAST PERFORMANCE: If the Contractor has performed work in the past for the Volpe Center, that performance will be considered when determining the capability to perform the work.  METHODOLOGY: The Contractor will describe in writing and in sufficient detail the approach to be used in presenting the training.  A sample agenda for the two day class shall be provided.  Course materials from recent, similar presentation skills classes the Contractor has conducted will be acceptable. The failure to fully articulate the approach to be used may result in the Contractor being considered ineligible.
BASIS OF AWARD: Award will be made to the responsive and responsible Offerors whose offers provide the best value to the Government based on the Technical Proposal, and Price.
ORDER OF IMPORTANCE:  The technical evaluation factors in the Technical Proposal are of equal importance (Technical merit, Relevant past performance experience, Instructor's qualifications, and Learning approach), when combined, are significantly more important than cost in the selection of a contractor for award.  Notwithstanding this fact, Offerors are cautioned not to minimize the importance of the Price Proposal. As the difference in technical ratings of submitted Technical Proposals decreases, the importance of price will increase. When the Technical Proposals are evaluated as essentially equal, price may become the determining factor in making an award.
Price proposal for each CLIN shall include all labor, materials and travel-related expenses including lodging necessary to conduct the class(es).  The items are as follows:  CLIN 0001-Course Development for Presentation Skills Training, 1 EA $__________; CLIN 0002-Two Day training course in Presentation Skills, (July 2009) 1 EA $__________; CLIN 0003-Option 1, Two Day training course in Presentation Skills, (November 2009) 1 EA, $__________; CLIN 0004-Option 2, Two Day training course in Presentation Skills, (March 2010), 1 EA, $__________; CLIN 0005-Option 3, Two Day training course in Presentation Skills, (November 2010), 1 EA, $__________; CLIN 0006-Option 4, Two Day training course in Presentation Skills, (March 15, 2011), 1 EA, $__________; CLIN 0007-Option 5, Two Day training course in Presentation Skills, (November 2011), 1 EA, $__________; CLIN 0008-Option 6, Two Day training course in Presentation Skills, (March 2012), 1 EA, $__________; Total for CLINS 0001-0008: $__________.

The panel will be provided to the San Antonio Air Logistics Center for modification and installation on the remotes in inventory.  Once the installation is completed, the remotes will be shipped to the C-130J bases.Part number for panel required is ON460513-8.

<DESC>FDA Animal Husbandry and Research Support

This is a Sources Sought notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. 

Background

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has three Centers which maintain an on-site animal research program in support of regulatory activities.    Animal based research performed by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) conducts research on the safety, efficacy, metabolism and other aspects of mechanism and effects of pharmaceuticals.  The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) conducts research to observe and measure the individual and additive, short and long range effects of finished device products and the materials contained in these devices such as latex, heavy metals, toxins and radiation.  The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) program focuses on the research and development of standards on the safety, composition, and quality of foods, food additives, color additives, and cosmetics.  The Center for Biological Evaluation and Research (CBER) plans and conducts research related to the development, manufacture, testing, and use of both new and old biological products to develop a scientific base for establishing standards designed to ensure the continued safety, purity, potency, and efficacy of biological products.   Animal based research performed by both CDER and CDRH is managed and located in Silver Spring, Maryland.  This facility houses laboratory animals, primarily rodents and rabbits, and on occasion either dogs or miniature pigs in an environmentally controlled animal facility that utilizes a single corridor system.  Animal based research performed by CFSAN is conducted in Laurel, MD and houses laboratory animals, primarily rodents, in an environmentally controlled animal facility that utilizes a clean/dirty corridor system.  Animal based research performed by CBER is conducted at two facilities, one in Bethesda, Maryland and one in Kensington, Maryland.  These facilities house laboratory animals, primarily rodents, guinea pigs, rabbits, ferrets, primates and frogs in environmentally controlled animal facilities.

Statement of Need

The FDA requires animal husbandry services including but not limited to washing animal cages, providing feed, water and bedding, maintaining a clean environment, observing animals for general health and well-being, providing skilled technical and health surveillance support and carrying out environmental parameter checks of the facility.

The approximate number of animals under study at each location is:  White Oak has an average weekly census of 500 rodents, up to 8 rabbits and up to 4 dogs or minipigs; CFSAN maintains 7,000 to 8,000 rodents and 300 to 350 ferrets/rabbits; and CBER maintains on average 60,000 – 70,000 mice and rats, 700 guinea pigs, 800 hamsters, 100 rabbits, 30 ferrets, one room of frogs and 250 nonhuman primates.  FDA has a need for a contractor to provide technical services in support of approved protocols for animal studies associated with, but not limited to the use of rats, mice, rabbits, and other species of small laboratory animals.  Animal husbandry services are needed to support experimental procedures that include but are not limited to administration of substances by subcutaneous, intravenous or intraperitioneal injections, gavaging, and collections of tissues and body fluids.  The specialized technical support required includes but is not limited to the use and cleaning of metabolism caging.  The number of dose groups, the concentration(s), volume and methods of administration and housing specifications are dictated by the experimental protocol and design.

Statement of Work

1.1	Background: Single Family Mortgage Insurance Program

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an organizational unit within HUD, administers the single-family mortgage insurance program.  FHA insures approved lenders against the risk of loss on loans they finance for the purchase or rehabilitation of single-family homes.  In the event of a default on an FHA insured loan the lender acquires title to the property by foreclosure, a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or other acquisition method, files a claim for insurance benefits and conveys the property to HUD.  As a result of acquisitions through the mortgage insurance program and other programs, HUD has a need to manage and sell a sizable inventory of single-family homes in a manner that promotes home ownership, preserves communities, and maximizes return to the FHA insurance funds.  Managing REO properties, HUD requires the services of Property Tax Service Vendor (referred to as “Vendor” hereafter) to perform all necessary tax research activities and delivery all available data on its behalf.

1.1.1	Interaction/Impact:  Performance under this contract will involve interaction with HUD staff and the HUD Business Service Provider (referred to as “BSP” hereafter).  Additionally, this contract may be impacted by changes in government regulation, legislation or housing policy initiatives.

<p>The approved methods for analyzing these products are (AOAC) 991.31 and 998.03 which require the use of standards to correctly identify and quantify aflatoxins found in commodities analyzed by the laboratories. These methods are published by AOAC and are available for purchase from them.</p>
<p><br />The aflatoxin standards used for these analyses will be manufactured by Sigma (Supelco) on an as needed basis for the laboratories. B1, B2, G1 and G2 are the standards used in the analysis for the presence of aflatoxin. Sigma manufactures the standards B1, B2, G1 and G2 in a mix of methanol or benzene. The composition of these standards are specified in the AOAC methods used in the analyses. The source of these standards must remain the same because of tracking and requirements based on the ISO 17025 accreditation that is held for methods utilizing these standards.</p>
<p>The exact date of award for the base period and number of option years is yet to be determined.</p>

<DESC>A.  General Information.  

The Northeast Region (TRBO Reg. 1), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 47 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia including institutional and operational healthcare settings announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of SAFETY SCALPELS AND BLADES.   This product line consists of sterile, disposable and safety engineered scalpels with blades that are round-tipped and/or retractable; quick-release and/or shielded; separate and/or attached blades to handles; scalpel handles of various lengths and sizes with handles that must have a slip-resistant feature.  Also included in this product line are carbon steel and stainless steel blades and disposable blade handles that are flash/steam autoclavable.  At a minimum vendors are required to supply the surgical blades listed in the sizes listed below.
1.	Safety blade, rib-back, carbon steel, disposable, sterile, individually packaged, 10
2.	Safety scalpel, disposable, sterile, #10
3.	Safety scalpel, disposable, sterile, #11
4.	Non-safety blade, disposable, sterile, #15
5.	Non-safety blade, rib-back, carbon steel, disposable, sterile, #15 and #11
6.	Non-safety blade, 2.5mm, 60 degree, bevel down, disposable, sterile
7.	Non-safety blade, disposable, non-sterile, #10
8.	Non-safety blade, disposable, non-sterile, #11

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit’s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC), National Naval Medical Center (Bethesda, MD), Malcolm Grow Medical Center (Andrews AFB, MD), Dewitt Healthcare System (FT Belvoir, VA), Keller Army Community Hospital (West Point, NY), and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (FT Meade, MD). 

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIA’s) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three one year (12 months) option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is August 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.    
Point of Contact: Toni Massenburg, (202) 782-3666, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil.  

B.  Products & Performance Required.  

The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of SAFETY SCALPELS AND BLADES, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $57,217.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.

At the request of the Northeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.

C. Instructions to Vendors.  

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Toni Massenburg, (202) 782-3666, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil or  Tracy Martin-Tilghman, (202) 782-3663, tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil as a back-up.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.

D.  Evaluation Criteria.  

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Northeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  

The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.  The TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s).  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  

Phase I – Technical/Company Evaluation Process:  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to toni.massenburg@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price proposed package discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  In general, “acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors’ responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of “technical acceptability.”  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:
1. Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Safety Scalpels & Blades products.  A ‘complete line of product’ is defined as the MTF’s requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  
a. At a minimum this product line consists of sterile, disposable and safety engineered scalpels with blades that are round-tipped and/or retractable; quick-release and/or shielded; separate and/or attached blades to handles; scalpel handles of various lengths and sizes with handles that must have a slip-resistant feature.  Also included in this product line are carbon steel and stainless steel blades and disposable blade handles that are flash/steam autoclavable.  At a minimum vendors are required to supply the surgical blades listed in the sizes listed below.
i.                  Safety blade, rib-back, carbon steel, disposable, sterile, individually packaged, #10
ii.	Safety scalpel, disposable, sterile, #10
iii.	Safety scalpel, disposable, sterile, #11
iv.	Non-safety blade, disposable, sterile, #15
v.	Non-safety blade, rib-back, carbon steel, disposable, sterile, #15 and #11
vi.	Non-safety blade, 2.5mm, 60 degree, bevel down, disposable, sterile
vii.	Non-safety blade, disposable, non-sterile, #10
viii.	Non-safety blade, disposable, non-sterile, #11
b. Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via catalog, and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).
2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Safety Scalpels & Blades product line.  Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  
3. Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for Safety Scalpels & Blades in the Northeast Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Vendor MUST provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. 
4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.
5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Safety Scalpels & Blades products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.    
6.	Vendor MUST provide Safety Scalpels and Blades systems that have safety features that are an integral part of the safety scalpels.  Vendors MUST identify their safety features of their products and provide literature to support this in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.    
7.   Vendor MUST provide latex safe/free products.  Vendor MUST provide list of all latex  
      safe/free items supplied such as catalogs, etc. in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.

Phase II Plan – Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:
Clinical/Performance Evaluations
1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the to the CPT members at participating Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs), and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the participating MTF address by COB, 5:00PM EST, (14) calendar days after the notice to ship.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the product samples by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  
2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor’s product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.
3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).
4.	To determine acceptability, the CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Northeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a clinical/patient care setting. 
5.	Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.  Vendor’s presence will be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations.  Vendors WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitor’s products.  
6.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or price–related factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or price–related factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process.

Clinical/Performance Criteria:  
1.	The CPT identified that the standards of care that the Northeast Region medical communities adhere to, specifically related to Safety Scalpels and Blades, are those that will be the basis for specific technical/company and clinical/performance criteria.  The standards are set forth by the following: 
a.	The Joint Commission - Requires compliance with "applicable law and regulation" standards in the Governance (GO.2.4) and the Management (MA.2) chapters, The Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act. 
b.	Federal Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act (PL 106-430), (November 6, 2000), which mandates revision of the 1991 OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to require the use of engineered sharps injury prevention devices.
c.	Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030) and its related field directive, Inspection Procedures for the Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (CPL 2-2.44, November 5, 1999) requiring use of engineered sharps injury prevention devices as a primary prevention strategy.  The standards are located in the guidance set forth by the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA’s) Directorate of Enforcement Programs (DEP) - 
i.	“bloodborne pathogens standards 29 CFR 1910.1030, “any contaminated object that can penetrate the skin, including but not limited to needles, scalpels, broken glass, broken capillary tubes, and exposed ends of dental wires,” 1910.1030 (b).
ii.	OSHA’s blood borne pathogens standard at 29 CFR 1910.1030 (c) (1) (iv) (B) requires employers to evaluate safer medical devices to eliminate/minimize employee exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM).
iii.	Solicit input from non-managerial employees in the election process [29 CFR 1910.1030 (c) (1) (v)].
iv.	Engineering controls, including safety scalpels, must be implemented where their use is feasible [29 CFR 1910.1030 (d) (2) (i)].


Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below:   

Safety Scalpel Blade System:
1.	The Safety Scalpel is ergonomically designed and comfortable to hold and use in either hand. 
a.	Determining safety scalpel products that are comfortably engineered by the surgical staff not only will increase the potential for the safety scalpels to be utilized but it will put to work controls that can effectively minimize the hazards of operating room injuries related to scalpels.  This also provides for the surgical staff to identify the products they will use so that the facility and region will be in compliance with the Joint Commission and OSHA’s requirements.  
b.	The evaluator will gently grip/hold the safety scalpel between the thumb and index fingers, while gently balancing the scalpel handle in the remainder of the fingers in the same hand.

2.	The safety feature of the Scalpel Blade System can be easily activated with one hand.  
a.	The safety feature must be able to be easily activated with one hand in order to decrease operating room sharp incidents while passing instrument hand-to-hand, as well as protect employees who may be at risk for getting injured by an unprotected device.    
b.	Per the manufacturer guidelines the evaluator is to grip/hold the safety scalpel between the thumb and index finger and release the safety mechanism as per manufacturer’s guidelines.   

3.	There is a clear and unmistakable change (audible / tactile / visible) that occurs when the safety feature is activated.  
a.	The safety mechanism must be in place to assure that it is locked and that there is no compromise to the technique of providing a safety scalpel when related to the locking device.  This will assist in minimizing potential sharp injuries in the operating room related to scalpels.
b.	The evaluator will activate the safety feature and hear, feel, and see a clear and unmistakable change or "clicks" that will help identify the blade's open and locked position. 

4.	The Safety Blade position is visible at all times on the sterile field. 
a.	This will reduce the risk of blade and scalpel injuries by allowing clinicians to focus first on the surgical site, rather than on the instrument. 
b.	The evaluator will have full visibility of the blade position at all times while on the sterile field to help reduce the risk of accidentally injury. 

Safety Scalpels with Handles
1.	Safety blade is easily mounted onto blade handle.  
a.	The Safety Blade System is easily assembled or mounted by grasping the protective shield with thumb and index finger with the blade tip pointing up. 
b.	The handle cleat is inserted into the scalpel blade until the blade is up to the indicator line.
c.	The handle allows for the retraction of the scalpel blade inside the handle before passing, which helps reduce the risk of sharps injuries.
d.	The slider activation allows for the touchless disposal of used blades into a needle counter box.
e.	The two-piece handle uses standard protocol for sterilization.
f.	While following manufacturers guidelines, the evaluator will mount the safety scalpel to the handle provided.  

2.	The scalpel handle slip-resistant feature provides a secure hold in surgical gloved hands, accommodating to a variety of hand positions.
a.	 The sure-grip sides on the handles allow for stable handling, preventing slippage, and allowing for easy loading, opening, and closing.
b.	The ability to hold the scalpel firm, yet gently enough to provide the delicate incisions of a traditional scalpel handle for surgeons’ increase not only their comfort in usage but also will assist in identifying a scalpel handle that meets their needs.  
c.	The evaluator will hold the scalpel handle as per manufacturer guidelines while wearing surgical gloves and feel the slip-resistant feature through the gloves to help prevent risk of injury during use, passing and disposal.

Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I – Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified/invited to provide their their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Northeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). 

The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three one year (12 months) option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendor’s products, and the products that could not be matched.  Specifically it reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing with the Non-Safety Scalpels and Blades converted to Safety Scalpels and Blades, including the current Safety Scalpels and Blades the region currently utilizes.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.   Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Northeast Region are considered more important than other pricing elements.

<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Developmental Planning Directorate (XR), Conventional Strike Missile (CSM) Project Office intends to modify the existing Payload Delivery Vehicle (PDV) contract, FA8814-08-C-0003, to add fabrication, delivery, and flight test support of a hypersonic payload delivery vehicle. This PDV will be manufactured in accordance with the Hypersonic Test Vehicle (HTV)-2 design developed for the FALCON program by Lockheed Martin and modified to accommodate a weapon. This vehicle must be ready for a 2012 flight demonstration. The modification for this effort will be issued to the incumbent contractor, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Valley Forge, PA.</p>
<p>The contractor will perform design modification, fabrication, delivery, and flight test support of a hypersonic payload delivery vehicle. The first two flights under the FALCON program will be used to qualify the payload delivery vehicle's structural design specifications, avionics, and flight software. The HTV-2 is under final assembly and scheduled to fly in CY2009.</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no qualified parties exist or can exist to meet project requirements other than Lockheed Martin. The basis for lack of competition is Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" due to unacceptable delays and duplication of costs.</p>
<p>This notice is for information purposes only and the Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices. Note 22, identified at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, applies.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<p>Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), 8532 Marina Bay Dr., MacDill AFB, FL 33621, requires exhibition space for the LandWarNet Conference held in Broward County from 18 - 20 Aug 2009. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association International (AFCEA), 4400 Fair Lakes Ct, Fairfax, VA 22033-3899. Interested parties may e-mail Joyce Wright at joyce.wright@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, no later than Wednesday, 10 June 2009, 10:00 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by Thursday, 11 June 2009, 9:00 a.m. EST will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) <br />The LandWarNet conference is an annual event that is sponsored and held by Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA) and is an opportunity for the Joint Communication Support Element (JCSE) to display it's latest technology and learn about the latest technology being used by our peer organizations around the world. This conference is a vital means for us to advertise our services out to customers and learn about new and emerging technologies that we might take advantage of. The cost of renting the space is $25 per square foot for military. Non-military members are charged $35.00 per square foot. The space needed to fully display our gear is 400 square feet (20ft x 20ft), thus the cost is 400 x $25.00 = $10,000.00 The 20ft x 20ft space is the same space size that is reserved every year. The cost for this exhibition space is that same as it was last year. The only sponsor for this conference is AFCEA and thus, there are no other sources available.</p>

Non-critical failures are defects that are out of specification but do not represent a safety issue or significantly impact operability of the scope.  Critical failures are defects that require repair.  Critical defects are generally safety issues or defects which impact operability of the scope.  The insertion tube and image are both critical issues.  The buckling on the insertion tube can lead to further damage to the internal elements of the scope.  The orange flare in the image does not allow a clear image. These two items combined would lead to having a full refurbishment done on the scope.Estimated Value: $9,390.00Requesting Service: EngineeringIdentification of Statutory Authority:(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)   Only One Responsible Source(X)  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)   Unusual and Compelling Urgency(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (3)   Industrial, Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental, or                                                                                                                                                     Research Capability or Expert Services(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (4)   International Agreement(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (5)   Authorized or Required by Statute(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (6)   National Security(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (7)   Public InterestRationale in support of citation in Paragraph 4 above: Upon the basis of the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed task order is hereby approved pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302- 2 (b)(1): an unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition and delay in the award of this order would cause harm to the government. The activity proposes to solicit the services of Olympus America Inc., at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, to repair critical and non-critical deficiencies in the scope used in our GI Lab.  This service is critical to the mission of the medical center to ensure the highest quality of care for our patients because without this service the GI Lab will have to cancel cases.Determination of a Fair and Reasonable Cost: Price is based on previous repair jobs done by this company the knowledge of the COTR.  Pricing for these services are also the same that the "public" would pay.Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition: Purchasing these services for Olympus America Inc. will ensure the scope in the GI Lab will be repaired with original equipment manufacturer parts (OEM).Acquisition Plan: An Acquisition Plan   (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition. IT Approval: IT Approval (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI): Computational Cognitive Models of Sensemaking

<CONTACT>Brandon S. Minnery, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-09-02@ugov.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI): Computational Cognitive Models of Sensemaking

Synopsis
The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process.  This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide basic information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential offerors can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA.  Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below.  Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA Program BAA and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution.  The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.

Background & Scope
Intelligence analysts are tasked with identifying relevant information within massive data and synthesizing these fragments into a coherent understanding of the entities, events, and relational networks that characterize a data space. This process of adaptively filtering and interpreting data has been termed “sensemaking” in the literature. However, prevailing models of sensemaking are largely qualitative in nature and fail to reflect emerging insights from cognitive science and neuroscience research regarding the architecture of human information processing.  Current models thus provide a shaky foundation upon which to build a deep understanding of analyst cognition.  IARPA is soliciting submissions on either one or both of the following topics aimed at addressing these challenges:

1)  Cognitive models of sensemaking.  IARPA seeks to characterize the challenges and opportunities associated with developing a new class of predictive, computational cognitive models of the intelligence analysis process.  Responses should briefly outline a path toward creating a cognitive modeling architecture that:

  • Is implemented within a computational framework
  • Captures key human sensemaking behaviors, including failure modes
  • Is scalable, i.e., is not limited to toy problem sets but rather can perform sensemaking over a large, heterogeneous body of  data
  • Is grounded in our current understanding of the cognitive architecture of the human brain

IARPA welcomes diverse approaches that combine neural and symbolic modeling methods as well as techniques from the fields of natural language processing, probabilistic learning theory and artificial intelligence. Whatever methods are employed, the overall model architecture should reflect the known functional organization of the human brain/mind. Respondents should also briefly describe the computing resources that will be required to implement their model at scale.  IARPA recognizes that page limitations will preclude a detailed description of all elements of the model; thus respondents should strive foremost to explain the general properties of their model, its core computational mechanisms, and its gross functional architecture.

2) Test framework for evaluating sensemaking. IARPA seeks new ideas for a test and evaluation framework to be used in assessing the sensemaking capabilities of artificial systems such as the cognitive models described above.  Proposed frameworks should:

  • Include a description of the input/output data 
  • Incorporate graduated levels of difficulty that span a wide range of sensemaking capabilities (from simple model to expert human)
  • Include a suite of component tasks that reflect individual sensemaking behaviors
  • Describe a grading system, including a plan for benchmarking model performance against human performance

Respondents may submit responses to topic 1, topic 2, or both.  If submitting to both topics, respondents should prepare two separate submissions.  Each submission must adhere to the formatting guidelines described below, including page limitations.

The responses to this RFI will be used to help in the planning of a one and a half day workshop on computational cognitive models of sensemaking, the results of which may justify a multi-year competitive program.  The selection of topics and setting of the agenda of this workshop will in part be informed by the responses.  It is anticipated that this workshop will be held in July, 2009.

Preparation Instructions to Respondents
IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program.  IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and estimated cost of the proposed approach.  This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed. 

IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the US.  Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged.  Responses have the following formatting requirements: 
  1. A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-09-02; 
  2. A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary; 
  3. A description (limited to 5 pages in minimum 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins) of the technical challenges and suggested approach(es);
  4. A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached);
  5. Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas.

Submission Instructions to Respondents
Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00pm, Eastern Standard Time on 3 July 2009.  All submissions must be electronically submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-09-02@ugov.gov as a PDF document.  Inquiries regarding this RFI must be submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-09-02@ugov.gov.  Do not send questions with proprietary content.  No telephonic inquiries will be accepted.  


DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES 
This is an RFI issued solely for information and new program planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Respondents are advised that IARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. 

Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  It is the respondents' responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release by the organization that funded whatever research is referred to in their response.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received.  Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the submittal.  Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by IARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.

Archeological investigations associated with this project will include a pre-fieldwork literature and file review; archeological survey covering up to 200 acres; and subsurface archeological survey using up to 200 screened shovel pits and 35 1 x 1 meter excavation units to verify the presence or absence of archeological materials; and complete evaluations of resources sufficient to make a determination of eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  Archeological sites and isolated artifacts will be recorded to professional standards using GPS/GIS technology when possible.  Analysis of collected data will be completed to support preparation of a detailed technical report.  A draft technical report will be submitted to Olympic National Park who will distribute copies to the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe and Washington State Historic Preservation Office for review.  This J&A seeks approval to issue a solicitation to Northwest Archeological Associates, Inc. (NWAA).
3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):
"	Archeological survey and subsurface archeological survey, valued at $88,420.00.
"	Office and lab work, valued at $27,580.00
"	Total estimated value of the proposed contract is $116,000.00.
4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.
	10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1).
5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.
a.	As a result of their past archeological research and investigations in both the park and, more specifically, at numerous Elwha sites, the staff of NWAA has gained irreplaceable important historical knowledge and have established a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (LEKT), who are traditionally associated with the lands of Olympic National Park.  LEKT's creation site is near Elwha Dam.  NWAA's excellent working relationship with the Tribe will facilitate easier consultations.  Based on previous working relationships, Tribal members know that NWAA will conduct the fieldwork and consultations with an appropriate sensitivity for the resources of their ancestral lands.  The Tribe is the original driving force behind the legislation authorizing removal of the dams, and a crucial major stakeholder and land owner in the project.  The Tribe is not agreeable to bringing in a different archaeological consultant at this point.
b.	In addition, NWAA has previously performed archeological survey, testing, and monitoring at several locations within Olympic National Park and gained vital historical knowledge, while performing an excellent job.  The firm is experienced at Olympic National Park and has gained an essential understanding of the park's cultural resources, both below and above ground, as well as the park's geomorphology.  The timeliness and quality of NWAA's past work for Olympic National Park have been well received by the staffs of both the park and the Pacific West Region.  The confidence that the Park and Region staffs have in this firm is a major factor in the LEKT's requirement for NWAA to perform this work.
6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.
	A notice will be published in the GPE (FedBizOpps) per FAR 5.203(a) before issuance of a solicitation to NWAA.  All responses will be reviewed and considered.
7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
	All direct and indirect costs will be negotiated and determined fair and reasonable prior to issuance of the contract.
8.	A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.
	Due to NWAA's excellent relationship with the LEKT, their familiarity with the Park, and the LEKT's request for and the Park's specific recommendation of the firm, no additional market research was conducted.
9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:
a.	Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.
	This J&A seeks approval to proceed with a sole source award to NWAA.  If the GPE notice draws responses from other interested parties, they will be reviewed.
b.	When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.3202-1(a)(2)(ii), and estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.
Not applicable; this acquisition is not a follow-on.
c.	When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.
	Not Applicable.
10.	A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
None.  
11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.
	As indicated in Item No. 6, a notice will be published in the GPE as per FAR 5.203(a) before issuance of a solicitation to NWAA.  Based on performance under this instant procurement, the LEKT, Park, and this office will assess NWAA's ability to complete any future requirements.
12.	The Contracting Officer certifies that subject justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to negotiate a sole-source purchase order with the American Red Cross (ARC) National Headquarters in Washington, DC for office furniture.  This is a one time purchase as DOS is planning to acquire 239,000 sq ft of fully furnished office space from the American Red Cross.  The furniture is only a couple years old and in good usable condition.  By purchasing this furniture from the American Red Cross as DOS signs the building lease, the Department is estimating a savings of over $4 million dollars in product as well as delivery and installation service costs (not including the Government administrative costs of procuring new furniture).  These estimated savings are substantial when compared to having to re-furnish the building and having American Red Cross remove all furniture from the premises which may or may not fit in their new location which will cause an unneeded delay in DOS taking occupancy.
 
This is a SOLE SOURCE procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)) and (FAR 13.501).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1). The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A) (B), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  There will be substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements would occur if we do not proceed under this authority. 

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES, ARC is to sign a lease by end of June, with the understanding that DOS will take the space “as-is”, including the furniture in place as described above. The purchase of the furniture cannot be included in the lease because of the separation between real property and furnishings.  No vendor can provide furniture equal to the existing without having to design, produce and install the product to provide 974 offices/work stations for less than the asking price of $2,000,000.00.  Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government. The Government intends to proceed with the sole source as DOS intends to occupy this new building and accept existing furniture already in place. Responses are due 15 June 2009 12:00pm Eastern Time. Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to MoreauKL@state.gov or via phone at 202-647-2106.

Will Rogers Memorial Center
3401 W. Lancaster Avenue
Fort Worth, TX  76107

We invite you to the GSA Stimulus Forum to learn the latest information about GSA’s implementation of Recovery Plan projects and initiatives that will take place in our five-state region, which includes Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.

We will begin the Forum with an overview of GSA’s Recovery Plan and provide the location, funding, project descriptions and timing on the 33 projects slated for action across this region.  Since the Recovery Plan is meant to stimulate the economy as quickly as possible, many of these projects will be carried out by current GSA contractors.  However, there will still be a number of prime and subcontracting opportunities available for new contractors.

We will also provide useful information on participating in GSA’s Schedule Program and teaming arrangements.  The Forum will conclude with a question and answer session with GSA contracting officers and project managers.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds measures necessary to convert Federal facilities into high-performance green buildings.  GSA will renovate and construct Federal buildings, courthouses and land ports of entry.  We are looking for cost effective, high quality and environmentally friendly commercial products and services.

There is no cost to attend the Forum, but we ask you to pre-register by sending an e-mail to R7smallbiz@gsa.gov with the following information.  The parking is FREE.

<DESC><p>MSC NGW INDUSTRY DAYS SUMMARY</p>
<p>MSC and DISA hosted an Industry Days for the Military Sealift Command (MSC) Next Generation Wideband (NGW) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Capabilities Focused Procurement from 13 - 17 April 2009 at SAIC in McLean, VA. The purpose of this unclassified conference was to enable the Department of Defense (DOD) representatives to obtain information from industry experts on commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) services, commercial practices and how industry might best meet MSC needs. Industry was initially asked to respond to a Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) Request for Information (RFI) posted at www.FedBizOps.gov on 1 April 2009. Twenty-four companies responded to the RFI; 14 of these were small businesses. All respondents were invited to attend the one-on-one sessions and answer additional questions from DoD. Twenty companies accepted this invitation; 11 were small businesses. Information obtained from these activities will be used by DOD to better understand industry's ability to support MSC NGW requirements. It will be fundamental to shaping DOD's future NGW efforts. It will also be useful in obtaining a repository of industry considerations to inform acquisition strategy development. Some specific changes that have been identified as a result of Industry Days include: a) increasing the radome size to 1.5 meters; b) reducing the required worldwide coverage area; c) commercial maritime standards will be acceptable in lieu of MILSTDs except when noted; d) all equipment must be certified; e) availability requirements will be clarified to reflect both RF-only availability and end-to-end-availability; f) static IP architecture will be required; g) JIPM requirement is to be compliant with the<br />JIPM modem within 36 months of it's availability at IOC: and h) The responsibility for all host nation agreements will reside with the vendor. <br />This information is provided to assure industry representatives of the value of the information obtained during Industry Days. This information is not confirmation that an RFP will be issued.</p>

2.  Contractor’s past performance shall include a list of contracts, preferably three, commercial or government that has been performed within the last five (5) years.

(4) Contractor DUNS Number and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.
(5) Technical information (as stated below under FAR 13-106-2)
(6) Signed acknowledgements of amendments (applicable only if any amendments are issued against this solicitation)

4.  Contractors are required to include a copy of the FAR provision 52.212-3-Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items and DFAR 252.212-7000-Offeror Representation and Certification-Commercial Items with its proposal or may indicate completion of the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include the certifications along with the price proposal or to complete the certifications on the internet may result in elimination from consideration for award.

FAR 13-106-2 Evaluation of Quotations or Offers - The Government intends to evaluate quotes in response to this quotation and will award one firm-fixed price contract using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Quotations shall be evaluated only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following two (2) non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:  Factor 1 – Technical capability and Factor 2 – Past Performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If a proposal has been determined acceptable (go) on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror’s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then that its proposal evaluated for the lowest price.

Factor 1 - Technical capability - The minimum criteria for acceptably for this factor shall be the submission on information that clearly indicates that the contractor is certified in the repair of Raymond equipment, and able to obtain the software and parts needed to repair the equipment.

Factor 2 - Past Performance - By past performance the Government means the offeror’s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror’s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror’s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In evaluating an offeror’s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror’s proposal and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.  The information provided should reflect similar contracts for the same or similar type products

(b)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

<DESC><p>A. Overview/Background
<p>V-PYRRO/NO (Chemical Abstract Services Registry Number 179344-98-0) is a promising organ-protective agent under evaluation as a possible treatment for a variety of liver disorders, include acetaminophen toxicity, lipopolysaccharide-induced shock, and fulminant liver failure. Its synthesis is described in the following paper: Hong et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 2009, 50, 2069-2071. The Government currently needs a bulk supply of this agent for further testing.</p>
<p>B. Description of Work</p>
<p>The project involves the process of synthesis of the V-PYRRO/NO in bulk quantity. The Government will provide up to 20 g of NIH patented PYRRO/NO, sodium salt. The Subcontractor will follow the procedures outlined in Hong et al, or suitable modifications, to install the vinyl group at the terminal oxygen of the PYRRO/NO anion.</p>
<p>The Subcontract shall perform the actions needed to produce and transfer the compound material, along with a data package documenting the purity of the compound, to the NCI. The documents must include NMR, UV, and HPLC data consistent with 99% purity or better, along with combustion analysis data for carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen (with each element being within 0.4% of the calculated values).</p>
<p>C. List of Deliverables &amp; Reporting Requirements</p>
<p>Subcontractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>i. The minimum quantity of compound material guaranteed to be supplied.<br />ii. Data package of analytical information mentioned above.<br />iii. Project schedule outlining manufacturing procedures, a proposed production schedule, and quality assurance/control protocols.</p>
<p>D. Project/Cost or Price Schedule</p>
<p>Subcontractor will submit a firm, fixed-price proposal in US Dollars (USD $) to perform the work description and provide the deliverables noted above. Subcontractor will identify the number of grams of starting PYRRO/NO sodium salt they will need to support the amount of compound material being quoted for delivery in their formal response. PLEASE NOTE - If Subcontractor has a current license covering the royalty payments over the sale of stated NIH patented materials, they are requested to provide their current license information along with their formal submission to support their cost estimate. Subcontractor WILL NOT be required to obtain such a license to perform the work contained within this SOW.</p>
<p>E. Additional Requirements</p>
<p>The Subcontractor shall provide all documentation concerning the production of the compound material as stated in this SOW in English, and in both printed &amp; electronic formats.</p>
<p><br />F. Acceptance Criteria</p>
<p>The Subcontractor will be paid to perform the work and produce the compound material based on the following:<br />i. Written acceptance of compound materials by the NCI. NOTE - Delivery of compound materials DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE.<br />ii. Supply an additional small sample (approx. 10 mg) before acceptance, so the NCI can independently validate purity of the compound material produced. <br />iii. Written acceptance of data package.</p>

Shall contain no lamps, which may require cooling fans that ventilate to the atmosphere.

Weight

The video borescope system shall weigh less than 16 lbs. completely assembled with battery installed.

Survivability

The video borescope system shall, in its operational state, meet the following Mil-Std-810F tests:

1. Explosive Atmosphere, Method 511.4, Procedure I 
2. Blowing Rain, Method 506.4, Procedure I 
3. Sand and Dust, Method 510.4, Procedure I 
4. Salt Fog, Method 509.4 
5. Humidity, Method 507.4 
6. Vibration, Method 514.5, Procedure I

Hi-temperature warning system

Because video borescopes can be damaged by inserting them into hot engines:

The video borescope system shall incorporate a Hi-temperature warning system, which at a minimum shall provide the following functions for high temperature warning:

1. Shall display a Hi-temperature warning indicator on the screen as the temperature rises above180ºF.  
2. Shall display a second Hi-temperature warning indicator on the screen as the temperature reaches 212ºF.  
3. Shall additionally display a Hi-temperature warning message on the screen at 212ºF to prompt the user to remove the scope from the hot engine averting damage to the insertion tube.
4. Shall additionally sound and an audible alert at 212ºF to provide redundant warning.

Battery operation

The video borescope system shall incorporate a rechargeable internal sealed battery.
The battery shall provide no less than 2.0 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.  
The video scope system shall include two batteries.
The video borescope system shall include a quick charge, sequential recharger that charges two batteries.
The recharger shall be capable of fully recharging a battery in less than 2.0 hours.

Insertion tubes

The insertion tube shall be 4.0mm in diameter and shall be 2.0 meters in working length.
The insertion tubes shall contain no fiber optics for greater reliability.

LED illuminated tip adapters

The video borescope system shall contain LED’s in the tip adapters so there are no lamps to replace in the system making it more reliable.  And, so there are no fibers in the insertion tube making it more reliable.
  
Automatic Recognition Video borescope tip adapters

All tip adapters for the video borescope system shall be 4.0mm in diameter and incorporate automatic tip recognition.  Which can reduce the possibility of FOD due to tip lose.

The system shall include tip adapters with the following optical characteristics:

1. Field of view: 120 degrees, Direction of view: Forward, Depth of field: 4mm to 190mm.
2. Field of view: 120 degrees, Direction of view: Forward, Depth of field: 25mm to Infinity.

The DRF is intended to aide the user in determining the best distance for accurate measurements via real time display of real tip to target distance in inches or millimeters. 

Image storage

The video borescope system shall provide three ways to store images:

1. Internal solid-state memory.
2. Removable compact flash memory card.
3. Removable thumb drive memory.

Monitor

The system monitor shall be a minimum of 6 “, measured diagonally, for easy viewing.  It shall be completely removable from the base unit to facilitate field interchangeability.  Additionally reducing potential repair costs.

Clin 0002, 1 each shipping charges to NAS Patuxent River MD  20670.

(End of clause)INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS (NAVSEA) (JUN 2007)(a)  In accordance with the clause of this contract entitled "ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUESTS" (DFARS 252.232-7003), the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will utilize the DoD Wide Area Workflow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF) system to accept supplies/services delivered under this contract.  This web-based system located at https://wawf.eb.mil provides the technology for government contractors and authorized Department of Defense (DoD) personnel to generate, capture and process receipt and payment-related documentation in a paperless environment.  Invoices for supplies/services rendered under this contract shall be submitted electronically through WAWF.  Submission of hard copy DD250/invoices may no longer be accepted for payment.(b)  It is recommended that the person in your company designated as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Electronic Business (EB) Point of Contact and anyone responsible for the submission of invoices, use the online training system for WAWF at http://wawftraining.com.  The Vendor, Group Administrator (GAM), and sections marked with an asterisk in the training system should be reviewed.  Vendor Quick Reference Guides also are available at http://acquisition.navy.mil/navyaos/content/view/full/3521/.  The most useful guides are "Getting Started for Vendors" and "WAWF Vendor Guide".(c)  The designated CCR EB point of contact is responsible for activating the company's CAGE code on WAWF by calling 1-866-618-5988.  Once the company is activated, the CCR EB point of contact will self-register under the company's CAGE code on WAWF and follow the instructions for a group administrator.  After the company is set-up on WAWF, any additional persons responsible for submitting invoices must self-register under the company's CAGE code at https://wawf.eb.mil. (d)  The contractor shall use the following document types, DODAAC codes and inspection and acceptance locations when submitting invoices in WAWF:Type of Document (contracting officer check all that apply)	Invoice (FFP Supply & Service)	X	Invoice and Receiving Report Combo (FFP Supply)		Invoice as 2-in-1 (FFP Service Only)		Cost Voucher (Cost Reimbursable, T&M , LH, or FPI)		Receiving Report (FFP, DD250 Only)DODAAC Codes and Inspection and Acceptance Locations (contracting officer complete appropriate information as applicable)Issue DODAAC	N63394	Admin DODAAC		Pay Office DODAAC		Inspector DODAAC	N63394	Service Acceptor DODAAC	N63394	Service Approver DODAAC	N63394	Ship To DODAAC	N63394	DCAA Auditor DODAAC		LPO DODAAC	N/A	Inspection Location	Destination	Acceptance Location	DestinationAttachments created in any Microsoft Office product may be attached to the WAWF invoice, e.g., backup documentation, timesheets, etc.  Maximum limit for size of each file is 2 megabytes.  Maximum limit for size of files per invoice is 5 megabytes.(e)  Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document(s), you will be prompted to send additional email notifications.  Click on "Send More Email Notification" and add the acceptor/receiver email addresses noted below in the first email address block, and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.  This additional notification to the government is important to ensure that the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into WAWF. Send Additional Email Notification To:(WAWF Id Acceptor)  TBD@navy.mil(Alternate WAWF Id Acceptor)  TBD@navy.mil
(f)  The contractor shall submit invoices/cost vouchers for payment per contract terms and the government shall process invoices/cost vouchers for payment per contract terms.  Contractors approved by DCAA for direct billing will submit cost vouchers directly to DFAS via WAWF.  Final voucher submission will be approved by the ACO.(g)  The WAWF system has not yet been implemented on some Navy programs; therefore, upon written concurrence from the cognizant Procuring Contracting Officer, the Contractor is authorized to use DFAS's WInS for electronic end to end invoicing until the functionality of WInS has been incorporated into WAWF.(h)  If you have any questions regarding WAWF, please contact the WAWF helpdesk at the above 1-866 number or the local  WAWF point of contact Karen Dawley at 805 228 0921 or Karen.Dawley@navy.mil (End of clause) ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUESTS AND RECEIVING REPORTS (MAR 2008)	(a)  Definitions.

(2)  "Electronic form" means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all affected systems.  Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests.  However, scanned documents are acceptable when they are part of a submission of a payment request made using Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) or another electronic form authorized by the Contracting Officer.		(3)  "Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.	(b)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts:  Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input.

<p>AmeriCorps*NCCC - Statement of Work - for<br />SAFETY and FIRE BOOTS</p>
<p>1. HISTORY: AmeriCorps*NCCC is a residential national service program operated by the Corporation for National and Community Service. The AmeriCorps*NCCC mission is to strengthen communities and develop leaders through team-based national and community service. Built on the legacy of the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, AmeriCorps*NCCC is premised on the belief that civic responsibility is an inherent duty of all citizens and that national service can effectively solve local problems while providing opportunities to learn practical skills and engender a life-long commitment of service to others. The AmeriCorps*NCCC mission is accomplished through the engagement of young people ages 18 - 24 in team based service on projects in local communities throughout designated regions of the country.</p>
<p>2. GENERAL: Our program requires the members to work on construction sites, trails, and other rigorous work sites that make it imperative they wear safety boots. Non-steel toe boots are also necessary to support the wild fire fighting mission. Therefore, an experienced provider is needed to deliver and fit the boots they provide at the time of fitting. This is with the exception of fire boots since they will be provided according to size fitted when the members arrive.</p>
<p>3. SERVICE NEED: AmeriCorps*NCCC's campuses require a safety boot provider for new volunteers (referred to as members throughout this document). There are four types of boots requested. One is a standard steel-toe boot, a composite-toe boot for cold climates, a summer service safety boot, and a wild fire boot. Specific specifications are provided in Section 4 (Boot Specifications). Campuses normally commence in two seasons-fall and winter. These openings may change at the discretion of the Corporation and the provider must provide on-site fittings of boots that coincide with the arrival or our members.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received by the due date and time in this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses received to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is W911W6-09-C-0037 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Under this effort, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) intends to award a firm fixed price contract utilizing FAR Part 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items, to acquire the M134 DH and M240 H weapons gun mounting platform components to include the Left Hand Forward Door Mount System (LDM) and Centerline Rear Cabin Mount System (CRM) with the below listed features.  The intended source for this acquisition is Dillon Aero, Inc., 8009 East Dillons Way, Scottsdale, AZ 85280.   The Government deems the required gun mounting platform components to be available only from Dillion Aero because the Government does not own with sufficient rights the technical data to enable any other source to manufacture the complete mounting system.  The required components of the gun mounting platform are a logical extension of the proprietary components already designed and manufactured solely by Dillon.   The purpose of this contract is to acquire gun mounting platform systems compatible with the M134 DH / M240 H guns on desirable aircraft, identified as:  Left Hand Forward Door Mount System (LDM) Part Number DGMT 7001, total quantity of nine (9); Centerline Rear Cabin Mount System (CRM) Part Number DGMT 7025, total quantity of four (4); M240 Cradle Assembly, Part Number DGMT 0500, total quantity of thirteen (13).  Delivery of the first shipment is 30 days after contract award (anticipated award date 25 June 2009) to Fort Bliss,  El Paso, TX which includes one (1) prototype of each system (1 LDM and 1 CRM and 2 Cradle Assemblies).  The remaining quantities (8 for LDM and 3 for CRM and 11 Cradle Assemblies) will be delivered on September 10, 2009 to AATD Ft. Eustis, VA.  The proposed contract will include the contractor supplying all associated hardware for mounting these components on the Floor Plates and the Floor Plates to the aircraft.  It is also a requirement to provide these parts as kitted components, shipped in individual (foam filled) shipping containers suitable for shipping overseas.  This synopsis/ solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.  The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference. Please review the provision carefully to ensure that you are submitting all required information with your proposal.

There is no comprehensive infrastructure plan for Afghanistan that brings together heterogeneous technical information on infrastructure programs incorporating economic, social, legal and political realities and stakeholder needs.  There is a paucity of analytic techniques and systematic cognitive frameworks that enable effective allocation of resources for sustainable infrastructure projects (over both space and time) in order to greatly enhance the return of investments to Afghan society.  The Afghanistan Sustainable Infrastructure Plan (ASIP) will apply a system of systems approach, providing tools that will assist program planners in the development of sustainable infrastructure capabilities in Afghanistan and the region, in support of national strategic objectives.  The ASIP methodology will addresses implications across five areas  political, security, rule of law, social well being, and economic growth and is based on Stakeholder Asset-based Planning Environment (SHAPE) methodology.  ASIP allows multiple actors to operate from a shared vision of Afghanistans infrastructure environment, to coordinate and to integrate intervention options through a common operational plan.  <BR><BR>1.2 Objective.  The objective of this contract is to bring together heterogeneous components of Afghanistan infrastructure-based programs that incorporate economic, social, legal and political realities to meet stakeholder needs in support of the goals of ASIP.  This is not about traditional engineering components of infrastructure but focused on those additional capabilities that are required to create a sustainable system in the Afghan environment  driving toward outcomes not outputs.  Additionally, the contractor will share the knowledge gained from other efforts to develop an overarching framework and enhance ASIP products.<BR><BR>2.0  Purpose<BR>The SOW defines the requirements for the tasks, the period of performance, communication methods, and interim and final deliverables.<BR><BR>3.0  Task Definition<BR>3.1  Task 1 - Ten Functions of the State<BR>As documented in the book, Fixing Failed States, by Ashraf Ghani and Clare Lockhart, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008) this task addresses ten (10) critical functions performed by a State.  The contractor shall relate these functions to Afghanistan, provide a status for each function, and make specific recommendations for implementation.<BR><BR>3.2  Task 2 - Support/Input for Workshops<BR>Contractor shall provide support for two workshops on ASIP to refine a model for a system of systems approach to the creation of sustainable infrastructure capabilities in the Afghan environment that incorporate economic, social, legal and political realities to meet stakeholder needs in support of the goals of ASIP.  One workshop will be held in Kabul, Afghanistan and one workshop will be held in Washington, DC.  The contractor shall participate in panels and other forums conducted at each workshop and shall provide input to workshop products.  The contractor shall make presentations of their work at each workshop, as determined by the Government.  The contractor shall not be responsible for organizing the workshops.<BR><BR>3.3  Task 3 - Critique and Support of Models<BR>The contractor shall review and comment on the system of systems model prior to the workshops (Part I), and shall perform a review and critique of the model following the workshops (Part II).  The contractor shall develop an overarching framework supported by the model that incorporates components important in Afghanistan such as international compacts, sovereignty strategies, shared rules, corruption, legitimacy and harmonization of donor resources. <BR><BR>3.4  Task 4 - Provide Expertise on the Environment<BR>The contractor shall serve as the subject matter expert, providing information and advice on all aspects of Afghanistan relevant to ASIP.  The contractor shall assist in making connections in-country and shall provide a list of points of contact.   <BR><BR>3.5  Task 5 - Analyze SHAPE/ASIP<BR>The contractor shall analyze and document the similarities, differences and interface between the SHAPE/ASIP planning methodology and their concepts and strategy for building state, market and civil society functions, identifying methodological, process, and terminology components.  The contractor shall use the outcome of the workshops and products of ASIP tools to develop and integrate implementation guidance based on the ASIP recommendations for Afghanistan.<BR><BR>3.6  Task 6 - Tools for Stability Operations<BR>The contractor shall identify tools and capabilities for measuring impact of stability operations, to analyze and document the similarities and differences between the tool Measuring Progress in Conflict Environments (MPICE) and other tools.  The contractor shall make recommendations for updating and integrating MPICE into strategic planning tools.<BR><BR>4.0  Period of Performance<BR>The period of performance is 10 months from date of award. <BR><BR>5.0  Government Furnished Information/Equipment<BR>The Government shall provide the contractor with the latest version of the system of systems model for use in the two workshops: specifically, SHAPE documentation, ASIP Tool documentation, workshops intent and results, and documentation for MPICE.<BR><BR>6.0  Critical Personnel<BR>The contractor shall strive to maintain the same team of managers and subject matter experts throughout the period of performance of this task order.  In the proposal, the contractor shall provide the names and resumes (if not already on file with the Government) of all critical management and technical personnel, and identify their functions with respect to the work to be performed.  The contractor shall seek approval from the Government before making any change to their task order team.  The contractor shall not charge professional labor hours to this task order for any other contractor personnel without prior approval of the Government.<BR><BR>7.0  Direct Coordination<BR>The Contractor shall coordinate directly with the contract manager for this task order for all technical issues and direction.  The Government will arrange for the contractor to meet with other Government organizations as required.<BR><BR>8.0  Meetings and Reviews<BR>8.1  One kick-off meeting, held at Headquarters, U. S.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the ONLY solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request For Quote number RFQ HSCG44-09-Q-TED714.This number is for tracking purposes only.  Solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32 Amd.. This procurement will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 12. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334511.  The SBA size standard in Employee Size is 750. This is Not a Small Business Set-Aside, due to this acquisition being a Sole Source Procurement it is not anticipated that there will be 2 or more qualified Small Business Concerns to provide pricing for this requirement. The USCG Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN) Ports. Va. 23703 intends to purchase on a non-competitive basis with Sperry Marine for the purchase of 2 each  BME Processor, EU & AIS PN#65890ZAR. The Coast Guard does not own nor can they obtain specifications, drawings, plans or other technical data for these material/items. Request for drawings/specs will be disregarded. The proposed contract action resulting from this synopsis/solicitation for commercial supplies is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons/parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis/solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement, and for informational purposes. The contractor for this proposed Sole Source contract is: SPERRY MARINE, Cage Code# 03956. This is an Sole Source Procurement. 
Sole Source Statement: The USCG presently owns via competitive awarded contracts 16 each 225 ft. Seagoing Buoy Tenders(WLB), and 14 each 175 ft. Coastal Buoy Tenders(WLM) vessels. The WLB were delivered with 2 different Radar configurations, the “A” Class (Hulls 201-205) and the “B” Class (Hulls 206-216). The WLM and the WLB “A” Class have the SPERRY RASCAR 2500C Radar, while the WLB “B” Class has the SPERRY BridgeMaster-E Radar. The RASCAR 2500C is no longer in production and extremely limited manufacture support is available and therefore, it is determination of CG-64 that it has reached the end of life cycle. As a result, the RASCAR 2500C is unsupportable both technically and logistically. The WLM and WLB are the USCG primary platforms used for maintaining the safe navigation of our coastal shipping channels and have become major assets in the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) arena. The Radar is a critical part of the Ships navigation equipment. Given the Missions  of the Buoy Tenders and the efficiencies/savings gained by supporting only 1 Radar System, it is highly desirable that the BridgeMaster-E System be standardized for the Buoy Tender Fleet and replace the obsolete RASCAR 2500C.

 The USCG has opted to go to a standardization of the Radars, by the Coast Guard Standardization Program as allowed by FAR 6.302-1(b)(4)

The Items required for this procurement, BME Processor, EU & AIS PN#65890ZAR, are only available from the OEM Sperry Marine Cage Code # 03956. 
Due to the CG utilizing the Sperry Radar Systems for the WLM/WLB’s platforms it is determined that no other contractor/vendors equipment would not be compatible with these systems. 




The government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible bidder proposal conforming to the solicitation which will be most advantageous and BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered.

1.0 Objective
The United States Marshals Service, Technical Operations Group, Tactical Support Branch (TOG/TSB) Mission Tracking and Inventory Control Database will provide a mechanism for tracking and reporting on non-investigative work products and projects as well as an integrated inventory control system for TOG/TSB accountable property.  This application will be used by approximately 25 users in 10 offices nation-wide.

The objectives of the database are to track, maintain, and report
	-personnel assigned TOG/TSB tasks
	-equipment used for TOG/TSB tasks
	-operational and expense data associated with TOG/TSB tasks
	-project codes used to fund TOG/TSB activities
	-current antenna site lease information
	-accountable property assigned to TOG/TSB and its personnel.

2.0 Scope
The contractor shall provide the software application development and engineering support required to execute the following tasks in support of the USMS.

2.1 Create a relational database to track TSB work products and accountable property.
2.2 Create an HTTP based front-end for the database or other suitable front end application.
2.3 Deliver a reporting capability compatible with Crystal Reports.
2.4 Import existing data into the database.
2.5 Share database information with other similar applications
2.6 Create a comprehensive disaster recovery plan.
2.7Application support and maintenance.


3.0 Tasks
The contractor shall provide the design and development labor required to execute the following tasks in support of the USMS.

Task 3.1 Create a relational database to track TSB work products and accountable property.
The contractor shall create and deliver a robust relational database to track TSB work products and property inventory using Microsoft SQL Server or another database solution based on vendor recommendations.  Both custom-built applications and commercial off the shelf applications will be considered provided they can satisfy all USMS TSB technical requirements.
 
The database shall meet the following specifications:

3.1.1	Database will be created using Microsoft SQL Server or another database solution based on vendor recommendations.  USMS TSB currently has a Microsoft SQL Server 2005 license with 5 CALs.  Any related software license expenses will be the responsibility of the USMS whether SQL or otherwise.
3.1.2	The database should be relational and fully normalized.
3.1.3	All documentation relating to the structure of the database should be delivered to the USMS.
3.1.4	The database will operate on a server running Windows Server 2003 supplied by the USMS.  We currently utilize a number of Dell 2950 servers. The hardware for this effort can reutilize existing hardware or new hardware as agreed upon by the USMS and selected vendor. Hardware costs related to this effort will be the responsibility of the USMS.  We are not utilizing Cluster server currently.  Cluster server can be utilized if necessary.
3.1.5	The vendor will provide all necessary technical assistance required to implement the database in the USMS/DOJ WAN environment.  
3.1.6	The inventory control portion of the database will need to support commercially available barcode scanners.  All hardware associated with this requirement will be provided by the USMS, based on vendor recommendations.  We would prefer to have a wireless, network connected barcode reading solution to be deployed in approximately 10 offices nation-wide.   Wireless scanners may or may not have line of site to network access points.  Much of our inventory is temporarily assigned to off site locations.  We need the ability to “scan” items out of our property and back in upon receipt.
3.1.7	The inventory control portion of the database will need to be scalable to eventually support commercially available RFID solutions.  USMS TSB does not currently have a requirement to implement RFID scanners, however, the application should be designed in such a way that this technology can be added at some point in the future.

Task 3.2 Create an HTTP based front-end for the database or other suitable front-end application.

Create and deliver a web based front-end which will query the database to provide efficient, user friendly access to the data.  If a custom http based front end is not feasible we will consider options such as Microsoft Access 2007 or other suitable applications determined by USMS and the vendor.

The front-end shall meet the following specifications:

3.2.1 	The front-end shall be http based to be launched from the USMS TSB intranet site.
3.2.2	The front-end shall operate efficiently in a multi-user, WAN environment, supporting 25 concurrent users in approximately 10 offices nation-wide.
3.2.3	Access to the client workstation shall be controlled via user id and password authentication against the USMS Active Directory domain.
3.2.4	User privileges within the application should be configurable at the form and/or table level to allow or prevent user’s ability to add, modify or delete records.
3.2.5	Client application needs the ability to create barcodes for accountable property.  Any barcode label printer or other hardware associated with this task will be the responsibility of the USMS
3.2.6	Client Configuration shall adhere to USMS configuration standards.  The USMS Information Technology Division ensures the USMS adheres to DOJ computer security policy. This generally relates to server security configurations. In addition client security configurations are also set forth by USMS ITD and DOJ. The application must be able to function in this environment. Technical information and collaboration will be provided to ensure the vendor has the required information to accomplish this.
3.2.7	The vendor will provide all necessary technical assistance required to implement the front end of the database in the USMS/DOJ WAN environment.
3.2.8	All source code and documentation pertaining to the structure of the front-end shall be delivered to the USMS.  We require the ability to maintain the application and make modifications independent of the original software developer.  If the source of the application is an existing commercial application the USMS will agree to discuss the issue further.
·	Source code shall include thorough in line comments and documentation to express programmer’s intent.

Task 3.3 Deliver a reporting capability compatible with Crystal Reports.
The contractor shall provide functionality for the users to create ad hoc and predefined reports from the database.  The database is required to have the ability to interface with Crystal Reports.  Reports should be able to parse table information by date range, user input, object type, etc…  These will be simple reports, designed by the USMS once the table structure is completed.  We estimate 10 pre-defined reports will be required.
 
Task 3.4 Import existing data into the database.
Data currently exists in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and a Microsoft Access database.  Existing Microsoft Excel data consists of approximately 500 rows of alphanumeric data and will map to fields created for the new application.  Existing Access database is extremely limited and consists of fewer than 150 records.  The contractor shall import existing data into the newly created database.  The USMS currently owns licenses for Crystal Reports, any additional licenses will be the responsibility of the USMS.

Task 3.5 Create a comprehensive disaster recovery plan.
The contractor shall create and deliver a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to include recommendations for database mirroring and automatic backup of all data.  Any hardware or software required for the recommended backup and recovery procedures will be the responsibility of the USMS.

Task 3.6 Application support and maintenance.
The contractor shall provide an option to purchase a support and maintenance package for a warranty period of one year with subsequent maintenance as agreed to by vendor and USMS.


Task 3.7 Application implementation and testing.  
The contractor will implement the application on the USMS WAN and conduct tests necessary to confirm the database is fully operable.  This implementation and testing will be defined by the contractor and USMS and a written test result is required upon completion.  All capabilities and functionality will be demonstrated/documented in this phase.

4.0 Period of Performance
The exact timeline for work to be completed is negotiable; however, our expectation is that the proposed work will be fully implemented within 6 - 12 weeks of contract award.  If the application support and maintenance option referenced in Task 3.6 is purchased, the warranty period will begin as soon as the application is implemented and testing is completed.

5.0 Deliverables
5.1   Microsoft SQL Server Database
5.2   Database Design Documentation
5.3   Front-end Application/User Interface
5.4   Source Code
5.6   Disaster Recovery Plan
5.7   Implementation and Test Phase Documentation

6.0 Fees and Recurring Costs
The proposed work shall include no additional licensing fees or mandatory recurring costs

7.0 Work Location
All development tasks will be performed at the contractor’s site.  Implementation and testing will be performed at the USMS TSB location in either Springfield, VA or Houston, TX depending on vendor selection.

8.0 Evaluation Criteria
All bids from potential vendors will be evaluated using the following criteria:
·	Ability of the proposed solution to satisfy technical requirements
·	Cost of proposed solution
·	Time frame for implementation of the application
·	Vendor experience and expertise creating similar applications
·	References provided by vendors

	(1)  The evaluation of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror with that of other competitors. 	 Thus, an offeror with an exceptional record of past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable.
	(2)  In investigating an offeror’s performance, the Government will consider the information provided by the Contractor as well as information obtained from other sources, including past and present customers and their employees; otherfederal government agencies (including National Institutes of Health Contractor Performance System),  state and local government agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; former subcontractors; and others who may have pertinent information.

	(iii) Price.  
	 (1)  Each price quote will be evaluated for reasonableness.  Price reasonableness is a comparison of the proposed price with the prices proposed by other offerors, the Government’s estimate, current prices for the same or similar services, current market conditions, as well as other relevant measures.
	    (2) Contract award will be based on an assessment of which quotation presents the best combination of technical capability, past performance and price.  The Government may make award for other than the lowest price.

B) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
	(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
	(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
	(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
	(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
	(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The 		taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
	(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC><p>CLARIFICATION:</p>
<p>Exhibit planning is an integral part to the overall planning process for facilities. Since NOS National Marine Sanctuaries program has outreach and education as two components of its mission, having a clear understanding as how exhibits fit into to overall fabric of a NOS facility is critical. We are not talking about exhibit design and/or construction -- just planning and layout in terms of physical space and building attributes (e.g., power, lighting, etc.). Moreover, the exhibit planning aids in the development and subsequent implementation of the "vision" for the facility. Thus, we will need to have the PPS Contractor assist NOAA in being the advocate for ensuring the integrity of the "vision" is maintained throughout the life-cycle of the project.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions received from potential offerors as  follows:  

QUESTIONS: Q
ANSWERS: A

Q1.  Will UPS/FedEx/commercial courier agents be permitted to pass through building security and make deliveries anywhere internally within the NRC headquarters complex?  
A1.  No; NRC facilities are controlled-accessed.

Q2.  Will UPS/FedEx/commercial courier be required to deliver only to the mail room?
A2.  Yes; the NRC mail room is the designated point of delivery

Q3.  If a UPS/FedEx/other commercial courier is used for delivering material, what provision is there for reimbursement to the contractor for waiting time incurred by driver/delivery person due to building security delays, absence of receiving personnel, etc.?
A3.  There is no provision to pay for the time it takes for delivery.  

Q4.  Will the delivery person have to go through building security each day and then wait for an escort up to the specified internal delivery point in order to complete timely delivery by 8:30am?
A4.  No; delivery to the NRC mail room is sufficient.  The 8:30 delivery will only be required for daily delivery.  All other delivery times will be 10:30.

Q5.  Will NRC have someone waiting in the lobby at 8:30am to accept packages or will the delivery person have to pass through building security in order to complete deliveries?
A5.  See A4.

Q6.  Will NRC require hand delivery by the contractor or by a commercial courier or other “hand delivery” means?
A6.  No; hand delivery can be delivery by a contractor employee, or someone such as a commercial courier that the contractor uses to make the delivery.

Q7.  Will delivery to the mailroom by 8:30am constitute compliance with timely delivery?
A7.  Yes. See A4.

Q8. Given the nature of the level of security at NRC headquarters, is it customary for the reporter to be escorted at all times within any building?
A8.  Yes.

Q9.  When reporters arrive at NRC headquarters complex (and other NRC facilities), how much time should be allowed for passing through building security and being escorted to the appropriate meeting room?
A9.  Approximately 15 – 30 minutes.

Q10.  Since NRC has indicated its intent herewith to post electronic versions of transcribed proceedings on its website for free public access, will participants and other interested persons not have to pay the contractor for official transcripts?
A10.  They won’t have to, but if they want to buy one, they certainly can.  In some cases the participants may still want to purchase transcripts directly from the contractor for expedience. 

Q11.  On the pricing schedule, provision is made for transcription of video/cassettes/CDs; are sales permitted to the public or other third parties for this category of services?
A11.  As long as they are marked “authorized for sale” on the NRC work order request.

Q12.  Are there any prohibitions on sales to parties for work performed under the unclassified category of work?  If so, please specify.
A12.  See A11.

Q13.  Will NRC provide at no cost to the contractor all software and IT operating programs required to be utilized for encryption/un-encryption of audio and text files or are these expenses to be incurred by the contractor?
A13.  Offerors should propose all costs that it deems are necessary in meeting the requirements of this solicitation. 

Q14.  When encryption/un-encryption is required for electronic transfer of audio and text files between NRC user offices and the contractor, what provision is made for compensation for staff/personnel training and operating time, software ownership/updates, etc. and other contractor incurred expenses both at current volume of services performed and at expected future expanded volumes of required services?
A14.  See A.13.
   
Q.15  Will NRC provide at no cost to the contractor the software and training to comply with the time-coded ascii requirements as specified in this contract?
A15.  See A.13. 

Q16.  If not, what provision is made to compensate the contractor for personnel time spent in preparation and training for the unique and special aspects of time-coded ascii as required by NRC?
A16.  See A13.

Q17.  Further, is the contractor to be compensated in any way for ongoing costs associated with both present levels and future expected expanded levels of time-coded ascii transcripts?
A17.  See A13.  

Q18.  What provision is made for compensation to the contractor for new technologies adopted by NRC and required to be utilized by the contractor?
A18.  Within scope changes to the resultant contract would be handled pursuant with the Changes clause.

Q19.  On the pricing schedule, deliveries are indicated 10 day, 7 day, 3 day, etc., does this use of the word “day” refer to business days or calendar days?
A19.  Business days.

Q20.  Do any users of the contract have the authority to require or request any special binding materials for the transcript deliverables?
A20.  Yes, it will be as indicated on the work order request. (Specifically, there is an occasional request for spiral binding on a minuscript copy.)

Q21.  What provision is made for compensating the contractor for providing Spanish speaking court reporters and/or transcribers?
A21.  There is no extra compensation for this; it is a rare occurrence, happening on average twice per year.

Q22.  What locations, in addition to Puerto Rico, does NRC contemplate requiring Spanish speaking court reporters and/or transcribers?
A22.  The NRC does not anticipate the need in other locations although, we can not rule others out completely.

Q23.  Will the resulting official verbatim record be required to be transcribed in Spanish, Spanish and English, English only?
A23.  English only.

Q24.  Are the Spanish speaking court reporters/transcribers (Section 4.3) required to be bi-lingual in English as well?
A24.  It may not be necessary, as long as the final transcript is in English. 

Q25.  Will all official verbatim proceedings which involve a Spanish speaking court reporter require the record to be translated in to English, into Spanish or both?
A25.  Translated into English.

Q26.  What provision is made for additional compensation to the contractor for reporting and transcribing the extremely technical content of the numerous and frequent NRC proceedings in which the discussion is conducted in heavily accented English and spoken by people for whom English is not their primary language? 
A26.  No additional compensation.

Q27.  Has NRC, consistent with similar patterns elsewhere, adopted the practice of having witnesses submit direct testimony in writing for inclusion in to the official record of hearings, which is referred to as Pre-filed Testimony?
A27.  It may be writing or, some other format as on a CD, however it is submitted, it is to be included in the transcript when so directed.  Pre-filed testimony is submitted ahead of the hearing, but sometimes there are changes made to the actual testimony when it is accepted into the record on the day of the hearing(s).

Q28.  Does this result in shorter hearing duration “on-the-record”?
A28.  It could result in a shorter hearing duration.

Q29.  Despite having shorter “on-the-record” proceedings is the contractor required to include these witnesses’ pre-filed testimony in the official transcript instead of being paid for the pages of verbatim court reporting to capture this testimony?
A.29.  If it is “read” into the record, it has the normal compensation.  If it is added to the record “after the fact” in paper or, some other form, and copies are made, the copies are paid at the page rate as designated (in the contract) for copies.

Q30.  Will additional time be allowed to the contractor for delivery of transcripts of proceedings (or portions thereof) that occur during non-regular hours?
A30.  If a proceeding lasts past 6:00 pm local time, an additional day will be allowed for the delivery of the portion that occurs after 6:00 pm.  An exception would be in the case of an onsite hearing, etc., requiring next day delivery.

Q31.  Will the NRC reimburse the contractor for travel expenses for the frequently remote locations requiring a court reporter?
A31.    See A13.

Q32.  How long does it take, from the time of application, for the NRC Security Office to issue clearances required for classified proceedings?
A32.  Building access/safeguards – approximately 4 weeks.

L and Q  6 weeks if all goes smoothly and no follow-up questions or additional information is required.  Usually, that is not the case, and it takes longer.  If Security asks questions, it is incumbent upon the contractor to reply promptly so that the process proceeds as quickly as possible.

Q33.  How will NRC handle classified assignments while waiting for the security office to process contractor personnel?
A33.  That is an internal NRC issue.  The contractor is responsible for submitting applications promptly, as well as following up if there are questions.  See A32.

Q34.  Are these copies for Internal NRC use or are they distributed to other government agencies or to third parties?
A34.  The copies that are indicated on the work order request are for internal NRC use and are not distributed to other parties of the meetings/proceedings.  However, we do reserve the right to post transcripts on the NRC website where third parties could download them.

Q35.  We do not see where Form 187 is attached to Solicitation No. RS-ASL-09-312.  Could you please point me in the right direction for this?
A35.  See attachment to this amendment.

Q36.  Section 4.3 indicates that “the contractor shall provide a Spanish speaking reporter/transcriber when necessary in place such as Puerto Rico.”  If a Spanish speaking reporter/transcriber is required, will the proceedings be conducted entirely in Spanish or will an interpreter be present?  In the past 12 months, how many times has there been a request for a Spanish speaking reporter?
A36.  There may or may not be an interpreter present  usually, there is not.  The interview (it is not a proceeding as such; it is an investigator asking questions of someone who replies in Spanish) is not conducted entirely in Spanish.  There have only been one or two times in the past year that Spanish speaking has been requested.

Q37.  What percentage of the work will be classified?
A37.  That is an unknown, but in the past it has not exceeded 2%.

Q.38.  What percentage of classified proceedings is expected to be held outside of the DC area?  When a classified proceeding takes place outside of DC, will the reporter need to have a notary public license for the state in which the proceeding takes place?
A38.  A very small percent, if any.  There has been no classified work outside of DC in the past 8 years.  This may change with the High Level Waste Proceeding which will be  held in part, in Las Vegas.  The plan is, if there are any classified portions to try and hold them in DC.  The only classified we have had in the past year, were pre-recorded (by NRC employees) CD's or tapes that were mailed directly to the reporting company for transcription.  Yes, sometimes notaries are required.

Q39.  If a reporter is required to travel for classified work, will the NRC pay for the cost of travel?
A39.  See A13

Q40.  Will the NRC consider price/cost schedules in a format other than the one provided? 
A40.  See A13

Q41  Could you please clarify what is meant by “multiple, simultaneous reporting” as referenced in Section 1.0 of the Statement of Work?
A41.  This means there could be meetings, hearings etc. being conducted on the same day(s) in different locations or, at the same time at the same location.  For example, different offices at Headquarters, in Rockville could be holding meetings at the same time on the same day thus, requiring more than one reporter.

<DESC>Map Files Scanning Prospective Offerors Questions<BR><BR><BR>1.  Accessibility:  Is the building floor level at the pickup location.  Is there a cargo elevator available?  What are the ramp and door sizes?  Is there good parking access?<BR><BR>Reply: The room where the flat-file cabinets containing the maps/drawings is located on the fourth floor.  The vendor will transport the drawings/maps to the vendor's site in the flat file drawers, the largest of which measure approximately 37 inches by 47 inches (this is an update from what is listed in the contract solicitation). The door into the map files room is approx. 78 inches wide.  The hallway is approx. 55 inches wide. The doors leading to the elevators are approx. 33 inches wide in the open position.  The drawers will, in some cases, require a slight tilt to pass through the narrow door.  A cargo elevator and an oversize passenger-type elevator are available both or which are large enough (including the doors) to accommodate the drawers in the flat position.  In each case, there is one narrow door (approx. 33 in. wide) between the hallway and the elevators.   The loading dock/ramp in the alleyway, which has access to the freight elevator, is 40 inches tall.  There is street parking (parking meters) and parking ramps near by.  Short term parking for loading purposes is available in the alley.<BR><BR>2.  Transportability:  Is there a team required for transport or is one person satisfactory?  Does the contractor need to provide loading equipment?<BR><BR>Reply: The contractor will need a minimum of 2 people to load the shallow 1.0 inch and 1.25 inch flat file drawers (containing the documents).  The contractor will need a minimum of 4 people (depending on their strength/physical ability) to load the deeper 2.625 inch and 4.5 inch flat file drawers (containing the documents).  Vendors are welcome to tour our facility to determine if they need loading equipment.<BR> <BR>3.  Security: Do the personnel transporting the paper maps or the hard drives need to have a National Agency check?<BR><BR>Reply:  One person in the transport team (i.e. the transport team's supervisor) needs to have a National Agency check and will be required to personally sign for the documents. <BR><BR>4.  Packaging:  Will the map cabinet drawers need to be crated?  Will the cabinets be transportable, or just the drawers?<BR><BR>Reply: The Government prefers to not crate the drawers.  Transporting an entire cabinet, (containing all the drawers) will be problematic given the narrow doorways and the combined weight of the cabinet plus the paper documents.  If the drawers only are transported, the vendor shall utilize blankets, pads or similar to layer between the stacked drawers.<BR><BR>5.  Moisture Control: Are the maps temperature or humidity sensitive?  Does the contractor need to take preservation measures?<BR><BR>Reply: The government is not aware of any documents, covered under this contract, that require special measures be taken for temperature or humidity sensitivity in the short term.  It is assumed that, other than for very short periods during transport, that the contractor will transport and store the documents in conditions that approximate normal room temperature and humidity levels.   Some of the documents may be stored in a climate controlled facility after they are returned from the vendor.  <BR><BR>6.  Handling: Are there any other handling requirements other than cotton gloves? <BR><BR>Reply: The handling requirements, which go beyond just cotton gloves, are discussed in the solicitation (for example, automatic scanning feeders cannot be used).<BR><BR>Sheet Related Questions:<BR><BR>1.  Sheet sizes:  Do the sheet sizes vary wildly?<BR><BR>Reply: No.<BR><BR>2.  Quantity:  You mention the first year to expect 6,000 maps to scan.  Is there any estimate for the following years?<BR><BR>Reply: Assume Year 2: 24,000, Year 3: 30,000, Year 4: 20,000 and Year 5: 20,000<BR><BR>3.  Contents:  Are the contents monochrome only?  Gray-scale data?  Critical color information?<BR><BR>Reply: All of the information contained on the document, including color, must be captured in the scanned image.  Some of the documents contain critical color information/elements.  Some are gray-scale.<BR><BR>4.  Time issues:  Is there a maximum or minimum time limit before a mandatory return?<BR><BR>Reply: Some of the documents may have to be returned on relatively short notice.  For example, some of the drawings pertain to flood control projects.  These documents may have to be returned in the advent of a flood emergency.  The vendor will be required to furnish selected documents, for pick-up by the Government, with 72 hours notice.<BR><BR>Product and Delivery Issues:<BR>  <BR>1.	Graphics:  Do you expect the contractor to counter-rotate to true-horizontal?  <BR><BR>Reply: Yes, The vendor will orientate the scanned image such that the top of the image is the top of the scanned document as it would appear to a user.<BR><BR>2.  Do you expect the contractor to crop to the actual edge of the paper?<BR><BR>Reply: Yes <BR><BR>3.  File Structure:  What is the image bit depth and the scanned resolution?<BR><BR>Reply:  A minimum of 8 bit is required.  A minimum resolution of 300 PPI is required.  These parameters will be tested during the start up and testing phase.<BR><BR>4.  File output:  Are multi-resolution sets needed or desired?  Will duplicate passes through the scanner be needed?<BR><BR>Reply: No.  One image for one document.  It is not anticipated that duplicate scanner passes will be needed.<BR><BR>General questions<BR><BR>1.     Is there an incumbent for this service?<BR><BR>Reply: No.<BR><BR>2.     Is there allowance for continuous phases of 2500 maps? If not what is the wait time between phases?<BR><BR>Reply: The wait time between phases, or when the next batch of 2,500 drawings would be available for pick-up, could be as long as approximately 90 days.<BR><BR>3.     What is the final application of the raster file supplied by the Contractor (Deliverable 1)?<BR><BR>Reply: The goal is to the have the scanned images available on the server/network in an Oracle database for users to access from their desktop computer. <BR>  <BR>4.     We assume that we are supplying a raster underlay suitable for later affixing geospatial vector shapes.  Is this correct?<BR><BR>Reply: No.<BR><BR>5.     Will consideration of later applications affect the product supplied by the Contractor (size of the file in memory, the granularity of metadata documentation)?<BR><BR>Reply: No.  <BR> <BR>C-6. Deliverables - questions<BR><BR>C-6.1. Deliverable No. 1 <BR><BR>1.

Or, Shall the Government supply a file to which the Contractor is to add documentation of process steps?<BR>                       <BR>Reply: No.<BR><BR>            Granularity:<BR>            <BR>1.	Shall the creation of the raster file data layer be the only step described in the metadata file? <BR><BR>Reply: No.<BR><BR>2.	 Or, Shall all subsequent modifications to the TIFF file or tags also be described?<BR>           Reply: yes<BR><BR>            Description<BR>            <BR>1.

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, in partnership with the Global Cyber Integration Center (GCIC) is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies, projects, and experiments focused on developing capabilities to provide the Air Force the means to conduct Global C2, including C2 of cyber assets. GCIC is a Field Operating Agency (FOA) reporting to the Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Warfighting Integration and Chief Information Officer SAF/XC. GCIC is chartered to conduct innovation, integration, and standardization of current and future command and control systems and sub-systems across air, space AND cyberspace to enable decision superiority. For the purpose of this BAA, AFRL and GCIC will partner to address emerging cyber concepts, technologies, and experimentation to further enhance global and cyber C2 for the warfighter.</p>
<p>Cyber operations can be conducted at any level of war and across the entire spectrum of conflict in support of global and theater objectives. Global C2 provides a persistent, 24/7, collaborative environment comprised of people, systems, and tools to enable timely response to today's asymmetric challenges. Global C2 ties real-time intelligence, collaborative planning, and decision making to support a broad mix of military options - offensive, defensive, kinetic and non-kinetic. Global C2 and cyber C2 capabilities need to be designed, developed, and implemented that provide for the ability to monitor, assess, plan, and execute cyber operations. This BAA focuses on developing cyber concepts, technologies, and an experimentation framework to improve Air Force cyber C2 capabilities and integration of these capabilities with other Air Force and Joint systems.</p>
<p>To frame the intent of this BAA, we need to briefly discuss cyberspace. The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations says, "Cyberspace is a domain characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures."</p>
<p>For the purpose of this BAA, AFRL will focus on technologies to enable C2 of global and cyberspace assets and integrating their effects with kinetic operations. Specific technologies should deliver capabilities that include, but are not limited to Cyber C2 collaboration, interoperability, cross/multi domain, visualization and integration of friendly orders of battle, course of action development, experimentation, Integrated Task Order production, effects deconfliction, hybrid/joint effects, and assessment.</p>
<p>We assert that simply porting technologies developed for C2 in the air and space domain may or may not be directly applicable or useful in the cyber domain. Furthermore, we acknowledge that C2 of non-kinetic assets and the effects they produce and integrating them with kinetic assets/effects across the global spectrum is at a formative stage. With these two concepts in mind, we seek novel and unique approaches to enable Global C2 in an environment that is not confined by time or distance and an area of responsibility that is not constrained by geographical boundaries.</p>
<p><br />FY09 Focus Area - Integrated Tasking Order research</p>
<p>This FY09 focus area seeks novel research and development efforts that advance the state of the art in integrated battle planning to radically improve our ability to coordinate and synchronize air, cyber and space forces to achieve desired effects. Future decision-makers must ensure unity of effort across physical and virtual domains, as current static and deliberate planning struggles to keep up with fluid, highly volatile world states. Plans need to be built quickly, continuously assessed for validity, viability and feasibility, and dynamically updated according to the evolving world state. Plans also need to scale at the strategic level for kinetic and non-kinetic assets; provide enough structure to adequately synchronize, coordinate and deconflict assets at the operational level; and capture adequate fine-grained detail to conduct operations at the tactical level across multiple levels of security.</p>
<p>The Government is looking for technical solutions that provide the ability to represent plans that fully capture and describe air, cyber, and space activities (e.g., one plan representation for all or a collection of highly related representations); the ability to dynamically model and relate air, cyber, and space activities and the ability to automatically manage both plans and models at the pace of modern combat, within a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) (e.g., a plan management service). Being able to plan among distributed enclaves is a desired attribute (e.g., a possible design constraint), but demonstration of such capability is left to other efforts. Submissions may propose tackling just one, several, or all of these abilities.</p>
<p>Resulting capabilities must fit within the evolving net-centric, service oriented USAF C2 enterprise. Therefore, efforts must be compatible with the Net-Centric Enterprise Solutions for Interoperability (NESI), the Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC) and the concepts detailed in USAF Electronic Systems Center's Technical Implementation Architecture (TIA) while also demonstrating independence from specific products, web applications, and database servers. Resulting services are envisioned as being transitioned as a Capability Module (CM) in accordance with NECC guidelines. Information on these standards and guidelines can be found at the following web-sites: NESI Public Website (http://nesipublic.spawar.navy.mil/), DISA NECC Website (http://www.disa.mil/necc/), and USAF ESC TIA Website (http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil/tia/TIA_TRD-V1-for_HERBB.doc). Offerors may submit compelling arguments as to why their solution should not abide by these standards and guidelines.</p>
<p>Focus areas should include a series of Limited Technology Experiments (LTEs) to demonstrate and validate prototypes that resulting capabilities may enable. AFRL will evaluate delivered prototypes in our Command &amp; Control Concept Center. To reduce risk, AFRL is currently running the Office of Naval Research (ONR) SOA Reference Implementation (SOA RI). Consequently, delivered prototypes must work in that environment, although other SOA implementations may be considered, particularly ones that may have more advanced security infrastructures. Because it is expected that several efforts will be awarded to work on specific parts of the challenge, offerors must agree to establish associate agreements with pertinent team members.</p>

<p>7. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>All responses, unclassified/classified, to this announcement must be sent U.S. Postal Service, registered mail and addressed to AFRL/RISF, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505, and reference BAA 08-09-RIKA. Electronic submission is NOT authorized. Questions can be directed to the cognizant technical POC, Wyatt Bora at wyatt.bora@rl.af.mil or (315) 330-4944.</p>
<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. Criteria 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 are equally important and of greater importance than 1.4.</p>
<p>1.1. Overall scientific and/or technical merit, including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational approaches;</p>
<p>1.2. The effort's potential contribution for providing C2 capabilities that meet Air Force cyber requirements within a realistic and reasonable schedule;</p>
<p>1.3. The prospect for effective transfer of produced technologies into Air Force and joint C2 systems; and</p>
<p>1.4. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a.) assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b.) accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c.) handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RISF will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET, TOP SECRET, or TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to classified information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<p>Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), 8532 Marina Bay Dr., MacDill AFB, FL 33621, requires exhibition space for the LandWarNet Conference held in Broward County from 18 - 20 Aug 2009. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association International (AFCEA), 4400 Fair Lakes Ct, Fairfax, VA 22033-3899. Interested parties may e-mail Joyce Wright at joyce.wright@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, no later than Thursday, 11 June 2009, 9:00 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by Thursday, 11 June 2009, 9:00 a.m. EST will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) <br />The LandWarNet conference is an annual event that is sponsored and held by Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA) and is an opportunity for the Joint Communication Support Element (JCSE) to display it's latest technology and learn about the latest technology being used by our peer organizations around the world. This conference is a vital means for us to advertise our services out to customers and learn about new and emerging technologies that we might take advantage of. The cost of renting the space is $25 per square foot for military. Non-military members are charged $35.00 per square foot. The space needed to fully display our gear is 400 square feet (20ft x 20ft), thus the cost is 400 x $25.00 = $10,000.00 The 20ft x 20ft space is the same space size that is reserved every year. The cost for this exhibition space is that same as it was last year. The only sponsor for this conference is AFCEA and thus, there are no other sources available.</p>

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances – the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

•	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
•	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in a field related to business or engineering is desired.
•	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
•	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
•	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
•	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
•	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.
III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbent’s actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.

Entry level salary will normally be at the first step of the grade range for the position.  However, consideration will be given to the successful applicant’s experience that is specifically relevant to the position to be filled.

<p><strong></strong></p>
</p>
<p><strong>5/28/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p>CDC received the following&nbsp;additional question:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong>: Please see the following question related to Section L provision 352.270-19 Electronic information and technology accessibility (January 2006) on RFP pages 46 and 47:
<p>CDC has directed bidders to include a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template as part of the technical proposal. This template is 8 pages long. Would the Government allow bidders to include the completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template as part of the business proposal, so as not to count against the 75 page limit for the technical proposal?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response</strong></span>:&nbsp; CDC hereby <span style="text-decoration: underline;">excludes</span> the Section 508 template from the Technical Proposal 75-page limit.&nbsp; Offerors are instructed to include the completed Section 508 Template as an Appendix (appropriately identified) to the Technical Proposal.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Only this Section 508 Appendix is excluded</span> from the 75-page limit; any other Appendix an offeror includes in the Technical Proposal is subject to the 75-page limit.</p>
<p>CDC&nbsp;has prepared&nbsp;Amendment 0003 (attached) to incorporate this&nbsp;change to the solicitation. The change is added to page 51, Subfactor 1, subparagraph 4).&nbsp; Offerors are reminded to acknowledge receipt of ALL amendments in accordance with the instructions included in the SF 30, block 11 (attached).</p>
<p>&nbsp;_________________ End of Amendment 5/28/2009 notice _________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5/20/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p>CDC received additional questions and has prepared its response provided as an attachment.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Amendment 0002</strong></span> is also attached to incorporate changes to the solicitation arising from the questions received to date. Offerors are reminded to acknowledge receipt of ALL amendments in accordance with the instructions included in the SF 30, block 11 (attached).</p>
<p>_________________&nbsp; End of Amendment 5/20/2009 notice _________</p>
<p><strong>5/18/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p>CDC received another question which is included in the attached response.</p>
<p>Also, CDC has made&nbsp;changes to the Statement of Objectives (SOO) which&nbsp;are included in the attached Amendment (i.e. SF 30).&nbsp; Offerors shall acknowledge the Amendment as per instructions contained in block 11 of the SF 30 (attached).&nbsp; The changes in the SOO are located in paragraphs 9 and 10.&nbsp; The proposal due date remains the same.</p>
<p>____________&nbsp; End of Amendment 5/18/09 notice _______________</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5/13/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Understanding that questions are not due until June 1, 2009, we have a question with regard to the page limit that we believe is critical to offerors as they work to prepare their best responses to this RFP. We wish to clarify that the page limit is indeed 75 pages, inclusive of appendices. Based on experiences bidding other CDC RFPs where this language was included in the RFP and then subsequently amended so that appendices were considered outside the 75-page limit, we wish to clarify this as early as possible in the bid process. To learn that the appendices are excluded the page limit after June 1 will make it virtually impossible for offerors to respond appropriately by the June 22 deadline.
<p>If the page limit stands as it is currently stated in the RFP, we appreciate the clarification and will respond accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>CDC response</strong>:&nbsp;reference Section 'L' on page 50 of the Solicitation, subparagraph L.9 which reads:</p>
<p>L.9 Proposal page format:</p>
<p>Pages shall be 8 &frac12; x 11, Times New Roman font, 12 pt pitch. Page fold-outs will count as 2 pages. Text printed on double-sided pages will also count as two pages. <strong>Where a page limit applies</strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the page limit includes</strong></span> cover letter, table of contents, index, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appendices</span></strong>, attachments, illustrations, charts, tables, diagrams <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and all other documents</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The solicitation stipulates a <strong>75-page limit</strong> for the <strong>Technical Proposal</strong>; thus, since a page limit applies to the Technical Proposal, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>then appendices are included in the page limit</strong></span> pursuant to the instructions in subparagraph L.9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp; End of 5/13/09 Amendment ----</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Notice</strong>:</p>
<p>The solicitation # <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHS-RFP-2009-FTG7</span>&nbsp;is hereby posted as of May 08, 2009.&nbsp; The solicitation is&nbsp;attached to this amendment as MS Word file. Reference Section "L" of the solicitation for detailed&nbsp;proposal preparation and submission instructions.</p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question from an interested offeror</strong>:</p>
<p>According to a recent news article, CDC has received a database from FEMA that is very important for conducting the Children's Health Study. We are wondering whether CDC can release information on the contents of the database (e.g., variables that will be provided to the contractor) before the RFP is released.</p>
<p><strong>CDC's response is as follows</strong>:</p>
<p>The following are the variable fields that I have in the data sets from FEMA:<br /><br />In the applicant database (NEMIS) there are:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />Name - first, last, middle initial<br />Applied date - date applied for assistance<br />email<br />Pre-disaster address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />Current address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />phone number - area code, number<br />alternative phone number - alt area code, alt phone number<br />Social security number<br /><br />FRRATS databases for the states:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />name - first, last<br />Site address (trailer location address) - street, city, state, zip, county<br />lease date<br />vacate date</p>
<p>CDC makes no representation as to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness&nbsp;of the information contained in the FEMA NEMIS database.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Pre-solicitation notice</strong>:<br />This pre-solicitation notice is posted pursuant to FAR 5.203(a), to advise interested offerors of the Government's intent to solicit proposals for a "full and open" competitive acquisition for a project titled: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children's Health Study</span> (CHS). The attached draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) describes the Government's objectives for this acquisition. Offerors responding to the solicitation (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">when it is released</span>) will be responsible for developing and submitting their own Statement of Work (SOW) based upon the objectives contained in the attached draft SOO.</p>
<p><br />The contracting officer's "full and open" acquisition strategy decision is based upon the Government's evaluation of capability statements received in response to a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) posted to FEDBIZOPS on 2/17/2009. The Government will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> accept or consider additional capability statements at this time because the market research phase has ended.</p>
<p>In addition to the draft SOO, this notice also includes questions received in response to the Request for Information (RFI) posted on 11/21/ 2008 and the Government's responses. The attachment was previously posted with the aforementioned SSS and is provided again as a convenience to those interested offerors who may be unfamiliar with the "history" of this acquisition.</p>
<p><br /><strong>No response to this notice is requested or required.</strong></p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for proposals. The contracting officer will request proposals when the solicitation is posted to FEDBIZOPS some time after this 15-day mandatory, preliminary notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Government anticipates making a single contract award for a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) type contract. The rough order magnitude (ROM) of the contemplated contract is between $100Million to $150Million. As explained in the attached draft SOO, the resulting contract will consist of two phases: (1) A two-year Feasibility Study and (2) a six-year Full Study phase.</p>
<p><br />Any questions regarding this notice must be in writing to the contracting officer via email: ftg7@cdc.gov prior to the expiration date of this notice.</p>

for the First Article Test requirement. A proven source is defined as a 
source that meets the criteria for First Article waiver.

award the larger portion of the total requirement to the offeror that 
represents the best value to the Government based on the evaluation scheme 
included in the solicitation. 
(i) If awards will be made to a proven source as well as an unproven 
source, the source that represents the best value to the government shall 
receive not less than 60% of the total requirement. 
(ii) If awards will be made to two unproven sources, the source that 
represents the best value to the government shall receive not less than 
60% of the total requirement.

<CONTACT>Nicholas E Sartain, Contract Specialist, Phone 870-543-7370, Email nick.sartain@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC><p>The project consists of developing three novel flow cytometric reagents for detecting pathogenic bacterial agents in food. The targeted agents are Campylobacter spp.; Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio spp. This procurement will be open to all sources. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541711-Research and Development in Biotechnology and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. The period of performance is 365 calendar days after notice of award for product development. The IDIQ portion period of performance will be 365 calendar days after successful product development. The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price type. The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about June 5, 2009. The solicitation will be available for download on FedBizOpps website when the RFP is issued. Scope of Work Independently and not as an agent of the government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work set forth herein. The contractor shall develop three novel flow cytyometric reagents for detecting pathogenic bacterial agents in food. The targeted agents are Campylobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio spp. These reagents must fluoresce under 488 nm excitation and produce a strong signal in a typical cytometric FL1 channel (525nm) but not significantly in FL2 or FL3 regions. The finished product shall also include additional modifiers that eliminate or significantly reduce assay-confounding auto-fluorescence from the food particles. The finished product of each reagent that can cytometrically detect and count each of the three target pathogens while meeting relevant inclusivity, exclusivity, competitive, linearity, and quantitative detection limit criteria, as well as the capacity to exclude food matrix signal interference for food products with which each target pathogen is commonly associated (e.g. - Campylobacter in pork, Vibrio in seafood, Staphylococcus in raw milk). Acceptable detection of a single CFU can be achieved by a four hour culture in TSB under agent-optimal incubation conditions from a 100 level inoculation followed by 5 uM filtration or other minimal sample preparation, &lt;15 minute incubation followed by flow cytometric detection in 250 &#61549;L of the TSB. Linear dynamic range should be 4 logs or greater. The "Competitive" criterion means that the target organism is correctly detected and counted in up to a 106 excess of a typical non-pathogenic bacterial food contaminant. Inclusivity and exclusivity specifications vary with each agent but mean: &bull; for inclusivity, successful detection of those pathogenic species and strains of each target that are typically found in the US human food supply. &bull; for exclusivity, lack of signal from non-target bacterial organisms commonly found in the same foods as the target. Schedule of Items Item No. Description 01- Development of Campylobacter spp. reagent as specified. 02- Development of Vibrio spp. reagent as specified. 03- Development of Staphylococcus aureus reagent as specified. This is a level of effort term item in accordance with FAR 16.207. After successful product development there will be an IDIQ portion to the contract. The government will require delivery for the reagents to multiple locations, on multiple dates over a one year period. IDIQ 01 Campylobacter spp. reagent as specified. Minimum quantity 750 IDIQ 02 Vibrio spp. reagent as specified. Minimum quantity 600 IDIQ 03 Staphylococcus aureus reagent as specified. Minimum quantity 600 The solicitation will be awarded based on best value (FAR 15.101-1); therefore, proposals will be evaluated on technical merit, cost effectiveness and past performance. Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3. Technical/management and past performance when combined are approximately equal in importance to cost or price in determining the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>1-Technical/Management Criteria:</p>
<p>a. Product sample to demonstrate successful product development. This shall be accomplished by one of two methods. ---weight 40%<br />(1) by providing a workable sample of each product development reagent that can cytometrically detect and count each of the three target pathogens while meeting relevant inclusivity, exclusivity, competitive, linearity, and quantitative detection limit criteria, as well as the capacity to exclude food matrix signal interference for food products with which each target pathogen is commonly associated (e.g. - Campylobacter in pork, Vibrio in seafood, Staphylococcus in raw milk); or <br />(2) show the technical capability to develop such products, by providing a workable reagent that can cytometrically detect within four hours one cell of a typical food-borne gram negative or gram positive bacterium in two of the following food matrices.<br />1. a leafy green vegetable. <br />2. hamburger<br />3. peanut butter<br />4. chili peppers.</p>
<p>b. Demonstrate ability and understanding of the Scope of Work.---Weight 30%<br />(i) Technical approach and work plan to accomplish the development of the target bacteria reagents.<br />(ii) Offeror/management commitment in development of novel reagents for food analysis by flow cytometry.</p>
<p>c. Demonstrate technical experience of projects of similar size, scope <br />and complexity.-Weight 30%<br />(i) The proposed staffing plan and the qualifications and experience of proposed personnel will be evaluated for relevancy to the work to be performed. <br />(ii) Prior Corporate experience performed during the last 3 years will be evaluated for relevancy - the degree to which the prior projects are similar in size, scope and complexity.</p>
<p><br />2-Past Performance</p>
<p>a. How well the offeror has performed on previous projects of similar size, scope and complexity.<br />(i) Projects that have been completed in the last 3 years.</p>
<p>Offerors will be evaluated on how well they have performed on previous projects of similar size, scope, and complexity. Projects must have been completed in the last 3 years.<br />The Government's evaluation of the offeror's past performance shall be a subjective assessment based upon information supplied by the offeror in response to this solicitation. The Government may also utilize information, which may be available from a variety of other public and private sources that have useful and relevant information. This criterion will include, but is not necessarily limited to, factors such as:<br />&bull; Quality of Service <br />&bull; Timeliness of Performance<br />&bull; Price Control <br />&bull; Business Relations</p>
<p>- The Past Performance Factor evaluation will assess the relevance and breadth of the Offeror's experience and the quality of the Offeror's past performance at satisfying its customers. The Government is seeking to determine whether the Offeror consistently delivers quality services in a timely and cost effective manner. Only recent experience within the last three (3) years will be considered in this evaluation.</p>
<p><br />Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and shall be rated neutral on Factor 2 - Past Performance.</p>
<p>Offerors will be ranked based on the responses to the past performance questionnaires received from their references, as well as information obtained from any other sources. Offerors past performance will be assigned a pass rating, neutral rating or a fail rating based on the past performance scores.</p>

<DESC>General Information:

Bid Bond for this project is required to be 20%

The following non-technical questions have been asked:

1. Are teaming agreements acceptable?  
ANSWER: Yes, but it must be clear that the Small Business is the prominent partner. Any protests filed over business size will be settled by the SBA. 

2. Should or can teaming agreements be approved prior to bid by you or your staff? If so do you have an acceptable format? 
ANSWER: We do not have not a standard format.  See #1 above. 

3. The prime contractor being a small business is likely to team with a larger contractor. May the larger contractor provide guarantees to the surety to facilitate bonding for the small business (prime contractor)? The bond would be issued in the name of the small business (prime contractor).  
ANSWER: As you have stated the bonds and insurances must be in the Small Business name.  Any other arrangements are strictly between the Surety and the Contractor. 

4. Are the bonds for the awarded contractor to be 100% bonds or will a lesser amount be accepted? 
ANSWER: Bid bond must be 20%, payment and construction bonds must be 100%. 

5. The small business is required to perform 15% of the total contract value, but can apply for a lesser amount after the bid if the contracting officer feels it is to the benefit of the government to do so. The composition of the 15% can that be any combination of Labor, Material, Equipment, Overhead, and Profit?  
ANSWER: The Government will not entertain anything less than 15% for these projects.

6. It is understood that the Government is seeking the most competitive, responsible bid(s) for these projects. It is further understood that by combining bid options and multiple projects, the Government should recognize the best combined costs from Contractors, Subcontractors and Vendors, in theory, the more work bid on as a package the more competitive the price will be based on the overall volume of work. In the spirit of this approach, we want to provide our most competitive bid. We are wondering if in our bid(s) we can “bundle” some of our General Conditions costs.
ANSWER: The Government cannot tell you how to put your proposals together.  We can state that the solicitations and bidding combinations were put together in recognition of the economies offered by multiple contracts that you stated in your question.

PLEASE NOTE:  The due date for submission for full proposals is 12:00 noon ET, June 9, 2009.  Please be reminded of the importance of logging onto the system early to allow ample time to register, fill out the cover sheet, upload the volumes, and to submit the proposal.  This may take up to 20 minutes total.  Proposal submission is accomplished by clicking the "yes, finalize" button.  The system will allow log on anytime before 12:00 noon ET, and one can also submit using the "yes, finalize" button even after the deadline, but the proposal would not be acceptable as it would be late.  As stated in the RFP section 7.4, late proposals will not be considered.  For that reason offerors must submit using the “yes, finalize” button before the deadline.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) hereby issues a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Modernization of Federal Office Building 8, 200 C Street SW, Washington DC. The awarded contract shall be one firm fixed price contract (Subject to Availability of Funds) consisting of a base bid construction plus one option and one "deductive alternate" (Subject to Availability of Funds).  GSA anticipates that funding will be used from the pending FY 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. 
This renovation is being designed in metric units and the building is approximately 51,125 gross square meters (550,307 gross square feet). The selected General Contractor will become a member of the project team during construction, working with GSA, GSA's already under contract AE firm, and other GSA consultants.  The scope of the project includes partial demolition, base building construction and tenant fit-out. During construction, the contractor shall ensure that the existing chilled water plant, which feeds an adjacent occupied building, operates without interruption. GSA will continue to maintain this system throughout the construction performance period.  The contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, material, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided) and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet GSA and client agency requirements.  The contractor will perform the construction in accordance with the design specifications, drawings and terms and conditions of the contract.  The estimated construction cost range including tenant fit-out is between $120 - $130 million.  The Construction Performance Period shall not exceed 1,095 calendar days after issuance of the Notice to Proceed. This timeframe includes tenant buildout. Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3. along final occupancy being expected to commence April 2012.   
The selection process will use tradeoffs and technical/management factors are more important than price and price related factors. The Factors are Experience (25%), Past Performance (25%), Project Management Plan (10%), Corporate Approach (5%), Key Personnel (25%), and Apprenticeship Plan (10%).

The Offerors must demonstrate past experience providing construction services in the capacity of a tradition General Contractor (GC) on at least two (2) similar projects with at least one (1) project of a value higher than $50M. The Offerors must provide documentation and confirmation of past performance on the projects identified by the offeror under the past experience factor.   The offeror must provide a Project Management Plan that conveys the Offeror's intended planning tools for achieving project success in terms of scope, timeliness and quality  (to include a Subcontracting Plan and Quality Control Plan as well).  The Government will also evaluate the Offeror's Corporate Approach though the Offeror's summary of its management style regarding personnel and staffing plan, along with evaluate the qualifications of key personnel on the Offeror's project team.  The Offeror shall promote the growth of skilled craft labor, specifically the contractor's use of a registered apprenticeship program. (As used herein, the term "registered apprenticeship program" is a program that is registered with the United States Department of Labor or State Apprenticeship Council under 29 CFR Part 29.).  Technical, when combined, is significantly more important than cost and price. 
The selected General Contractor will become a member of the project team during construction, working with GSA, GSA's already under contract AE firm, and other GSA consultants as well as shall maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project. The General Contractor will be required to assign a project management team as required by the RFP. Construction Services shall include, but are not limited to, renovation and conversion of the building in accordance with the specifications, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, maintaining of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, total building "commissioning" and turnover to designated facility management staff, and other required supplemental services as requested by GSA. During contract performance, the General Contractor shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, means to achieve the best value in performance, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas including value engineer, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting. The General Contractor shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration. Most importantly, the General Contractor shall have complete responsibility for renovation and conversion of the facility.  
This negotiated procurement will be open to both large and small business firms. The firm (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and woman-owned small business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507, as part of its proposal.  The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>This is a modification to an existing contract task order. The Kansas City District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded the task order modification using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds on contract task order W912DQ-08-D-0017-0004, Modification 03. The project was originally competed under solicitation number W912DQ-08-R-0048 and awarded to Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. (CAGE code: 0NYX3). This is a remedial design task order modification. This work completes investigations, remedial designs and related studies for the Welsbach/General Gas Mantle Superfund Site at Camden and Gloucester City, New Jersey.<BR><BR>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Government posts this award notice of modification to an existing Task Order for investigation and design activities at the Welsbach/General Gas Mantle Superfund Site located in Camden and Gloucester City, New Jersey.  A Cost Plus Fixed-Fee modification to an existing Task Order was used under Contract W912DQ-08-D-0017, which was competitively awarded.  The modification award was $6,000,000.<BR><BR>The objective of this remediation project is to remove radiological contaminated soil and material and restore the site to pre-existing conditions.  This will require radiological investigations, monitoring and design preparations.  <BR><BR>Procurement of a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee modification to the existing Task Order will offer significant flexibility for responding to contaminant conditions that are not well defined at the start of the project.   Additionally, the USACE Welsbach/GGM project team is capable and prepared to provide qualified staff for monitoring contractor performance to mitigate risks and to ensure that all alternatives have been considered.  The project team is also able and has experience to monitor the task order to ensure that performance, cost and schedule goals are being met, including but not limited to: implementing quality assurance procedures established for the contract, and completing timely contractor performance evaluations that accurately reflect the contractors actual performance. <BR>
