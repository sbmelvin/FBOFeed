<p>1. How many awardees would be recommended for this MATOC? Please note that there will be restricted layout areas for each project and both single and aggregate bonding issues should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>2. Would Industry prefer a single phase selection or a two phase selection in this procurement knowing that the first task order is likely to be the a project that has a magnitude of construction of $100M to $250M.</p>
<p>3. How would Industry like to see us select the awardees? What are your ideas on the pricing mechanism? The evaluation criteria?</p>

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>
