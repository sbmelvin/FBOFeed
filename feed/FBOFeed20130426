<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-13-01703 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.

<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the procurement of Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) System Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) support.
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government will nominate to the bidders list only those firms that 1) are pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 2) hold a current SECRET level facility security clearance. In addition, performance of the contract will require that contractor personnel working on the project hold SECRET personnel security clearances. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NCIA the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-13550-BMD.&nbsp;<br /><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The purpose of the SE&amp;I contract is to procure the technical expertise to execute the tasks and produce the associated deliverables necessary to support the NCIA's BMD Program Office in achieving and delivering a NATO BMD capability. This work consists of review and revision of system specifications, configuration control of those specifications, and integration and testing in support of implementation activities. The NATO capability will be composed of NATO Command, Control, and Communications (C3) Systems components, and the NATO sensors and National sensors, interceptor and C3 systems that are expected to be provided by the nations and that will be linked to NATO Battle Management, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (BMC3I). The contractor will support the development and integration of the NATO C3 systems, and the design, development, and testing of the interfaces of these systems to NATO and National weapons and sensors. Please see the attached Summary of Requirement for more information.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the NATO member governments nominate to the bidders list potential prime contractors that are located within their borders. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. firm to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application): 24 May 2013<br /><br />- IFB planned to be issued in July 2013</p>
<p>- Bid Closing planned for October 2013</p>
<p>- Contract Award anticipated in March 2014</p>

<SUBJECT>ALS Outreach and Education Activities to Support the National ALS Registry

<RESPDATE>051213
<CONTACT>Abby L. Martin, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704883221, Email wzo7@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, intends to award a sole source fixed price contract to the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) located at 3300 E. Sunrise Drive, Tucson, AZ 85718 for outreach and educational activities to MDA's patient base and ALS community partners to support the National ALS Registry. The period of performance for this procurement is sixty (60) months, including one (1) base year plus four (4) option years. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1(a) - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, with a size standard of $14M. <br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to promote the National ALS Registry by increasing ALS patient enrollment numbers through the MDA's extensive nationwide network of offices, clinics and Centers of Excellence as well as its other partnerships and relationships in the greater ALS community so that CDC/ATSDR can fulfill the congressional mandate under the ALS Registry Act, Public Law No. 110-373.
<p>The most direct way to reach the critical majority of ALS patients is to conduct outreach in the clinics, centers, and offices where ALS patients are being treated and supported. As a leading healthcare provider of ALS treatment, support, advocacy and education in the United States supporting almost 40% of the ALS-identified patients, MDA's nationwide network of clinics, offices, and Centers of Excellence offers assistance to a large number of ALS patients and their families, along with supporting the local ALS clinical community. MDA's very large and unique ALS patient cohort located throughout the United States provides MDA with sole and exclusive proprietary access to these patients, their medical records and their contact information. This information is protected by medical privilege and not commercially available in the marketplace, so only MDA has access to its specific nationwide client base of ALS patients. &nbsp;MDA's established relationship of trust and confidence with its ALS patients and their families places MDA in a unique position to provide ATSDR with substantial assistance in promoting the National ALS Registry to MDA's ALS constituents (e.g., ALS patients, their family members and caregivers, and ALSA clinical staff). MDA is the sole source to access the MDA-ALS patient/family cohort and no other contractor can provide this service to meet the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>MDA's stellar work and efforts in the treatment, cure, advocacy and education related to ALS have earned it tremendous respect and credibility in the field of ALS throughout the entire ALS Community. MDA has thus cultivated, fostered and developed an extensive network of professional relationships and partnerships with others in the general ALS community over the years, regularly engaging ALS physicians and other ALS health professionals and MDA clinics throughout the country. These relationships provide outreach, education, support, and assistance to people with ALS patients, their families, and the local ALS clinical community beyond the MDA ALS-patient cohort.</p>
<p>ATSDR needs MDA's relationships, links, knowledge, experience, patients and community support to fulfill ATSDR's congressional mandate to build the National ALS Registry as provided for in the ALS Registry Act, Public Law No. 110-373. With access to its ALS patients and community network, MDA will help CDC/ATSDR narrow a significant data gap in the National ALS Registry, thus ensuring the objectives of this national public health ALS initiative are fully met.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA). However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Abby L. Martin via email ONLY at wzo7@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2013-N-57284 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN May 12, 2013, Noon EST. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was created as an independent Agency by Congress in 1974 to enable the nation to safely use radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while ensuring that people and the environment are protected. The NRC regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials, such as in nuclear medicine, through licensing, inspection, and enforcement of its requirements. The NRC's headquarters are in Rockville, Maryland, and there are a number of other offices around the United States.
<p>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform Design Engineering Inspections. In accordance with the baseline inspection portion of the Reactor Oversight Process (ROP), the NRC inspects the design and operation of nuclear power reactor plants. These inspections sometimes require contractor technical support.</p>
<p>Component Design Bases Inspections (CDBIs) are the primary inspection under this contract. They verify that design bases have been correctly implemented for the selected risk-significant components and that operating procedures and operator actions are consistent with design and licensing bases. This ensures that selected components are capable of performing their safety functions.</p>
<p>In addition to CDBIs, contract technical support may be required for other inspections of design and operations including (but not limited to): fire protection; plant modifications; supplemental inspections at plants which experience degraded performance; reactive inspections (such as augmented inspection teams and special Inspections); independent design verification programs; and integrated design inspections.</p>
<p>Since 1982, the NRC has had various design engineering inspection programs that required contractor assistance to supplement staff resources. These have included integrated design inspections (IDIs), safety system functional inspections (SSFIs), electrical distribution system functional inspections (EDSFIs), service water system operational performance inspections, safety systems design and performance capability (SSDPC), fire protection inspections, and CDBIs.</p>
<p>The NRC has found it beneficial to form inspection teams including contractors with current nuclear plant experience. These inspections usually start with design requirements, and follow the plant implementation through plant operations and maintenance practices.</p>
<p>The resulting contract is expected to be an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract. The expected period of performance is a base period of three years with two additional one-year periods.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition Operations, Technology Acquisition center (TAC), located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, NJ, intends to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for the Office of Information Technology (OIT).  The TAC intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to Remote-Learner, 201 Osage Lane, Suite 2, Waynesboro, Virginia, 22980 for ongoing and extended Moodle hosting and managed support services in support of existing and upcoming VA educational content.

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                       Office of Acquisition Operations
                                       Technology Acquisition Center
                                       260 Industrial Way West
                                       Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2. Description of Action: The proposed action is for a 3-month Firm-Fixed Price contract, with two, 1-month options, to avoid a break in the Office of Research and Development (ORD) Support Services for the Research and Development (R&D) Initiative with Veterans Enterprise Technology Solutions, Inc. (VETS). 

3. Description of Supplies or Services: The Office of Information and Technology provides customer service support for the ORD as part of the Secretary's Major Initiatives, specifically the R&D Initiative.  This support includes upgrades and maintenance of several proprietary software applications, as well as the analysis of software architecture design at 115 VA facilities nationwide.  The proposed action will provide continued support to bridge the gap between the expiration of the existing agreement and the award of the follow-on action being competed under VA's Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology (T4) contract.  REDACTED                                      

4. Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 U.S.C.3304 (a)(5), "Authorized or Required by Statute", as implemented by FAR 6.302-5.  For this action, 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), known as the Veterans First Contracting Program provides the authority to directly contract with a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  

5. Reason for Authority Cited: The proposed source for this action is VETS, 367 Triple C Drive, Clarksville, VA 23927, a registered and verified SDVOSB in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database.  VA is planning to award a new competitive Task Order under T4, in the coming months, for all the services that are currently supported by VETS.  A short-term contract with VETS needs to be executed to ensure there is no disruption to the services prior to the new T4 award.  VETS is uniquely qualified to provide the required bridge services as it is currently performing this support with fully trained staff in place. The systems that require the support services are unique to VA ORD. VETS possesses the application knowledge and technical expertise required to support this project. In light of the above, the Government's technical experts have determined that VETS is capable of meeting all of the Government's requirements and is considered a responsible SDVOSB.  If VA competed this bridge requirement, any other source would require a project "ramp up" time for onboarding and knowledge transferring which would take approximately 5 months and will result in a break of service. The facilities where these services are performed require the onboarding processes to be completed and a Personal Identity Verification card to be issued before access is granted to the secure site. As stated in the market research section below, delays in background investigations are common. If another vendor is selected for this bridge effort, additional risk would be incurred as the new contractor's staff will not fully understand the intent and context of the complex requirements included in the subject support services and by the time they were up to speed, it would be time to transition the services, yet again, to the T4 awardee. The Government's Technical Experts have determined that another contractor could not complete these processes and still provide substantial benefit to the Government during this period.

6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted and the details are contained in the market research section below.  While other SDVOSB contractors are capable of performing similar work, this effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements in the timeframe required. Consistent with the guidelines of the Veterans First Contracting Program, the proposed action shall be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website in accordance with FAR Part 5.

7. Actions to Increase Competition: No barriers to future competition are anticipated. A competitive Task Order is anticipated to be awarded by September 2013 on T4 and future acquisitions will be awarded on a competitive basis.

8. Market Research: REDACTED

9. Other Facts: The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that this proposed action meets all the requirements of the statute 38 U.S.C 8127(c).  This procurement is below the $5,000,000 threshold, VETS is a responsible SDVOSB, and a fair and reasonable price will offer a best value to the Government.

<p>NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Request For Information (RFI) to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541330, Engineering Services, Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons which has a corresponding size standard of $35.5M. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hub zone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming arrangements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Air Force is seeking potential contractors who are interested in providing engineering services to the A-10 System Program Office (SPO). This notification is a request for information to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, data or data-rights, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for the A-10 SPO at Hill Air Force Base, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid. To be considered as a potential source for this requirement, a Contractor will be required to submit data in response to the future solicitation, verifying capabilities to meet the requirements on solicitation. The contractor is requested to respond to this RFI as identified in the "Responses" section of this RFI. Based on the "Notes" section of this RFI, it shall not be construed that the Government for contractor responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The A-10 SPO is the primary integrator for all modifications and sustainment changes for the weapon system and the current and anticipated dynamic battlefield environments drive many modernization and sustainment changes to the A-10 legacy aircraft, creating unique requirements to maintain the A-10 throughout its life cycle. Modifications affecting all A-10 functional areas and interfaces to include mechanical, structural, electrical, avionics, weapons, support equipment and operational flight programs (OFP), continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace. <br />Starting with the A-10 Wing Replacement Program (WRP), the A-10 SPO has implemented Siemens Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) products for configuration and control of 3D models and all associated technical data. The currently owned and used products are the basic TeamCenter Configuration Management Module and the TeamCenter In-service (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO)) module. As a result of the success on the WRP, the A-10 SPO is expanding the use of Siemens PLM technology and processes for other elements and lifecycle processes of the A-10 aircraft. The A-10 WRP TeamCenter Steering Committee has developed an implementation outline including such capabilities to include but not limited to additional functionality for engineering, interfaces with USAF systems, support for commodities, supplier interaction, and depot support. As the use of TeamCenter PLM technology and processes spreads beyond the WRP's current release, a more detailed implementation strategy, roadmap and plan is required. This plan needs to consider and dovetail with the Air Force PLM Initiative (PLMi) strategy plan, the A-10 SPO realignment with Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Fighters and Bombers Program Executive Office (PEO) and the Siemens PLM product roadmap. A-10 SPO requires support to develop and execute such an implementation strategy, roadmap, and plan.<br />The goal of the new A-10 SPO Process, System Design and Implementation Support services is threefold: <br />a. Refine/Develop a Strategy and Implementation Plan for the continual improvement and expansion of the current TeamCenter environment for configuration management across the rest of the weapon system.<br />b. Refine/Develop, map and document standard logistics and engineering processes and procedures and their information technology interfaces for the sustainment of the A-10 in the AF inventory.<br />c. Further develop standard engineering processes and policy (tools, templates and training) for efficient future acquisition and sustainment of the A-10 aircraft.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>This effort is to acquire engineering services to identify new and developing technologies that can support the accomplishment of A-10 missions and either eliminate or minimize operational and/or sustainability gaps. The Contractor will have to perform integrated systems engineering to deconflict and integrate A-10 baselines, architecture, programs and processes. These include the necessary tools, templates and training for efficient future acquisition and sustainment of the A-10 aircraft. Specific tasks include the provision of a deconfliction matrix, updates, integration and support of products, views or documents called out in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), the analysis for the Support Equipment Roadmap, baseline maintenance, A-10 Weapon System Management Environment (AWSME) maintenance, TeamCenter software support, and configuration technical support . The Contractor must obtain applied knowledge of current Air Force Systems and maintenance engineering processes, as well as logistics management best practices using ERP/APS processes in governmental agencies. Additional knowledge specifically related to Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force logistics goals, objectives, and current practices is also required. The Contractor must be familiar with the DoD Architecture Framework (DODAF) 2.0, as well as the documents listed in the Appendices of the PWS.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT SURVEY ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTE, OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. <br>  <br> The Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the titled project above. <br>  <br> Project Description: Construction of an approximately 173,085 gross square foot Conference Center and Dormitories. The project requires the construction of a state-of-the-art conference center and dormitories, and associated site work and utilities infrastructure.  There are high level finishes required and tiered FFE packages to complete the fit-out and furnishing of the facility. <br>  <br> This project will be design/bid/build, using NAICS Code: 236220 - Construction of Buildings, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The magnitude of construction for this project is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. Small Business contractors must perform 20% of the work. The estimated period of performance is 365 days. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement as described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).   <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy states: Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.  Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law.  Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, and Clause: FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLAs per FAR 22.503 (c) are: <br>  <br> Does the project require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades? <br>  <br> Is there is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited? <br>  <br> Will completion of the project require an extended period of time? <br>  <br> Have project labor agreements been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of the project? <br>  <br> Will a project labor agreement promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs? <br>  <br> Are there any other factors that the Corps should consider? <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> 1.	Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind?  If so, please provide supporting documentation? <br>  <br> 2.	Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project?  If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. <br>  <br> 3.	Are you aware of any past or current labor strikes or disputes that would directly impact the consideration of a PLA on the referenced project?   If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. <br>  <br> 4.	 Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed?  If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. <br>  <br> 5.	Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.   <br>  <br> 6.	Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. <br>    <br> 7.	Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA for the referenced project. <br>  <br> 8.	Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA for the referenced project. <br>  <br> The construction community is invited to answer and comment on the use of a PLA for the above titled project. <br>  <br> Responses shall be submitted via email to Mr. Kevin Cook at Kevin.j.Cook@usace.army.mil no later than X p.m. (EST) on XX April 2013.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey. <br>

BACKGROUND:  Hydration assessment is a key component for the prevention and proper treatment of fluid and electrolyte imbalances during warfighter training and fighting, particularly in extreme environments such as Iraq and Afghanistan.  Dehydration is one of the fundamental physiological mechanisms of extreme environment-related illness and injury.  Dehydration degrades work capabilities and increases the risk of life-threatening heat illness, seizures and brain damage.  Over aggressive re-hydration can cause serious health problems such as hyponatremia.  Debilitating performance and health consequences of dehydration and hyponatremia could be exploited by an aggressive enemy.  Despite the critical importance of proper fluid balance to warfighter performance and health, no valid, reliable, and field-expedient test currently exists for assessing hydration status.   The commercial test shall be a simple hand-held device similar to the home pregnancy test.   This device can be suitable for home and field use, and shall deliver results in minutes at a fraction of costs associated with the standard blood test.   <br>  <br> 4.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Agilent Technologies Incorporated, 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95051. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 811219, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>The FBI Laboratory has a requirement for a one year maintenance agreement for its Agilent Robot. The Agilent system owned by the FBI fulfills the requirement to process the increased DNA samples being sent to the Federal DNA Database Unit for processing. To ensure this system is available and operating to fulfill the FCO and FBI Law Enforcement Support missions, the establishment of a preventive maintenance agreement is extremely critical in nature.</p>
<p>Agilent Technologies Incorporated is the manufactured of the FBI owned robot and service performed by someone other than Agilent would invalidate Agilent warranties. Agilent is the sole source for factory recommended replacement parts, Agilent's Proprietary software updates; Agilent factory authorized service representatives, and Agilent's proprietary factory recommended upgrades.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by Agilent Technologies, as no other vendor is capable of providing the Agilent Seal that is needed for direct support of the FBI's mission.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 08:00 am, EST, by April 30, 2013, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov.

MARKET RESEARCH: The Government is seeking information from vendors of command and control (C2) software for multisensor persistent surveillance systems.  The C2 software will need to manage a distributed persistent surveillance system consisting of multiple networked operator posts and multisensor nodes.
  Each multisensor node will consist of several sensors such as EO/IR sensors, SWIR sensor, ground surveillance radar (GSR) sensor, SAASM-compliant GPS, north-finding sensor, a means of target geolocation such as a laser rangefinder, connectivity to remote unattended ground sensors (UGS), unmanned aircraft system (UAS) video feed receiver, special-purpose sensors, and so forth.  Each operator post shall be able to control, as well as receive/view the output of all the sensors located on all of the networked multisensor nodes.
At a minimum the C2 software should include the following features:
A plug-and-play type of adaptability with respect to the addition of supported sensors
Operator sensor selection for viewing, configuration, and control
Sensor selection contention control among multiple operator posts
Auto-discovery of new operator posts
Comprehensive operator interactive map/Geographic Information System (GIS) display of terrain, landmarks, targets, areas of regard and fields of view (FOV) for individual sensors, areas in/out of defilade, and so forth, utilizing standard military symbology/icons,  with both latitude/longitude and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) coordinates  
Contact (target) detection coupled with information generation, map display, data storage, and data retrieval
Ability to geolocate and geoemplace contacts
Semiautomatic sensor slew-to-cue triggered by operator(s) manually generated/entered contacts

Chat ability between operator posts with GIS functions integrated
Ability to comply with DoD information assurance certification and accreditation requirements; specific identification of which interoperability and sensor interface standards are supported.
Submission of information regarding additional C2 software features is encouraged.
  These additional features may include but should not be limited to:
Improved/augmented/semi-automatic sensor slew-to-cue control by operator; e.g., via cursor on map or via cursor on full motion video display
Automatic contact tracking
Clutter control; operator-settable false-positive rejection filter
Contact feature extraction and classification/recognition
Generation of a common representational format among multiple sensors
Situation/threat assessment
Advance sensor automatic control algorithms
System database mining and knowledge discovery
Improved or more flexible approaches to inter-node/operator post networking
Approaches to reducing operator overload/fatigue
Ability of operator to customize GUI per mission demands

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to focus attention of the scientific community on current warfighter decision making needs for Proactive Decision Support (PDS) tools, and the development of theories and models that would enable a science of Context-Driven Decision Making (CDDM). The Command Decision Making program (CDM) will pursue basic and applied research to develop algorithms, methods, techniques and strategies for modeling missions, tasks and operational context in order to dynamically anticipate a warfighters information needs, and then present information to enable the decision maker to make better decisions, faster than they would without PDS.
<p><br />The Command Decision Making (CDM) program is seeking to invest in basic and applied research that aims to mitigate the challenges faced by today's decision makers. The purpose of this topic is to identify, understand, and resolve key issues, develop and mature algorithms and methods; determine and demonstrate performance of algorithms, methods, techniques, and strategies for automated computational methods and information systems that support decision making. At the center of this new research initiative is the idea that existing or newly developed algorithms and applied to create a context awareness of decision makers' missions and tasks. Given dynamic algorithms of context that are sufficient to understand missions and tasks (i.e. goal driven behavior) it will then be possible to develop and demonstrate PDS tools that will anticipate the decision and information needs of decision makers. This will enable decision makers to effectively address operational complexity and make more optimal decisions, faster. The result of this effort will be algorithms, methods, techniques, and strategies that would be a basis for a Science of Context-Driven Decision Making (CDDM) and the development of practical Proactive Decision Support (PDS) tools.</p>
<p>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for the CDM program. Proposals should address the requirements for science that would address the mechanisms for Context Driven Decision Making, and technologies that would enable the development of Proactive Decision Support tools. The general interest is in innovative science and technology to model/infer the user's decision making behavior, to enable a utility-based exploitation of information needed to support those decisions, as well as the active modeling of "decision trajectories " so as to provide time critical information supporting anticipated decisions. The active modeling of context related to tasks is expected to be a significant research problem that will contribute to the development of proactive decision support. It is expected that this research and development effort will demonstrate significant operational impact on the achievement of mission objectives and goals.</p>

<DESC>The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to solicit constructive responses from industry about the Measurement and Payment structure for the Harlan County Spillway Stoplog contract.  Complete contractual requirements will be issued when the solicitation is advertised.  Harlan County Dam is located in Southwestern Nebraska. <br> SOW: <br> The work includes fabrication of spillway dewatering structures, mobilization and installation of those structures on the upstream surface of Harlan County dam, installation of anchors and grout pad, construction of a concrete slab on grade (Contractor Design) and incidental related work.   <br> The contract Base considers the installation of the anchors and structural components (Support Beam, Guides, Stoplogs, nuts and washers) will occur in  quote mark dry quote mark  conditions (e.g. from a barge or roadway above).  Options are included to cover additional work associated with installation of anchors or structural components by divers. <br> Before an option is exercised to permit work associated with diving, the contractor will be required to submit two specification submittals for approval.  The first submittal occurs when the water surface elevation is within 24 inches of the row of anchors to be installed (or other work).  The first submittal requires the contractor to propose an underwater pre-production anchor installation test for divers that will install anchors.  Anchor installers will be required to have ACI/CRSI Adhesive Anchor Installer Certification.  Pre-production anchors must be tested and approved prior to an installer installing production anchors.  The second submittal occurs when the water surface elevation is within 12 inches of the row of anchors to be installed.  The second submittal requires the contractor to show the lake elevation, forecast, and necessity for diving to install anchors. <br> Harlan County Lake water surface elevations will not be lowered or regulated for work contained in the contract.  The anchor locations are near normal lake elevations.  Should diving be required, it is anticipated to be shallow dives (i.e. less than 12 ft).  There are over 2,500 ASTM F593 all-thread anchor bars to be installed in the contract. <br> Proposed Measurement and Payment Option for dive work associated with anchor installation: <br> 3.5 Bid Item No. 0005 (OPTION): DIVE CREW MOB/DEMOB <br>  <br> 3.5.1 Payment <br> 							 <br>   Payment will be made for costs associated with the following items: <br> Mobilization and demobilization to the project site of the dive crew as well as all necessary equipment & materials. Not to exceed 3 each per CLIN. The combination of a mobilization and a demobilization will be counted as 1 each. <br>  <br> 3.6 Bid Item No. 0006 (OPTION): ADDITIONAL COST FOR DIVE CREW WORK		 <br>  <br> 3.6.1 Measurement <br>  <br>   Measurement for payment will be based upon the following: If dive work is required, then in addition to work associated with routine dive activities, a minimum of one of the following is required to be completed during the 1 week (5 days/wk; 10 hrs/day) that the CLIN is exercised in order to receive full payment for dive work:  <br> a)	150 anchors drilled and installed underwater or <br> b) Complete installation of 5 pier guides, 4 support beams, & 16 stoplogs; and leak test if directed by the COR <br> 3.6.2 Payment <br>  <br>   Payment will be made for costs associated with the item listed below: <br> Additional cost to dry installation for work by dive crew on a per week basis not to exceed 3 weeks per CLIN. If the contractor is unable to complete the required work during the 1 week (5 days/wk; 10 hrs/day) period, then payment will be prorated accordingly. For example, if 100 anchors were completed during the week then Contractor will receive two-thirds of the full payment amount. <br> Inquiries for Industry: <br> 1.	 Is it possible to bid this Option with the CLIN structure shown?  Explain alternatives. <br>  <br> 2.	Are the productivity requirements of installing 150 anchors in a 5 day week, 10 hr day, reasonable?  Explain alternatives. <br>  <br> 3.	 List any concerns with and alternatives to having the dive crew deploy to the site for the pre-production test anchorage, demob, and then again mob to the site a few weeks later to install production anchors. <br>  <br> 4.	Is the following alternative reasonable and economical?

<DESC>The Department of the Army, Healthcare Acquisition Activity- North intends to negotiate a Sole Source commercial item procurement with Sirona Dental Systems to provide a CAD/CAM System Upgrade. The system will include CEREC InLab MCXL Milling Unit and H&W Radio upgrade.  This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than May 3rd  noon local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Michele Devine, Contract Specialist, e-mail: michele.g.devine.ctr@mail.mil  <br>  <br> The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6). <br>  <br> Cerec CAD/CAM Systems are the only system that mills porcelain, ceramic, leucite ceramic, composites, zirconia, acrylic, polyurethane, metal, zirconia abutments, full contour zirconia, metal and zirconia understructures, wax patterns, models and crown templates. They offer a full scale digital network for restorative procedures. The milling machine will significantly reduce fabrication time. The system allows the dentist to prepare a tooth for a complex restoration, mill the permanent crown, and cement it all in one appointment. The base currently has a CEREC  system so the new system will be compatible with existing components.  <br> The sole source will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays due to the government. Chair side intraoral scanners create digital impressions of patients teeth and sends them directly to an in-office milling machine thereby reducing fabrication time and increasing productivity.  <br>

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Directed Energy Division, Optical Radiation Bioeffects Branch (711 HPW/RHDO) is unique in the Department of Defense because it brings together in one organization the physical, biological, behavioral science and engineering disciplines with specialized facilities to address most aspects of the human response with optical sources in Air Force combat operations. Due to this laboratory's focus on man as an intrinsic part of the weapon system, the laboratory is often tasked from other customers to evaluate the human aspects of their systems. Collaboration through Optical Radiation Bioeffects and Safety (ORBS) contract, AFRL must respond with technical solutions and programs that address the customer's technical requirements. Optical radiation technologies, with potentially serious hazards to aircrews, are being incorporated in many operational systems. Beyond today's target designator, rangefinder, and beam-rider systems are dedicated laser systems capable of jamming and damaging both eyes and sensors. These systems have potential serious consequences for air missions, special forces operations, and security of high-value targets in both US and allied countries. In turn, similar systems can be utilized to enhance the warfighters'/peacekeepers' flexibility by allowing them to respond with non-lethal methods.
<p>In conjunction with the ORBS contract, 711 HPW/RHDO and Project Reliance Units (Army Medical Research Detachment and Naval Medical Research Unit) perform basic research, exploratory and advanced development, and evaluation of protection to understand, mitigate, and exploit effects of optical radiation (ultraviolet, visible, infrared) devices and their countermeasures on DoD personnel and aerospace missions. 711 HPW/RHDO conducts research that advances the state of the art in understanding the interactions of optical radiation with biological systems; provides safety and protection consultation services to operational units and acquisition offices; establishes design specifications for systems developers; develops, and transitions personnel protection devices for occupational, and operational applications; and extends DoD capabilities in modeling and simulation of personnel susceptibility and mission planning involving directed energy (DE) weapons. Our Project Reliance colleagues explore technologies for: diagnosis and treatment of combat injuries due to optical radiation; improved methods of combat casualty care, including triage, diagnosis and treatment; and simulating laser injury to assess mission performance. Finally, 711 HPW/RHDO recommends new DoD and national safety standards for both laser and broadband sources, and participates in the creation and review of optical radiation safety standards (for both laser and broadband sources). See BAA Solicitation and Attachments for the Technical Areas and details for this effort . Also, note in the BAA solicitation, the due date and time proposals are due at both locations at their local time, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, and Ft Sam Houston TX.</p>

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Douglas Lowrey, at douglas.lowrey@us.army.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:<br />(ii) price <br />Basis for award: The award will be made to the vendor whose quotation represents the best value to the government. As allowed by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1), the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive that reflects a complete understanding of the Salient Characteristics and represents the best value to the Government based on selection of the technically acceptable quotation with the lowest evaluated price. The best value is represented by the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required. The technical area will be evaluated on an -acceptable&#8214; or -unacceptable&#8214; basis. Only those quotations determined to be technically acceptable will be evaluated on price. If the quotation received is determined to be unacceptable, the vendor will be excluded from competition and will not be considered for award. <br />(c) A purchase order, mailed or otherwise furnished to the vendor shall result in a binding contract upon receipt of written acknowledgement by the vendor or commencement of performance.<br />NOTE: In accordance with FAR 13.004, the following information regarding quotations is provided: <br />Legal Effect of Quotations <br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer. <br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred. <br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

The purpose of this effort is not primarily to develop deployable Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) software packages to the CND community, but to develop/enhance scripts (similar to macros) that will reside on Government servers at centralized locations that will pull from existing Government databases and various log files, to perform analysis of architecture to determine threats and proposed data collection and aggregation, and work with CND analysts to improve detection of attacks against the DOD Global Information Grid.

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611. <br /><br />The objective of this task order is to obtain evaluation support services from a qualified independent consulting firm (firm or contractor) to the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Corporation for National and Community Service (Corporation or CNCS) during the performance period from May 15, 2013 to July 30, 2013. The primary objective of this contract is to secure the services of a consultant/contractor to conduct an evaluation of the Corporation's Office of Grants Managements' (OGM) internal controls over fixed-priced grants. The evaluation will include an analysis of the Corporation's ability to provide adequate oversight during the fixed-priced grant life cycle including award, performance, draw-downs, and close-out phases of fixed-priced grants.
<p>The selected firm shall provide one (1) contracted evaluator to assist the OIG to perform an evaluation in accordance with the Quality Standards for Inspection and Evaluation issued by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE).</p>
<p>Description of the Corporation for National and Community Service<br /><br />The mission of the Corporation is to improve lives, strengthen communities, and foster civic participation through service and volunteering. The National Community Service Trust Act of 1993 (which amended the National and Community Service Act of 1990) established the Corporation as a government corporation, subject to the requirements of the Government Corporation Control Act, to engage Americans of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service. Enacted on April 2009, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act (Serve Act) reauthorized and expanded the mission and operation of CNCS and created new programs, amending the National and Community Service Act of 1990 and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973.</p>
<p>The Corporation provides grants and other incentives to states, local municipalities, and not-for-profit organizations to address community needs in education, homeland security, housing, health care, environmental protection, and disaster relief. The Corporation oversees the following major programs:</p>
<p>&bull; AmeriCorps is the national service program that engages Americans in full-time and sustained part-time community service and provides education awards in return for such service. AmeriCorps programs include State, National, Tribes, and Territories (State and National); Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA); and National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC).</p>
<p>&bull; Senior Corps is a network of volunteers, age 55 and older, who participate in the Foster Grandparent Program, the Senior Companions Program, and the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program. These programs tap the experience, skills, talents, and creativity of America's seniors.</p>
<p>&bull; Social Innovation Fund is a program created by the Serve Act to improve the lives of people in low-income communities by mobilizing public and private resources to grow innovative nonprofit organizations that have evidence of compelling impact in three priority areas of need: economic opportunity, youth development and healthy futures.</p>
<p>Additional information regarding the Corporation can be obtained from the Corporation's website at http://www.nationalservice.org.</p>
<p><br />Description of the Office of Inspector General</p>
<p>In 1993, Congress created the OIG along with the Corporation in the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. As an independent and objective entity within the Corporation, the OIG conducts audits, evaluations, and investigations of the Corporation's grantees, programs, and operations with the goal of detecting and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse. The OIG further recommends revisions to CNCS policies and practices, with the goal of promoting economy and efficiency. The OIG keeps the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer, Board of Directors, and the Congress fully informed of its work and findings. Additional information regarding the OIG can be obtained from the OIG's website at http://www.cncsoig.gov.</p>
<p>The OIG Audit Section's responsibilities include auditing the Corporation's annual financial statements, assessing the Corporation's management controls, reviewing the Corporation's operations, and evaluating/auditing individual grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements funded by the Corporation.

Any personnel replacement must at least have equal to or better experience or education, as determined by the OIG, than the person replaced.</p>
<p><br />Declaration of Independence and Conflict of Interest Statement</p>
<p>The firm and its proposed contracted evaluator are expected to evaluate their independence considering its known relationships with the Corporation, if any, and to provide a Declaration of Independence and Conflict of Interest Statement (Attachment A) for the firm and a Personal Statement of Independence (Attachment B) for the contracted evaluator with its task order proposal.</p>
<p>If, during performance of this task order, the firm and/or contracted evaluator receive additional information, which was unknown at the time of task order award, and which indicates a possible conflict of interest or potentially voids the Declaration of Independence, the firm and/or contracted evaluator shall immediately disclose this information to the OIG. The OIG will determine whether re-certification is required.</p>
<p><br />Non-Disclosure Agreement</p>
<p>During the course of the contract performance period, the contracted evaluator will be given conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information. The firm and contracted evaluator are subject to the terms and conditions of this Non-Disclosure Agreement (Agreement). The firm is required to ensure that the contracted evaluator (and any replacement) assigned to this task order understand and comply with the following non-disclosure terms and conditions:</p>
<p>&bull; By being granted conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in the firm. Under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the firm is therefore obligated to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure.</p>
<p>&bull; As used in this Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is any information the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of which could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Title 5 U.S.C. &sect;552a, but which has not been specifically authorized, under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress, to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.</p>
<p>&bull; The firm is being granted conditional access contingent upon award of the contract for the sole purpose of performing this contract. This approval will permit conditional access to certain information, and attendance at meetings in which such information is discussed or otherwise made available. This Agreement will not allow access to materials that the OIG has predetermined, in its sole discretion, is inappropriate for disclosure pursuant to this Agreement. This may include sensitive but unclassified information provided to the OIG by other agencies of the United States Government.</p>
<p>&bull; No sensitive but unclassified information that is provided to the firm pursuant to this Agreement will be divulged to anyone, unless the firm has received written authorization from the OIG. Should the firm needs to make use of any sensitive but unclassified information, it will do so in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Prior to publication of any document or other release of information that is based upon knowledge it obtained during the course of the contract period, the firm will submit a request to the OIG for a security review in order for the OIG to ensure that no sensitive but unclassified information is disclosed.</p>
<p>&bull; The firm hereby assigns to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of sensitive but unclassified information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>&bull; If the firm is permitted, at the sole discretion of the OIG, to review any official documents containing sensitive but unclassified information, such review will be conducted at a secure facility or under circumstances that will maintain the security protection of such material. The firm will not be permitted to, and will not make, any copies of documents to which conditional access is granted. Any notes taken during the course of such access will remain at the OIG and will be placed in secure storage unless OIG officials determine that the notes contain no sensitive but unclassified information. If the firm wishes to have the notes released to it, OIG officials will review the notes for the purpose of deleting any sensitive but unclassified information and creating a redacted copy of the notes. If the firm does not wish a review of any notes that it may make, those notes will remain in sealed and secure storage at OIG. If the firm violates the terms and conditions of this Agreement, it understands that the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive but unclassified information could compromise the security of the Corporation and OIG.</p>
<p>&bull; If the terms and conditions of this Agreement are violated, such violation may result in the cancellation of conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information. This may serve as a basis for denying the firm conditional access to OIG information, both classified and sensitive but unclassified information, in the future. If the firm or individuals it assigns to the contract violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the United States may institute a civil action for damages or any other appropriate relief. The willful disclosure of information, which the firm has agreed herein not to divulge, may constitute a criminal offense.</p>
<p>&bull; Unless and until the firm is provided a written release by the OIG from this Agreement or any portions of it, all conditions and obligations contained in this Agreement apply both during the period of conditional access, which shall terminate at the conclusion of performing the evaluation, and at all times thereafter.</p>
<p>&bull; Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>&bull; The firm understands that the United States Government may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement, including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement.</p>
<p>&bull; By granting conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government does not waive any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that it may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive but unclassified information to which the firm has been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>&bull; The firm's execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect, in any manner, any other secrecy or nondisclosure Agreement that it has executed or may execute with the United States Government. The firm makes this Agreement in good faith, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion.</p>
<p>Safeguarding of Sensitive Data</p>
<p>The firm and contracted evaluator will treat all information received as sensitive. Contracted evaluator removing or receiving data from government sources is responsible for protection and security procedures to prevent loss or compromise of the data. This protection includes the physical security of documents, or electronic media on which the data resides. The firm's or contracted evaluator's equipment used to process or store sensitive government data must meet the requirements for information security contained in the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), OMB guidance, and standards as published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
<p>Contracted evaluator with access to PII, networks of the Corporation, OIG, grantees or subgrantees is required to satisfactorily complete the Corporation's information technology security and privacy web-based training modules.</p>
<p>OMB has stated that security of an agency's IT system and oversight of that security is to be commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm associated with unauthorized use, access, or a compromise of the data. For this task, the major risk factors are loss or disclosure of members' or volunteers' PII, employee PII and salary information, and Corporation information security and configuration settings.</p>
<p>Required Disclosure</p>
<p><br />&bull; Contracted evaluator who is involved in an actual or suspected breach or loss of PII must report the incident to the OIG within one hour of occurrence discovery.</p>
<p>Security Requirements<br />This is a moderate risk, public trust position, requiring favorable adjudication of a background investigation. If selected for this contract, the contracted evaluator will be subject to favorable adjudication of a suitability determination and will be required to complete an SF-85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, to initiate a background investigation. As discussed in previous section, the contracted evaluator must successfully pass the Corporation's information technology security and privacy web-based training modules.</p>
<p>Contract Period of Performance<br />The period of performance will be from May 15, 2013 to July 30, 2013. The contracted evaluator is expected to be on-site five days per week (weekdays), eight hours per day (during Corporation's public service hours). The Corporation's public service hours are Mondays to Fridays, between 8:30am to 5:00pm, excluding Federal holidays. Overtime is not authorized unless specifically approved in advance by the AIGA.</p>
<p><br />OIG Oversight and Coordination</p>
<p>The OIG will actively monitor the contracted evaluator's performance to ensure work quality and progress. The contracted evaluator is expected to periodically, including a mandatory weekly formal status meeting, discuss with OIG's AIGA and Audit Managers regarding assigned work progress, obstacles, and/or findings.</p>
<p>Failure to promptly bring issues, impediments, or findings to the attention of OIG, and via the weekly status meetings, will be considered a failure to deliver promised services. "Promptly" means during the course of the contract performance rather than towards the end of the contract performance period or the end of the assigned engagements.</p>
<p><br />Contracting Officer's Representative</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) supports and assists the Contracting Officer in the administration of the task order. The COR provides technical directions to the contracted evaluator, review contracted evaluator's work, and oversee contracted evaluator's performance. Technical direction is defined as direction to the firm/contracted evaluator which fills in details, suggests possible lines of inquiry, or otherwise supplements the scope of work.</p>
<p>The COR for this contract is Mr. Stuart Axenfeld, Assistant Inspector General for Audit, (202) 606-9360. Mr. Axenfeld may reassign task monitor duties to other OIG Audit Managers with e-mail notification to the firm with a copy to the Contracting Officer. Nevertheless, Mr. Axenfeld will remain the primary COR and technical point of contact for this contract. Changes to the task order will be in writing and can only be issued by the Contracting Officer. Upon award, copies of the COR appointment letters outlining duties, responsibilities, and limitations will be provided.</p>
<p>The COR or assigned task monitor will review and accept all work and deliverables performed by the contracted evaluator under the task order.</p>
<p>Cost Schedule</p>
<p>This is a time-and-materials task order per FAR Part 16.601. Travel and per-diem costs are not authorized for this task order. No travel is required for the contracted evaluator under this task order.</p>
<p>The firm's proposed and accepted labor hours budget is provided for budgetary and monthly invoicing purposes. However, the firm will have the flexibility to realign labor hours but prior approval by the Contracting Officer must be obtained. As long as the firm stays within the contract ceiling and the technical performance and the proposed technical approach are not adversely affected, the Contracting Officer may approve the realignment. Also, the firm may not add labor categories or adjust labor rates without written approval from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>COST SCHEDULE<br />Labor Category Labor Rate Estimated Hours Total<br /><br />Payment Schedule</p>
<p>Interim payments under FAR Clause 52.232-7 (Payments under "Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts (Mar 2000") are authorized.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to: barry.meyer@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 12:00p Pacific Time on (29) (APRIL) 2013_.</p>

Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

Failure to be properly registered at the time and date of closing will render the quote non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Proposed responders must submit any questions concerning this solicitation before April 24, 2013, 12:00 p.m. CST, to reasonably expect a response from the Government. Those questions not received within the prescribed date will not be considered. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 32.705-1(a), insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts if the contract will be chargeable to funds of the new fiscal year and the contracting action is to be initiated before the funds are available: 
AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984) 
Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>New equipment/parts only.  No remanufactured products. <BR> <BR>Quotes will be evaluated based on price and delivery.  Price is the most important factor. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>FAR 52.211-6 -- Brand Name or Equal is incorporated into this solicitation and any subsequent awards. To meet the Brand Name or Equal provision the Quoter must: (a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as ?brand name or equal,? the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government?s needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that ?equal? products must meet are specified in the solicitation. (b) To be considered for award, offers of ?equal? products, including ?equal? products of the brand name manufacturer, must? (1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; (2) Clearly identify the item by? (i) Brand name, if any; and (ii) Make or model number; (3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and (4) Clearly describe any modification the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modification. (c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate ?equal? products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an ?equal? product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>Procedures for commercial vehicle access to military installations are varied.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly? (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <BR> <BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Air Force is seeking potential contractors who are interested in providing engineering services to the A-10 System Program Office (SPO). This notification is a request for information to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, data or data-rights, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for the A-10 SPO at Hill Air Force Base, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid. To be considered as a potential source for this requirement, a Contractor will be required to submit data in response to the future solicitation, verifying capabilities to meet the requirements on solicitation. The contractor is requested to respond to this RFI as identified in the "Responses" section of this RFI. Based on the "Notes" section of this RFI, it shall not be construed that the Government for contractor responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The A-10 SPO is the primary integrator for all modifications and sustainment changes for the weapon system and the current and anticipated dynamic battlefield environments drive many modernization and sustainment changes to the A-10 legacy aircraft, creating unique requirements to maintain the A-10 throughout its life cycle. Modifications affecting all A-10 functional areas and interfaces to include mechanical, structural, electrical, avionics, weapons, support equipment and operational flight programs (OFP), continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace. <br />Starting with the A-10 Wing Replacement Program (WRP), the A-10 SPO has implemented Siemens Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) products for configuration and control of 3D models and all associated technical data. The currently owned and used products are the basic TeamCenter Configuration Management Module and the TeamCenter In-service (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO)) module. As a result of the success on the WRP, the A-10 SPO is expanding the use of Siemens PLM technology and processes for other elements and lifecycle processes of the A-10 aircraft. The A-10 WRP TeamCenter Steering Committee has developed an implementation outline including such capabilities to include but not limited to additional functionality for engineering, interfaces with USAF systems, support for commodities, supplier interaction, and depot support. As the use of TeamCenter PLM technology and processes spreads beyond the WRP's current release, a more detailed implementation strategy, roadmap and plan is required. This plan needs to consider and dovetail with the Air Force PLM Initiative (PLMi) strategy plan, the A-10 SPO realignment with Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Fighters and Bombers Program Executive Office (PEO) and the Siemens PLM product roadmap. A-10 SPO requires support to develop and execute such an implementation strategy, roadmap, and plan.<br />The goal of the new A-10 SPO Process, System Design and Implementation Support services is threefold: <br />a. Refine/Develop a Strategy and Implementation Plan for the continual improvement and expansion of the current TeamCenter environment for configuration management across the rest of the weapon system.<br />b. Refine/Develop, map and document standard logistics and engineering processes and procedures and their information technology interfaces for the sustainment of the A-10 in the AF inventory.<br />c. Further develop standard engineering processes and policy (tools, templates and training) for efficient future acquisition and sustainment of the A-10 aircraft.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>This effort is to acquire engineering services to identify new and developing technologies that can support the accomplishment of A-10 missions and either eliminate or minimize operational and/or sustainability gaps. The Contractor will have to perform integrated systems engineering to deconflict and integrate A-10 baselines, architecture, programs and processes. These include the necessary tools, templates and training for efficient future acquisition and sustainment of the A-10 aircraft. Specific tasks include the provision of a deconfliction matrix, updates, integration and support of products, views or documents called out in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), the analysis for the Support Equipment Roadmap, baseline maintenance, A-10 Weapon System Management Environment (AWSME) maintenance, TeamCenter software support, and configuration technical support . The Contractor must obtain applied knowledge of current Air Force Systems and maintenance engineering processes, as well as logistics management best practices using ERP/APS processes in governmental agencies. Additional knowledge specifically related to Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force logistics goals, objectives, and current practices is also required. The Contractor must be familiar with the DoD Architecture Framework (DODAF) 2.0, as well as the documents listed in the Appendices of the PWS.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Air Force is seeking potential contractors who are interested in providing engineering services to the A-10 System Program Office (SPO). This notification is a request for information to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, data or data-rights, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for the A-10 SPO at Hill Air Force Base, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid. To be considered as a potential source for this requirement, a Contractor will be required to submit data in response to the future solicitation, verifying capabilities to meet the requirements on solicitation. The contractor is requested to respond to this RFI as identified in the "Responses" section of this RFI. Based on the "Notes" section of this RFI, it shall not be construed that the Government for contractor responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The A-10 SPO is the primary integrator for all modifications and sustainment changes for the weapon system and the current and anticipated dynamic battlefield environments drive many modernization and sustainment changes to the A-10 legacy aircraft, creating unique requirements to maintain the A-10 throughout its life cycle. Modifications affecting all A-10 functional areas and interfaces to include mechanical, structural, electrical, avionics, weapons, support equipment and operational flight programs (OFP), continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace. <br />Starting with the A-10 Wing Replacement Program (WRP), the A-10 SPO has implemented Siemens Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) products for configuration and control of 3D models and all associated technical data. The currently owned and used products are the basic TeamCenter Configuration Management Module and the TeamCenter In-service (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO)) module. As a result of the success on the WRP, the A-10 SPO is expanding the use of Siemens PLM technology and processes for other elements and lifecycle processes of the A-10 aircraft. The A-10 WRP TeamCenter Steering Committee has developed an implementation outline including such capabilities to include but not limited to additional functionality for engineering, interfaces with USAF systems, support for commodities, supplier interaction, and depot support. As the use of TeamCenter PLM technology and processes spreads beyond the WRP's current release, a more detailed implementation strategy, roadmap and plan is required. This plan needs to consider and dovetail with the Air Force PLM Initiative (PLMi) strategy plan, the A-10 SPO realignment with Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Fighters and Bombers Program Executive Office (PEO) and the Siemens PLM product roadmap. A-10 SPO requires support to develop and execute such an implementation strategy, roadmap, and plan.<br />The goal of the new A-10 SPO Process, System Design and Implementation Support services is threefold: <br />a. Refine/Develop a Strategy and Implementation Plan for the continual improvement and expansion of the current TeamCenter environment for configuration management across the rest of the weapon system.<br />b. Refine/Develop, map and document standard logistics and engineering processes and procedures and their information technology interfaces for the sustainment of the A-10 in the AF inventory.<br />c. Further develop standard engineering processes and policy (tools, templates and training) for efficient future acquisition and sustainment of the A-10 aircraft.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>This effort is to acquire engineering services to identify new and developing technologies that can support the accomplishment of A-10 missions and either eliminate or minimize operational and/or sustainability gaps. The Contractor will have to perform integrated systems engineering to deconflict and integrate A-10 baselines, architecture, programs and processes. These include the necessary tools, templates and training for efficient future acquisition and sustainment of the A-10 aircraft. Specific tasks include the provision of a deconfliction matrix, updates, integration and support of products, views or documents called out in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), the analysis for the Support Equipment Roadmap, baseline maintenance, A-10 Weapon System Management Environment (AWSME) maintenance, TeamCenter software support, and configuration technical support . The Contractor must obtain applied knowledge of current Air Force Systems and maintenance engineering processes, as well as logistics management best practices using ERP/APS processes in governmental agencies. Additional knowledge specifically related to Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force logistics goals, objectives, and current practices is also required. The Contractor must be familiar with the DoD Architecture Framework (DODAF) 2.0, as well as the documents listed in the Appendices of the PWS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was created as an independent Agency by Congress in 1974 to enable the nation to safely use radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while ensuring that people and the environment are protected. The NRC regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials, such as in nuclear medicine, through licensing, inspection, and enforcement of its requirements. The NRC's headquarters are in Rockville, Maryland, and there are a number of other offices around the United States.
<p>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform Design Engineering Inspections. In accordance with the baseline inspection portion of the Reactor Oversight Process (ROP), the NRC inspects the design and operation of nuclear power reactor plants. These inspections sometimes require contractor technical support.</p>
<p>Component Design Bases Inspections (CDBIs) are the primary inspection under this contract. They verify that design bases have been correctly implemented for the selected risk-significant components and that operating procedures and operator actions are consistent with design and licensing bases. This ensures that selected components are capable of performing their safety functions.</p>
<p>In addition to CDBIs, contract technical support may be required for other inspections of design and operations including (but not limited to): fire protection; plant modifications; supplemental inspections at plants which experience degraded performance; reactive inspections (such as augmented inspection teams and special Inspections); independent design verification programs; and integrated design inspections.</p>
<p>Since 1982, the NRC has had various design engineering inspection programs that required contractor assistance to supplement staff resources. These have included integrated design inspections (IDIs), safety system functional inspections (SSFIs), electrical distribution system functional inspections (EDSFIs), service water system operational performance inspections, safety systems design and performance capability (SSDPC), fire protection inspections, and CDBIs.</p>
<p>The NRC has found it beneficial to form inspection teams including contractors with current nuclear plant experience. These inspections usually start with design requirements, and follow the plant implementation through plant operations and maintenance practices.</p>
<p>The resulting contract is expected to be an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract. The expected period of performance is a base period of three years with two additional one-year periods.&nbsp; This is a total small business set aside.</p>

<DESC>(Correction to last Paragraph) <br>  <br> THIS IS A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT SURVEY ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTE, OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  <br>    <br> The Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements(PLA) for the titled project above.  <br>    <br> Project Description: Construction of an approximately 173,085 gross square foot Conference Center and Dormitories. The project requires the construction of a state-of-the-art conference center and dormitories, and associated site work and utilities infrastructure.  There are high level finishes required and tiered FFE packages to complete the fit-out and furnishing of the facility.  <br>    <br> This project will be design/bid/build, using NAICS Code: 236220 - Construction of Buildings, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The magnitude of construction for this project is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. Small Business contractors must perform 20% of the work. The estimated period of performance is 365 days.  <br>    <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement as described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).    <br>    <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy states: Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.  Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law.  Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, and Clause: FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.  <br>    <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLAs per FAR 22.503 (c) are:  <br>    <br> Does the project require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades?  <br>    <br> Is there is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited?  <br>    <br> Will completion of the project require an extended period of time?  <br>    <br> Have project labor agreements been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of the project?  <br>    <br> Will a project labor agreement promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs?  <br>    <br> Are there any other factors that the Corps should consider?  <br>    <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:  <br>    <br> 1.	Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind?  If so, please provide supporting documentation?  <br>    <br> 2.	Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project?  If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.  <br>    <br> 3.	Are you aware of any past or current labor strikes or disputes that would directly impact the consideration of a PLA on the referenced project?   If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.  <br>    <br> 4.	 Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed?  If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.  <br>    <br> 5.	Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.    <br>    <br> 6.	Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.  <br>      <br> 7.	Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA for the referenced project.  <br>    <br> 8.	Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA for the referenced project.  <br>    <br> The construction community is invited to answer and comment on the use of a PLA for the above titled project.  <br>  <br> Responses shall be submitted via email to Kevin Cook at Kevin.j.Cook@usace.army.mil no later than 1:00 p.m. (EST) on 09 May 2013.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey. <br>    <br>

The combination of a mobilization and a demobilization will be counted as 1 each.  <br>    <br>  3.6 Bid Item No. 0006 (OPTION): ADDITIONAL COST FOR DIVE CREW WORK		  <br>    <br>  3.6.1 Measurement  <br>    <br>    Measurement for payment will be based upon the following: If dive work is required, then in addition to work associated with routine dive activities, a minimum of one of the following is required to be completed during the 1 week (5 days/wk; 10 hrs/day) that the CLIN is exercised in order to receive full payment for dive work:   <br>  a)	150 anchors drilled and installed underwater or  <br>  b) Complete installation of 5 pier guides, 4 support beams, & 16 stoplogs; and leak test if directed by the COR  <br>  3.6.2 Payment  <br>    <br>    Payment will be made for costs associated with the item listed below:  <br>  Additional cost to dry installation for work by dive crew on a per week basis not to exceed 3 weeks per CLIN. If the contractor is unable to complete the required work during the 1 week (5 days/wk; 10 hrs/day) period, then payment will be prorated accordingly. For example, if 100 anchors were completed during the week then Contractor will receive two-thirds of the full payment amount.  <br>  Inquiries for Industry:  <br>  1.	 Is it possible to bid this Option with the CLIN structure shown?  Explain alternatives.  <br>    <br>  2.	Are the productivity requirements of installing 150 anchors in a 5 day week, 10 hr day, reasonable?  Explain alternatives.  <br>    <br>  3.	 List any concerns with and alternatives to having the dive crew deploy to the site for the pre-production test anchorage, demob, and then again mob to the site a few weeks later to install production anchors.  <br>    <br>  4.	Is the following alternative reasonable and economical?  In lieu of executing the contract as stated in the third paragraph of the SOW above, require certified anchor installers also be certified divers.  These installers would then be on site for the duration of the anchor installation phase, whether installation conditions were in the  quote mark dry quote mark  or underwater.  The contractor would still be required to show the necessity for diving before diving option would be exercised in the contract.  Please explain.  <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>  5.	Please list any other comments related to this work.  <br>

See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> The Government has already paid Wolverine to build the mold for the parts for the Bar Armor Upgrade Kits. To have any other contractor provide the parts, the Government would have to pay to have another mold built.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a scientific regulatory agency that employs more than 10,000 scientific, technical, and support staff who are responsible for protecting and promoting the public health in the United States. One of the ways that FDA will advance its broad public health mission is by working to transform administrative systems and infrastructure to support FDA operations. The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the regulation and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription, and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), veterinary products, and cosmetics. This is accomplished through the regulatory review of sponsor submissions in a supportive infrastructure that allows for tools, technologies, and processes to be integrated and use standardized data, enabling modern review processes and capabilities. <br /><br />The scope of this contract is the complete range of activities necessary to promote the efficient and technologically advanced review and analysis of standardized data for regulatory review of sponsor submissions at the FDA. The contract will enable reviewers to assess product safety, efficacy, and quality by providing the capability to ask sponsors more in-depth questions, devote more time to team discussions, and achieve greater transparency and consistency in decision making and documentation. These capabilities shall be enabled through coordinated use of tools and technologies across all review disciplines, as well as organizational initiatives (e.g. change management, communications, training, knowledge management, data management, and collaboration). <br /><br />The operation/maintenance of and further developments/ enhancements specific to the Script Launcher and CSC Review Portal applications are explicitly excluded from the scope of this contract. In no case will the FDA fund the operation/maintenance of or continued developments/enhancements specific to these two applications under this contract.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to award a sole source contract to Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) (1300 W WT Harris Blvd. Charlotte, NC 28262) for a 3 year membership to their EPRI HRA/PRA Tool User Group, which will give the NRC access to EPRI's HRA Calculator Software. All of the NRC commercial nuclear power licensees are currently EPRI HRA User Group members and either using or transitioning to use this software. The NRC's Level 3 probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) project collaborates with the Vogtle station for plant specific analyses, the project's approach is to utilize Vogtle's existing analysis as much as possible. The EPRI HRA Calculator is the only software able to read the Vogtle Station's data files generated by using the EPRI HRA, and this software will significantly reduce NRC staffs' effort in understanding Vogtle's HRA analysis to meet the tight deliverable schedule of the Level 3 PRA project. EPRI does not allow any other sources to sell its EPRI HRA Calculator (verified on March 12, 2013); therefore the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by EPRI.</p>
