<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI) for Deep Bleeder Acoustic Coagulation
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), regarding a non-invasive method to stop bleeding in wounds to the femoral artery, abdominal vessels and large vessels of the arms.  These potentially exsanguinating wounds (deep bleeders) cause fatalities and amputations in combat situations.  The system should utilize non-invasive technologies to both locate and coagulate deep bleeders.  It is required that the system be operable by minimally trained military personnel in the combat environment and allow them to rapidly stop the bleeding.  The envisioned solution is a conformal array of ultrasound transducers that is capable of localizing the bleeding using Doppler ultrasound and coagulating the blood around the vessel using high intensity focused ultrasound; however other approaches are also encouraged.  
 
DARPA solicits potential performers to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the government in formulating the intended formal solicitation.  DARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, estimate potential system performance (minimum detectable blood velocity, maximum coagulatable blood velocity and speed to coagulation), and comment on the expected robustness, affordability, weight, size and power requirements of the proposed approach.  In addition, DARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential commercial market for such a device or related technologies and the plan to develop the device for this market including the steps needed to obtain the necessary approvals to field such a device.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.   The Government intends to issue a formal solicitation during the third quarter of calendar year 2004 for design and development of functional prototype systems that will enable the location and treatment of deep bleeders on the battlefield.   

Responses should be limited to five pages for any given concept.  Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such.  Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  For all RFI responses, an additional, non-proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact and contact information.  RFI responses should be received no later than COB July 9, 2004. 

RFI Responses should be submitted in a commonly used electronic format and may be e-mailed or mailed on a CD-ROM to:

<DESC>Question:  Is it permissible to conduct the training in a location in Iraq other than Baghdad?

Answer:  Yes, as long as all logistical arrangements include, but are not limited to, such items as transportation, country clearances and an appropriate training facility.  Country shall be within the proximity of Iraq.

Question:  Would the US Government consider the possibility of the vendor bringing the trainees to the US for the training?

Answer:  No

Question: Can you verify class size?

Answer:  Contract period of performance shall be six months starting 15 Jul ending with a class size shall be 150 students per class.  Two overlapping classes per month shall be conducted on approximately the first and 15th per month. All references in the solicitation shall reflect this information.  The 12 month option shall operate as the original contract.

Question;  Could you please clarify that the candidates are to be selected by the Government? What candidate qualifications are expected?

Answer: The contractor is not responsible for selecting students, that function will be handled by the CPA or equivalent organization.  Most students will have had prior military training.

Question:  Is a site already specified for the training?

Answer: No

Question:  Will the Government provide force protection?

Answer: No.

Question:  Is any attrition allowed for or are we to attempt to keep all students in the training program regardless of ability? If students fail to meet standards, can we retrain them? 

Answer:  An attrition rate of approximately 15% is expected.  Only those qualified will graduate. Retraining is acceptable, if appropriate under the circumstances.

Question:  Can we start a smaller class weekly instead of bi-weekly?

Answer:  150 per class running concurrently twice per month is optimal.

Question:  AK47s are becoming increasingly scarce in Iraq. Will the Government be able to provide access to confiscated AK47s?

Answer: No

Question:  On the CPA website for this proposal, the closing date has been changed to "no expiration". What does this mean? Has the due date for proposal submission been put on hold?

Answer:  Due Date for the proposals is now 19 Jun, “no expiration” annotation on website was caused by a website software error.

Question: Reference SOW Paragraph 5a. “Minimum of one indigenous Arabic Speaking instructor per 20 students.” Do indigenous personnel have to be Subject Matter Experts? Can indigenous personnel act as Interpreter or Assistant Instructor?

Answer:  It was the intention of the contract to have Arabic instructors to eliminate the need for interpreters, thus lowering cost.  Indigenous instructors would drive employment of local Iraqis and eliminate the need for travel, lodging and subsistence.  If cost effective, interpreters may be used.

Question:  The solicitation mentions driving training conducted in the classroom. Do you intend for practical driving exercises to be included in the course of instruction?

Answer:  Driver training shall consist of classroom training and possibly low speed or static actual vehicle training. High speed training shall not be required. (possibly was misspelled)

Question:  If a new site is selected and new facilities must be constructed, do the facilities need to be a permanent facilities intended to last more than 5 years, or temporary facilities capable of schooling the students within the next 5 years?
Answer:  Permanent or temporary facilities may be used.
Question:  If a new site is selected and new facilities must be constructed, is it the intention of the Government, to begin with temporary site facilities while a permanent build out is underway?
Answer:  Facilities are the sole responsibility of the contractor.
Question:  Does the Government intend to provide living accommodations for the students at the school facility after they training?
Answer:  No, accommodations are the responsibility of the contractor.
Question:  Does the Government intend for any administrative Iraqi officials to work and/or live out of the site or facility during and after this mission is complete?
Answer: No
Question:  In the event that the contractor is required to provide Force Protection for the site, will the contractor be allowed to utilize LCNs and/or TCNs for same?
Answer:  Local Contract Nationals may be used if they are trained, uniformed, armed and a credible guard service.  I am unfamiliar with TCN, but a trained, uniformed, armed, credible guard service must be used by the contractor. 

Question:  Is there an incumbent company that is doing the PSD training of Iraqis presently? 

Answer: Dynacorp completed a similar course of instruction under contract DABV01-03-C00027.
 
Question:    Would you help clarify training dates as they pertain to dates, holidays, Islamic Holy days and other foreseeable impacts on training?

Answer:  Instruction will run 7 days a week, with only Ramadan as a day off.




Question:  Will training be conducted, or suspended during special holidays, i.e. Eid, Ramadan, etc?

Answer:  Ramadan only will be a day off.

Question:  Does this alter either the training curriculum/calendar, or does it alter the course duration?

Answer:  Training schedule should encompass this day off.

Question:  Is there a hard date that training must commence?  What date is that date (10 July, or 15 July)?

Answer: Yes, 15 Jul

Question:  How soon post RFP Response Date of 12 June 2004 do you anticipate awarding the work?  

Answer:  Solicitation response date is now 19 Jun 2004.  The Government intends to award by 26 Jun 2004.

Question: Do you intend to sole source this RFP, or would you consider award in portions, i.e. Life Support (food, generator, transportation, etc), Construction, and Training.  

Answer:  Award will be based on full and open competition and awarded as one complete job.

Question:  How much advance notice of exercise of Options should awardee expect?  Again, preparation/notice is important to ensure cadre continuity, logistics support, etc.

Answer:  We intend to provide 30 days written notice of intent to exercise the option.

Question 6:  Attrition- The Is there criteria, i.e.. unsafe or dangerous behavior (weapons safety), cheating, other, that would warrant removal from course?  Is it up to contractor to come up with this, or would something be provided?  No enforcement, or attrition guidelines will preclude a rigid weapons safety policy (which is clearly in the best interest of the MOJ), or standards enforcement.

Answer:  The contractor should develop a policy on above and enforce it in accordance with the guidelines in outlined in the Statement of Work.

Question:  Please confirm that all US employees or contract (1099) personnel must be covered by Defense Base Act Insurance.

Answer:  To be determined
