<CONTACT>Raymond Jennings, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-712-0626, Fax 202-216-3131, Email rjennings@usaid.gov
<DESC>USAID/Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova anticipate an award of a five-year, performance based contract to support Financial Sector/Pension System Development (FD/PSD in Ukraine.  The procurement will be through full and open competition.   

The purpose of USAID/Ukraine’s Financial Sector/Pension System Development Project (FS/PSD) is to create a viable, effective financial sector which will promote economic growth and provide a sound private pension system. 

The development of a viable, effective, financial sector will provide small and medium enterprises with access to financing to through the capital markets. In addition, USAID’s experience has demonstrated that when commercial banks realize that small and medium sized enterprises are obtaining credit through the capital markets, it can stimulate a competitive response which generates increased commercial bank lending to SMEs.

The development of a viable, effective, financial sector is also critical to the successful implementation of Ukraine’s mandatory, defined-contribution, private accumulation pension system.  This “second pillar” pension system which is scheduled to go into effect in January 2007 requires that all employees contribute 7% of their salaries the private accumulation pension system.  This will total a minimum of over $ 1 billion in contributions per year.  Properly invested, these funds can become a major engine of economic growth. However, Ukraine’s nascent financial sector is completely inadequate to accommodate the investment of such sums of money.  It is essential and urgent that the challenges of developing a financial market be met in order to protect the pension contributions of Ukraine’s labor force and to guarantee retirement payments to the country’s current and future pensioners.

The challenges to financial sector development in Ukraine include:

•	Prudential regulation and oversight, particularly in securities market and other non-bank financial markets, do not protect the public, nor stimulate the growth of financial markets.
•	Financial statements are not a reliable indicator of company financial performance and condition, and the public generally does not have access to accurate, understandable information on financial intermediaries
•	The capital markets infrastructure remains shallow, with inadequate non-bank financial institutions and instruments, insurance products, equity and debt markets, money market funds, corporate and municipal bonds.
•	The anticipated contributions to the Second Pillar pension system will quickly exceed domestic investment opportunities, which could result in a concentration in government securities, which will not fuel economic growth, or in sub-standard, high risk domestic corporate stocks and bonds.

Lack of progress in meeting these challenges can be attributed primarily to a lack of a modern joint-stock company law which incorporates the OECD principles of corporate governance which protect investors, and weak, inefficient financial market regulators.

To meet the challenges, the FS/PSD has set the following objectives: 

•	Strengthen the capacities of the financial markets regulators to provide efficient and effective prudential regulation to the NBFI sector.
•	Broaden the range of financial instruments available for portfolio investment.
•	Strengthen the capacity of the pension system to enhance the operational capabilities of the pension fund providers, regulators, supervisors, and policy makers.

USAID anticipates awarding one (1) contract, The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541611. The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov) on or around December 15, 2004. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no solicitation will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>USACE, Corps of Engineers Vicksburg District proposes to issue a sole source award to Ingersoll-Rand Company, 510 Hester Drive, White House, TN 37188-9255 for gear driven multi-van air motors with spline shaft instead of the standard keyed or square output shafts, Model No. 1801/VSM.

The air motor fits inside a pneumatic tying tool designed for the Government for typing concrete mattresses together.  The air motor must fit the base plate. The maximum diameter of the air motor shall not exceed 2.500 inches and the overall length shall n ot exceed 11.5 inches including the output shaft.  The air motor cannot extend pass the base plate in any direction. In order for the tying tool to accept any motor larger than specified or any motor, which does not conform to the base, the tying tool itse lf will have to be modified. The Government will not accept anything, which requires the tying tool to be modified.  The output shaft has a standard parallel side 6-spline shaft 1.375 inches long that extends from the mounting plate on the air motor. A bev el gear having a S.A.E. Standard Parallel-side with 6 spline, fitting a .75 inch nominal diameter Class B, will fit on the output shaft of this air motor.

The air motor shall have a minimum horsepower rating of 1.35 with a minimum stall torque of 65 foot-pounds and a minimum free speed of 370 r.p.m. This performance is base on operating air pressure of 90 psi. The maximum weight shall not exceed 6 pounds.  This will be a non-reversible air motor rated at an air pressure of 90 psi.  All bearings will either be roller or needle bearings including the bearings in the planetary gears.  A firm-fixed price award will be made utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Any other responsible source able to provide the requirement is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 15 days after its publication.

<CONTACT>Charles  Clements, Support Contractor, Phone 703-343-9218, Fax 703-343-9227, Email charles.clements@cpa-iq.org
<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 to SolicitationW914NS-05-Q-0009:

Question 1:  CLIN 0005 appears to be a duplicate of CLIN 0003. Is it a duplicate CLIN, or is the requirement to provide a qty of 2 DVORs. Answer: CLIN 0003 is a duplicate of CLIN 0005, delete CLIN 0003. There is only one (1) D-VOR/DME.
CLIN 0007 makes reference to connecting the radios to a consolidated terminal. Please provide further clarification as to the 'consolidated terminal.”ANSWER: Consolidated Terminal should be in a console within the ATC Tower. 

Question 2:  In the paragraph immediately following CLIN 0017, the solicitation notice states:
'Provide a proposal with a construction cost estimate for the Basra Airport in accordance with the Statement of work that is attachment 1.  The proposal shall include pricing for a complete system at Basra Airport. The cost proposal shall be in individual line item format.  Costs for all options should be included'. We interpret this to mean that the offeror is to provide a cost estimate for the civil works, which involves siting of the ATC equipment and installation of the items delivered under CLINS 0001-0009, 0011 and 0014 above. We also interpret this to be a request for a cost estimate separate to the pricing requested for CLINs 0001 through 0017, and that is should be a cost estimate as opposed to FFP. Please confirm that this is a correct interpretation. Also, which requirements should be considered as options? ANSWER:  This is not a CLIN but is a statement to indicate that the proposal shall be to supply a complete system. If Offeror has no options, then last line does not apply.  All pricing should be for a firm fixed price contract. 

Question 3: You have requested pricing for commercial products sold internationally, however the SOW requires deliverables above and beyond those that are normally provided commercially, such as drawings converted to metric measurements and produced in Arabic. Can documentation be provided in the English language only? Answer: Drawings in English with metric measurements are acceptable. The solicitation includes 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders/Commercial Items.  This clause invites the CO to incorporate certain clauses by reference, however no clauses are checked. Is it your intent to identify those clauses that are to be incorporated by reference? ANSWER: Yes, they will incorporated by reference in the contract.
Is clause 52.232-30, Installment Payments, likely to be applicable?  ANSWER: Installment or Advanced payments will not be authorized however, the Government will entertain Progress Payments.

Question 4:  CLIN 0014 refers to an “Air Traffic Control tower and/or Approach Control facility”.  CLIN 0007 refers to “limited Approach Control Support”.  There is no other reference to an Approach Control in the other documents.  Since the automation equipment requested in CLIN 0002 does not adequately support a full approach control functionality could you provide additional clarification as to the intent?  ANSWER:  CLIN 0014 Delete “and/or Approach Control Facility.” CLIN 0007 Change “ “limited Approach Control support” to read “limited Approach support”. Approach Radar at Basra is to function as a “stand alone” facility, but it should have the capability to expand-be linked to the Approach Control Facility at Baghdad as part of a nationwide system.

Question 5:  Reference CLIN 0007: Ground to air radio Communication Systems: "Approach Control (APP) be linked to a consolidated Terminal Approach Control (TRACON) located at Baghdad International Airport". Does this mean that just the radio channels (frequencies 121.5 and 243.0 MHz) are to be remoted back to the Baghdad ACC  (TRACON) via the existing VSAT network?  Is there a requirement to remote any of the other 9 radios back to the Baghdad TRACON? Is it valid to assume that a Voice Communications Control Switch (VCCS) is required to assign the radio frequencies to the various controller positions: i.e. Local control, ground control, clearance delivery, and approach control? ANSWER:  CLIN 0007 Frequencies 121.5, 243.0 and one additional VHF (to provide Baghdad Radar Approach Control) are remoted back to Baghdad.  Provide a Voice Communications Control Switch (VCCS) for the following controller positions
Local control, Ground Control, Clearance delivery and Approach control.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is seeking an Expression of Interest (EOI) from prospective contractors who may be interested in competing on a full and open basis for the contract to manage and operate the Nevada Test Site (NTS) and other satellite facilities and laboratories under the oversight of the NNSA Nevada Site Office.  The North American Industrial Classification System code for this effort will be 561210 with a size standard of $30 million. NNSA is currently preparing its solicitation (Request for Proposals).  The contractor will be required to provide the intellectual leadership and management expertise necessary and appropriate to manage and operate the NTS and to accomplish the missions assigned by NNSA.  The NTS is an approximately 1,375 square mile remote testing site in southern Nevada and represents the United Statesâ€™ unique capability to support nuclear testing and major experiments in the Stockpile Stewardship Program that involve Special Nuclear Material.  Established as the Atomic Energy Commissionâ€™s on-continent proving ground, the NTS has been the location for more than four decades of nuclear weapons testing.  Since the nuclear weapons testing moratorium in 1992 and under the direction of the Department of Energy, test site use has diversified into many other programs, such as hazardous chemical spill testing, emergency response training, conventional weapons testing, and waste management and environmental technology studies.  More than 1,100 support buildings and laboratories are spread across the NTS.  The other satellite facilities and laboratories are located in California, Maryland, Nevada, and New Mexico.

This synopsis is for planning purposes only and any information submitted by respondents is strictly voluntary.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation, or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information submitted by respondents.  All responses are to be submitted via email to the contracting officer Carol.Bacon@irs.gov.  Submittal of responses via telephone or facsimile will NOT BE ACCEPTED.

Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from an evaluation of the information provided.  However, the DHS will utilize the information gathered for technical and acquisition planning purposes.  If adequate responses are not received, from 8(a), HUBZone, small businesses, or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, the acquisition may be solicited on an unrestricted basis.  All data received in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis that is designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development of a procurement strategy to procure frequency converters to be used to support the testing and operation of various avionics gear in Mobile Facilities.  The frequency converter will take standard 60hz utility power from either a plant grid or Mobile Electric Power Plant (MEP), a diesel engine driven generator set.  The frequency converter take this 60hz power and convert it to 400hz power to support, to provide power to support avionics equipment.  We require a 10 KW frequency converter.  We intend to procure one (1) First Article Test (FAT) unit for functional testing by the government.  Delivery is required within 90 Days After Contract (DAC). Upon successful completion of functional testing we intend to exercise an option for the first production year, and place orders for an estimated total of 30 each.  Delivery shall be 120 After Receipt of Order (ARO).  The frequency converter shall meet the following requirements.  The frequency converter shall accept the following input power 120/208 VAC, 3-phase, 4-wire, and grounding at 50 or 60hz.  The neutral conductor shall be isolated from ground conductor.  The frequency converter shall produce the following output power 10 KW, 120/208 VAC, 3-phase, 4-wire, and grounding at 400hz.  The frequency converter shall have the following meter/indicators voltmeter, ammeter, and frequency meter.  These shall be readily accessible/viewable by the operator.  The frequency converter envelope shall be capable of mounting in a nineteen (19) inch rack.  The height of the unit shall be no larger than seventeen and one-half (17.5) inches; the depth shall be no larger than 24 inches.  The frequency converter shall weigh no more than three hundred (300) lbs.  The frequency converter shall be installed into a Mobile Facility (MF).  The frequency converter shall be subjected to the stresses of transportation by ship, truck, and internal airlift.  The frequency converter shall also be operated aboard ship, or in an expeditionary environment.  The frequency converter shall be able to function safely, and reliably after being subject to altitude, temperature, shock, vibration, humidity, and salt fog associated with the forms of transport listed above.  The frequency converter shall operate safely, and reliably when subjected in the shipboard and expeditionary environment.  The electromagnetic interference emitted by the frequency converter shall not degrade other equipment operating nearby.  The frequency converter shall not be susceptible to the electromagnetic interference of nearby equipment.  The Contractor shall provide an Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) strategy to maintain the frequency converter based on its operating environment.  The use of Government personnel, contractor personnel, or any combination may be proposed.  The frequency converter will be operated in an expeditionary environment.  It will be operated at the Intermediate level (I-level) and will be subject to the environmental conditions identified in the Performance Specification.  The frequency converter can be maintained and calibrated at the I-level maintenance activities.  The I-level can fault locate, remove and replace faulty assemblies and sub-assemblies and calibrate.  Depot level (D-level) maintenance will include all repairs beyond the capability of the I-level.  The Contractor shall deliver a commercial technical manual.  The TM shall be consistent with the ILS strategy and provide appropriate maintenance instructions with illustrated parts breakdown (IPB) and identify the disposition of parts.  The contractor shall identify training requirements for operation and maintenance, and develop training materials consistent with the ILS strategy.  The contractor shall determine if calibration procedures are required.  If calibration procedures are required they shall be developed consistent with the ILS strategy.  Spares support may be procured as a part of this contract.   Under this line item the contractor shall be responsible to either maintain stock, or establish agreements with other suppliers, to provide spares as required be delivered to the fleet within 96 hours.  This agreement is for a level of service with a defined turnaround time, not a specific quantity of parts.  The contractor shall submit as part of their quote a year-by-year quote for this option, as a firm fixed price.  The government may exercise this option, for spare parts support on a yearly basis for a period of ten years.  Repair and Depot support may be procured as a part of this contract. Under this line item the contractor shall be responsible to repair or replace failing units, and restore operational capability within 96 hours.  This agreement is for a level of service with a defined turnaround time, not a specific quantity of labor hours.  The contractor shall submit as part of their quote a year-by-year quote for this option, as a firm fixed price.  The government may exercise this option, for Repair and Depot support on a yearly basis for a period of ten years. We desire that the frequency converter will be tolerant of marginal input power quality, have good output power quality, have a demonstrated record of reliability, be easily maintained, and be capable of being wired together in parallel to meet increased power requirements.   Information such as catalogs, sketches, is invited.  This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  The Program Manager - Clothing and Individual Equipment has a need to identify commercially available towels.  All the items will be tested/evaluated for potential future use by the U.S. Army as a replacement for the towel currently in the clothing bag.  THERE IS CURRENTLY NO SOLICITATION FOR THIS ITEM.  All items must be produced in the U.S. of U.S. made fibers, but the Government is not mandating the type of fibers to be used.  The color is not a factor at this time, but it will hav e to match whatever the standard Army color is for the item, if approved for use.  The size of the towel shall be at a minimum 40 inches long by 20 inches wide.  The new/improved features the Army is looking for in a new towel are: quicker drying, better w ater absorption, durability, potentially lighter weight and able to be easily folded and stored.  Cost will be a determining factor.  Companies interested in having their items considered for possible future use must sumbit 5 of each item (for testing purp oses), along with an information paper (specification sheet) describing the fabric used to produce the item, in detail, to include such things as fabric name, place of manufacture, location of source of fibers, blend of material, current uses for fabric, p ricing information (cost per item) and any other information that the company feels appropriate.  The samples and information paper must be submitted no later than 31 January 2005 to Ms. Pam Moriarty, U.S. Army RDECOM, Natick Soldier Center, ATTN:  AMSRD-N SC-IP-A, Room D-226, Kansas Street, Natick, MA. 01760-5019.

<CONTACT>Pamela Moriarty, 508-233-4602
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  The Program- Manager - Clothing and Individual Equipment has a need to identify possible high performance, moisture-wicking commercially available undergarments to include women's sports bras, women's briefs and men's briefs.  All th e items will be tested/evaluated for potential future use by the U.S. Army. All the test data will be incorporated into one test report and will be used when needed for potential future Army procurements of moisture-wicking undergarments. THERE IS CURRENTL Y NO SOLICITATION FOR THESE ITEMS.  All the items must be produced in the U.S. Of U.S. Made fibers, but the Government is not mandating the type of fibers to be used.  The only absolute requirement is that  the undergarments shall have moisture-wicking cap abilities.  The color is not a factor at this time, but will have to match whatever the standard Army color is for the item if approved for use.  The basic fabric shall be a fabric with high performance properties which move (wick) moisture/perspiration fr om skin to ambient air, reduce odor, and any other properties you think appropriate in a high performance undergarment.  Cost will be a determining factor.  Companies interested in having their items considered for possible future use must sumbit 8 samples  of each item (for testing purposes), along with an information paper (specification sheet) describing the fabric used to produce the item, in detail to include such things as fabric name, place of manufacture, location of source of fibers, blend of materi al, current uses for fabric, pricing information (cost per item) and any other information that the company feels appropriate.

<ARCHDATE>04012005
<CONTACT>Pamela Moriarty, 508-233-4602
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  The Program Manager - Clothing and Individual Equipment has a need to identify commercially available duffel bags.  All the items will be tested/ evaluated for potential future use by the U.S. Army as a replacement for the duffel bag  currently in the clothing bag.  THERE IS CURRENTLY NO SOLICITATION FOR THIS ITEM.  All the items must be produced in the U.S. of U.S. made fibers, but the Government is not mandating the type of fibers to be used.   The color is not a factor at this time,  but will have to match whatever the standard Army color is for the item if approved for use.  Some of the new/improved features the Army is looking for in a new duffel bag are:  potential use of wheels on the bag, different design features to include addi tion of pockets on outside/inside, bags with different entry points, i.e. entry from the top, bottom or sides, new fabrics with equal durability of current fabric, potentially lighter weight than current duffel bag, easily stackable/stored.  Cost will be a  determining factor.  Companies interested in having their items considered for possible future use must submit 3 of each end item (for testing purposes), along with an information paper (specification sheet), describing the fabric used to produce the item , indetail, to include such things as fabric name, place of manufacture, location of source of fibers, blends of materials used, pricing information (cost per item) and any other information that the Company feels appropriate.  The samples and information paper must be submitted no later than 31 January 2005 to Ms. Pam Moriarty, U.S. Army RDECOM, Natick Soldier Center, ATTN: AMSRD-NSC-IP-A, Room D-226, Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760-5019.  All responses must be in writing.  No telephonic responses will be accepted.  EMAIL ADDRESS:  pamela.moriarty@natick.army.mil.

<DESC>The US Air Force (USAF) is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies to improve the safety and ride of High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs or Humvees) used in a combat environment.  Personnel are being injured from slamming into the roof of HMMWVs when they travel over rough surfaces. These personnel wear body armor or flak-vests and helmets; however they are still being injured.  Additional welded armor plating, attached to the HMMWV, makes them very heavy and cause an extremely poor ride due to the excess strain on the shocks. The roof-to-helmet distance on the HMMWV is small and the seats have no padding or spring to absorb the excess force.  Seatbelts are missing on most of the vehicles and when the seatbelts are present, the personnel do not wear them because of an inability to “turn and fire” if attacked.  Technologies are necessary to modify the current HMMWV for safety of the personnel.  Some possible technologies include: improved shocks for handling the extra load of armor, lowering the seat inside of the HMMWV to provide more room to dissipate the force, and adding an improved “energy absorbing” seat shock system. Additional ideas, devices, techniques would also be welcome. Through this BAA, the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in an Air Force Battlelab concept demonstration.  The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical solution available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding may be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Combat Command. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUMBISSIONS: Product information may be submitted until COB EST 10 December 2004.   White papers should not exceed five pages plus cover letter.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to Ms. Vanessa R. Lees of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at leesv@ctcnsc.org or by mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA  15904-1935.  The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Ms. Lees.  You may contact Ms. Vanessa R. Lees with any questions you may have at (814) 269-6275.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL RFI INFORMATION:  This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2).  There shall be no formal RFP.  The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received.  The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated.  This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.  For copyright purposes, offerors are also advised that submitting a proposal implies express permission for Concurrent Technologies Corporation personnel to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the received proposals for the report back to the client.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Army Material Command and Fort Campbell, KY, seek to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to possible privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, "Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority" for Utility Privatization of the Electric Distribution System at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  The potential privatization action will include transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and the obligation to serve.  The Army will not transfer ownership of land or any land lease interest for Fort Campbell, Kentucky and will grant easements and leases, with concurrence of the underlying leaseholder where applicable, for access to land associated with each utility system.  
 
OBJECTIVE:  Should privatization occur, the ownership of the Electric Distribution System and equipment to include, all capital investments, operation, maintenance and repair responsibilities, shall transfer to a publicly or privately owned utility provider.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, major systems renovation, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead shall be the responsibility of the new owner.  Utility services under the potential contract will not include the commodity itself.  
 
INSTALLATION AND UTILITY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
 
Note:	(1). All technical data and information listed below is to be considered either an estimated quantity or an approximate order of magnitude.  Companies responding to this notice of interest are responsible for verification of all inventory data.
 
(2). Companies responding to this notice of interest shall respond to interest in the entire scope of the requirement.
 
INSTALLATION DESCRIPTION:

Fort Campbell, Kentucky, occupies over 105,000 acres on the Kentucky-Tennessee border between Hopkinsville, KY and Clarksville, TN.  Although nearly two-thirds of the post are actually in Tennessee, the post office is located in Kentucky, and the identification lies within that state. 

Description of Facilities:  The utility system consists of the following Capital Assets:

A.  Electrical Distribution System:  The Fort Campbell electrical distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the points at which the electricity enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation defined by Section J01.10 of this section or the real estate easements that result from negotiations under this contract.  The system may include, but is not limited to transformers, underground and overhead circuits, utility poles, switches, streetlights, and vaults (traffic lights are not included in this contract).  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, and other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree on the following description. Under no circumstances shall the successful Contractor be entitled to any rate adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.

The installation shall retain joint use of all electrical utility poles.

All transformers have had all polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB’s) removed. 

Primary power enters the installation at four locations.  Power transmission lines carrying 69 kV enter the fort from Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) on the east side off of Route 41A.  An alternate 69 kV power feed and new substation (called Screaming Eagle) are being constructed near Gate 10.  Upon completion, the substation will be owned by TVA. Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation (CEMC) supplies 14.4 kV power at Range 28 and Range 29. They also supply 7.2 kV to the landfill, however CEMC owns and maintains the lines serving the landfill, so this area will not be included in the contract.  Pennyrile Rural Electric Cooperative (Pennyrile) supplies 14.4 kV to Range 46.  There is an off-site location called Red River where there is an emergency water pump station.  Power commodity is provided to this area by Clarksville Department of Electricity (CDE).  

There are approximately 14 miles of 69 kV transmission line and seven substations.  In addition, there are approximately 264 miles of distribution line and 7 substations.  The fort is in the midst of a $10 million upgrade to its electrical transmission and distribution system that is scheduled to be complete by April 2005.  Average monthly consumption is approximately 20.9 million kilowatt hours with usage peaking in late summer to early fall.  Emergency generators will remain under the ownership of the installation.


The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the Electric Distribution System.
REQUIREMENTS:  The general goal of the privatization process at Fort Campbell, Kentucky is to transfer all Capital assets of the Electric Distribution System to a municipal, private, regional, district or cooperative utility company or other non-Department of Defense entity to own and operate the systems on a long term contractual basis. Specific requirements under the contract will be: (1) the ability to service all areas within Fort Campbell, Kentucky and all Federal service premises currently served by Government owned systems that are the subject of this requirement.
PROCESS:  This request is to gather information from interested parties and is an essential step in determining market interest for the privatization of the Electric Distribution System at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is issued to determine market interest and feasibility as well as determining marketing strategies for privatizing the utility system.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) of the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate desires to issue a sources sought announcement to identify potential U.S. sources and gather information on current capabilities within the domestic market.  This is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR 31.205-18, “Bid and Proposal Costs.”  Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office, Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) is contemplating a procurement to establish a domestic manufacturing capability for the development and production of miniaturized refrigerant compressors for use in man-portable cooling, pilot cooling, and electronic equipment cooling systems.  The envisioned miniaturized compressors will be manufactured for both military and commercial applications.  Firms without domestic R&D and production capabilities are ineligible for any potential award.

Title III of the Defense Production Act authorizes the Federal Government to provide appropriate incentives to develop, maintain, modernize, and expand the productive capacities of domestic sources for critical components, critical technology items, and industrial resources essential for the execution of the national security strategy of the United States.  The principal role of Title III is to establish and maintain domestic production capacity for critical technology items and industrial resources essential to national defense.  This is primarily achieved by providing incentives, which serve as a stimulus to domestic industry to create, expand, or preserve economically viable capabilities.  This is accomplished in partnership with a supplier through the sharing of costs, risks, technical knowledge, decisions, information, and insight.  Risk reduction is an important consideration in this partnership in that a Title III investment is only undertaken when it is determined that the private sector is either unwilling or unable to assume the risks associated with the creation of a targeted capacity.

Under the authority of the DPA, any potential acquisition is restricted to sources with domestic R&D and production capabilities.  The principal objective of this effort is to develop and qualify a miniature refrigerant compressor that can be integrated into military and commercial cooling systems.  The successful awardee will seek to become a domestic market supplier of miniature compressors and achieve independent financial viability by addressing the needs of both government and commercial customers. 

The Title III Program Office is interested in developing a compressor that can generate a minimum of 300 watts of cooling capacity, weighs less than two (2) pounds, has a volume of less than 16 cubic inches, and can operate for a minimum of four (4) hours.  Contractors unable to meet these minimum technical requirements should not respond to this announcement. 

The government contemplates this project will consist of multiple phases.  In the initial phase, the contractor will document technical requirements and conduct a business case analysis.  The Government anticipates awarding a follow-on multi-phase contract incorporating the results provided from the initial phase effort.  Interested contractors should possess documented expertise and an existing capability in the development and production of miniature refrigerant compressor technologies.  Contractors should identify their interest and capability to respond to any potential requirement by submitting the information required under Note 25. 

All submitted information should be limited to no more than 25 pages, one-sided, minimum font size 10 and should be sent to Michele Tritt, Contract Negotiator, Det 1 AFRL/PKMT, Area B, Bldg 167, 2310 8th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7801 or via e-mail at michele.tritt@wpafb.af.mil by 14 December 2004 no later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.  Submittals via e-mail are preferred.  A responder may request clarification in writing for any requirement that is unclear from Anita Bailey, Contracting Officer, Det 1 AFRL/PKMT at (937) 656-7197 or by sending an e-mail to anita.bailey@wpafb.af.mil.  Technical questions regarding this sources sought announcement should be directed to Gene Himes, AFRL/MLMT at (937)-674-4356 or at gene.himes@wpafb.af.mil.  Any requests for clarification must be received no later than seven (7) business days prior to the close of this sources sought announcement in order to receive a timely response.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All routine communications regarding this announcement should be directed to the technical or contractual points of contact listed above.  All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency.  See Note(s): 25.

<RESPDATE>112204
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Janet L Stone, Contract Specialist,  843-218-5906
<DESC>Spawar Systems Center Charleston is requesting information from interested sources capable of providing a single consolidated imaging system (Document Capture System) that will be utilized for scanning 600,000 or more paper documents per day.  The scanning and imaging system design must be scalable, with minimal upgrade costs, to a daily production of 1,000,000 images per day.  The imaging system must produce a scanned image of archival quality that meets the National Archives federal requirements for scanned images.  The quality of documents to be scanned will vary and range in size from 2? x 3? business cards to 11? x 17? drawings.  The imaging system must be automated and maximize the use of available scanning technology to minimize the need for operator intervention and image manipulation. The system will be used twenty-four hours a day, during three eight-hour shifts, five days a week with a planned shift staff of: (1)   Shift Supervisor (1)   Systems Administrator (1)   Administrative Assistant (1)   Barcode/ Database Expert (15) Document Feed Preparers (8)   Scanning/Image Enhancement QA/Re-scan (15) OCR QA (15) Document Re-assembly Some of the technologies to be considered to obtain this production capability include Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) image capture software with the following features: 1)  Automated Quality Assurance (QA) ? Runs unattended and performs quality assessments on images, allows an operator to obtain page quality statistics and optionally route unacceptable and questionable pages to other modules or units for corrective processing without holding up the rest of the batch.  Automated QA should test for noise, skew, and orientation.  Automatic Noise test feature must check the image to ensure that characters are clearly distinguishable from speckles, and must check for character joins and disjoins.  Automatic skew detection must test black borders and primarily straight text lines and graphic elements that are either parallel with or perpendicular to the page edges for skew. 2)  Manual QA ? Images that fail the automated QA must be reviewable by an operator.  The system must give the operator the option to select images for rescan without holding up the rest of the batch and slowing production throughput. 3)  Automated Image Enhancement (AIE) ? Automatically processes batch images using different types of filters to improve image quality and detection filters to detect and read information in images. AIE applies filters to images based on a filter list that is user defined during setup.  Filters should include: Deskew Dilation Halftone removal Line removal Noise removal Smoothing Border removal Hole removal Patch code detection Blank page detection One-dimension (1D) bar code detection Two-dimension (2D) bar code detection 4)  Indexing - Allows for interactive image-based indexing, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) assisted indexing (select text on image populates index fields), and database validation that can be extended through DLLs.  Indexing must allow populating with Code 3 of 9 barcode type. 5)  Optical Character Recognition (OCR) ?The imaging software must integrate with 3rd party OCR products using an application program interface (API) or other optimized conduit.  OCR should use voting engines and omnifont technology to recognize nearly all non-stylized machine printed fonts including proportionally spaced and monospaced fonts, as well as text printed on a dot matrix printer.  Many of the documents to be scanned are dot matrix printer output and carbon copies. 6)  Exporters ?Modules/units designed to interface to 3rd party document management systems must be API level exporters that provide two-way communication with a separate Records Management database. Exporters include: Mandatory Exporter ASCII Text (.txt) Tagged Image File Format - TIFF (.tif) Portable Document Format (.pdf) Searchable Portable Document Format (.pdf) Joint Photographic Experts Group ? JPEG (.jpg) ODBC export (must support Oracle 9i database) Values to XML Optional Exporters Microsoft Sharepoint Documentum e-Content Server FileNET Panagon IS/CS compatible export 7)  Distributed Processing ? The imaging processes above must be distributable through a standard Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network.  System must support scanning images at remote locations and electronically transferring scanned images to central Records Management location for QA processing and indexing.  The distribution system shall not employ ?Sneaker-net? methods.  A single administrator should be able to monitor (document capture system status and associated processes) and administer all imaging software anywhere on the document capture system network. 8)  Reporting Statistics ? The system shall collect and store statistics and metadata to identify bottlenecks, tracking job statistics, and plan personnel staff for Document Capture System operations. Data to be collected include operator identity for each document batch, preparation time, scan time, QA time, reassembly time, document aging, and error reports.  The statistics must be exportable to a database. 9)  Security ? The system must use Windows domain or LDAP for user security.  System administrators must have the capability to add or delete user access to the system using a single interface. Scanner Specifications: 1)  Black and white scanners that meet the requirements of this RFI must individually feed and scan no less than 150 letter-size sheets per minute at an optical resolution of 200 DPI black and white including onionskin and card stock originals. 2)  Color scanners must feed and scan at a rated feed speed of no less than 20 inches per second with an optical resolution of 300 DPI color, full landscape documents intermixed with envelopes and folders with paper weights ranging 13lb to 30lb and sizes ranging from 2? x 3? to 11? x 17?. 3)  Scanners must have Automatic Doubles Detect feature to detect doubles of all paper weights and sizes when scanning documents intermixed with envelopes and folders with paper weights ranging from 13 lb to 30lb and sizes ranging from 2? x 3? to 11? x 17?. 4)  Scanner must have physical skew sensor components to automatically stop production prior to critical imaging when document skew tolerances are not met.  The scanner must perform deskew and autocropping. 5)  Scanner must capture up to four (4) images per scan. Additional Desirable Features: In-line hardware barcode scanner option In-line sorting bins option for removing job separator sheets Inkjet printer for pre-scan and post-scan This notice is for planning purposes only.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 518210 and the size standard is $21,000,000.00. Firms are invited to submit the appropriate documentation as described above in addition to any literature, brochures and references necessary to support that they possess the required capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements.  There is a limit of five (5) pages for the data submitted.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, Code 0216JS, at e-mail address janet.stone@navy.mil.

<CONTACT>Cynthia Jackson, Contract Specialist, (973)724-2244
<DESC>The U.S. Army, Office of the Project Manager, Maneuver Ammunition Systems, Picatinny, NJ is seeking sources for the manufacture and delivery of 5.56mm, M995 and 7.62mm, M993 Armor Piercing (AP) Cartridges.  These cartridges shall provide enhanced penetration capabilities against lightly armored vehicles and fortifications as compared to the standard 5.56mm, M855 and 7.62mm, M80 ball cartridges.  The 5.56mm, M995 will be used in the M16 rifle, the M4 carbine and the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon.  The 7.62mm, M993 will be used in the M240 and M60 Machine Guns and the M24 Sniper Rifle. There is no US Government Technical Data Package available for these items. These items will be procured in accordance with the US Government performance specifications for both the M995 & M993. (The M993 specification is currently being finalized - a draft version is available for review).Only those sources with AP cartridge designs that fully conform to all the requirements of the “Design Verification” section of the performance specification(s) shall be considered for award. Upon completion of design verification testing, the government shall review the results and determine if the design is verified or not. Only those designs determined to be verified by the government will be eligible for award. Interested sources without a previously verified design will be responsible to verify their cartridge design in accordance with the performance specification at their own expense. In order to be eligible for award, all verification efforts shall be complete and results approved by the government prior to the close of any solicitation. Copies of the M995 performance specification and the M993 draft performance specification  are available upon request (contact information is given below). In addition to the acquisition of the M995 and M993 Armor Piercing (AP) cartridges described above, the U.S. Army is also seeking sources that would be interested in acting as a prime system integration contractor for supplying the AP cartridges linked together with various tracer ammunition cartridges in 4:1 or 9:1 ratios in the final linked U.S. Military packaging configuration. This effort would require a contractor to manufacture and/or subcontract the manufacture of all of the necessary ammunition, links and packaging materials to deliver the items in the final prescribed packaging configurations. In this scenario, the two AP rounds would need to meet the same verification requirements as described above. All of the other items required in these contracts (7.62mm, M62 tracer; 7.62mm, M276 dim tracer; 5.56mm, M856 tracer; M13 links; M27 links; packaging materials, etc) would all need to fully comply with the complete US Army technical data package and quality assurance provisions for these items. The basic contract is planned for award in FY05 with a quantity of 2.4M 5.56mm M995 Cartridges and 4.3M 7.62mm M993 Cartridges. The contract is expected to include four option years (FY06-FY09) with a maximum total quantity amount of 23.4M 5.56mm, M995 Cartridges and 17.6M 7.62mm, M993 Cartridges.  Quantities are estimates only.  Delivery will be required within 180 days from contract award or 120 days from exercise of option.  Quantities for the system integrator contract shall be approximately 20% higher than the figures listed above, with the additional 20% representing either the 5.56mm or 7.62mm Tracer ammunition. All responsible interested sources are encouraged to submit their capabilities and M995 or M993 Verification status with regard to the above,  no later than 30 days from the initial publication of this notice, 17 Dec 04 by 4PM EST to:  Commander, U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC, ATTN:AMSTA-AQ-APF, Cynthia Jackson, Bldg. 9 Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 or atcjacks@pica.army.mil.  Please include company name, address, telephone number,and technical point of contact,brochures/literature. Firms interested insupplying the AP ammunition should adequately describe their experience insmall caliber production and testing, systems contracting, demonstrated highrate production, annual production capacity, and verification status of theirproposed design. Those sources not having previously verified designs, should also submit a rough outline of their plans and schedule to verify their design and shall submit any backup data to support claims that their design will conform to the performance specification requirements. Those contractors interested in the prime system integrator aspect of this announcement shall provide all pertinent information related to the ability to execute the effort. Firms shall provide verification status of the AP ammunition cartridges that will be supplied under this contract. Past experience and abilities of the supplier of the identified tracer ammunition and links shall be demonstrated. In addition, the ability and past experience related to acting as a prime contractor to procure, assemble and package the necessary components shall beprovided.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to questions asked that are relevant to all potential bidders as follows:

1.  QUESTION:
I see there are some changes to the SW cluster meeting date, whereby some dates are replaced with others. However, the new dates already existed in the first solicitation.  To confirm, are there still 13 cluster meetings with some repeat dates (i.e. July 11-14, Aug. 15-18 and July 18-21) OR are there only 10 SW cluster meetings in total?

RESPONSE:
Due to the previous conflict in dates please use the following dates when responding to this solicitation as follows:

AUSTIN, TX (4 Events): 
January 31-February 3, 2005
May 2-5, 2005
July 11-14, 2005
August 15-18, 2005

ALBUQUERQUE, NM (5 Events):
February 7-10, 2005
April 23-26, 2005
July 18-21, 2005
August 22-25, 2005
November 7-10, 2005

TRIBAL AND SUPERVISORS (6 Events):
Feb 20-22, 2005 (tribal) and Feb 22-25, 2005 (supervisors and tribal)
July 19-21, 2005 (tribal) and July 21-24, 2005 (supervisors and tribal)
Nov 13-15, 2005 (tribal) and Nov 15-18, 2005 (supervisors and tribal)

2.  QUESTION:
In the amendment it states to add dates for Tribal and Supervisors Meetings in the SW cluster, but I'm not sure where - is this Austin or Albuquerque?

RESPONSE:

The location for the Tribal and Supervisors meetings for the Southwest cluster will be held in Albuquerque, NM.

3.  QUESTION:
The meeting dates of July 19-22 are not designated to a location. Where is the 19-22 meeting being held?

RESPONSE:
Location:  Raleigh NC, July 19-22, 2004.

4.  QUESTION:
It looks like you want a full bid to include AV and F&B. We have a few questions about how you want that information presented:

Do you want F&B estimates on a per person basis or totals for each line item? Should the costs include the ++ charges (Service & Tax)? I assume you don't want menus at this time.

RESPONSE:
Part -1:  Yes- we would like F&B estimate on a per person basis and a total per line.  Part - 2:  No – the cost should not reflect service & tax charges because we are taxed exempt.  Part -3:  Yes – you may provide your menus at this time.

5.  QUESTION:
I have the same questions for A/V. Do you want totals - per day or per event - or do you want line items. Should totals include the ++ charges (Service & Tax)?

RESPONSE:
Part -1:  We would like to have totals on a per day basis and a total per event.  Part - 2:  No – the cost should not reflect service & tax charges because we are taxed exempt.

6.  QUESTION:
Are we up against an incumbent for this bid?  And if so, are you able to share the details of the existing contract?

RESPONSE:
No – there are no incumbents for this solicitation.

7.  QUESTION:
Please forward us a conference history list in areas of AmeriCorps*VISTA “RFP” HQKMR0503’s proposed cluster cities (Contact Names, Addresses, Telephones numbers, etc.)

RESPONSE:
At this present time we can only provide the following information to help narrow down the search for information pertaining to the 6 cluster requirements as follows:

-Headquarters (Washington, DC):  Only vendors in the National Airport and Downtown areas of Washington, DC.
-Atlantic:  Only vendors in the Philadelphia, PA and Wilmington, DE areas.

-Southern:  Only vendors in the Metro area of Charlotte, NC, Downtown/Airport area of Atlanta, GA, Waterfront areas of Virginia, and Nashville, TN.
-Southwest:  Only vendors in the Austin, TX and Albuquerque, NM areas.

8.  QUESTION:
I wanted to see if their is the potential to expand the Pacific Cluster to include San Diego, we represent the Town & Country, or the Southwest Cluster, we represent the Riviera in Las Vegas.

RESPONSE:
No – Only vendors in the Salt Lake City and Provo, UT; San Francisco and Los Angles, CA, Portland, OR and Seattle, WA areas.

9.  QUESTION:
With regards to your (SOW) on Southwest Cluster (Austin, TX & Albuquerque, NM), your lodging/meeting/supply needs were specified for the months of July and August; however, your needs for meetings to be held in January 31-February 3, May 2-5 and December 5-8, 2005 were not specifically stated for Austin Texas events.

NOTE:  The same holds true for NM Event Cluster for months of February 7-10, 2005 as amended.  Please E-mail us all follow-up information, so that we can address and meet all of your information regarding names of cities/hotels which met the same lodging/meeting/supply needs for year 2004.

RESPONSE:
Please use the format provide for the months of July and August for the meetings to be held in January 31-February 3, May 2-5 and December 5-8, 2005 for the Austin, TX.  The same will apply to the Albuquerque, NM meeting requirements.
