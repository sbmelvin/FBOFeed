<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization,  PL8221, Scott AFB IL, intends to issue a sole source contract to AT&T Government Solutions, 1900 Gallows Road, Vienna, VA 22182, for Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Transmission Services - CONUS (DTS-C) Access Optimization (A/O) services.  The proposed contract will provide transmission and bandwidth manager services currently being provided under Contract No. DCA200-97-D-0048, DTS-C, and DCA200-96-D-0096, Defense Switched/Bandwidth Manager Services - CONUS (DS/BMS-C), respectively.  No change will occur at the user locations; user sites will be rehomed to AT&T Points-of-Presence(POPs)/Bandwidth Managers serving the new DISN Core. This will result in a reduction in access/egress OC-3 connections from 35 bandwidth managers and approximately 4,400 circuits to eight new DISN Core and 19 ESONET connections from AT&T's network. This bridge contract will provide continued DISN transmission services until the follow-on DISN Access Transport Services (DATS) contract is awarded and circuits can be transitioned from the DTS-C A/O contract to the DATS.  

Place of Performance is various U.S. Government and contractor facilities within CONUS.  The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a period of performance of  a 12-month base period with two 1-year option periods.  This action is critical to ensure continuation of telecommunications services that support the CONUS sustaining base information infrastructure and allow continuation of telecommunication services.  To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DOD cannot afford any disruption of these telecommunications services.  Follow-on actions for replacement services are in process within the DISN Next Generation Program Office through the competitive DATS Request for Proposal.   AT&T is the only contractor that can provide support at the level required in the timeframe available.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  North American Association Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) Code 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers, applies.  See numbered note 22.  Points of contact are Carrie Ross, email Carrie.Ross@disa.mil or June Tharp, email June.Tharp@disa.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is developing an overall  plan to improve its records management process, develop portals in support of communities of interest, and increase overall effectiveness and timeliness of records management programs.  As part of this effort, there is a current need for a contractor to provide  subject matter experts to conduct a 4-month study base lining and evaluating existing procedures, organization, equipment, personnel, applicable directives, and training associated with the records management at DARPA.  After the contractor has evaluated the existing records management system, it will make recommendations on new, or changes to, procedures, equipment, personnel, organization, and training to effect a more responsive records management system with growth potential.  This announcement is a follow-on to RFI SN 05-17 (Task 3) posted to FedBizOpps (FBO) on 20 DEC 2004.  Evaluation of responses to that RFI has resulted in a determination to make this RFQ a 100% set-aside for service-disabled veteran-owned (SDVO) small business concerns.  NAICS code 541611/SBA size standard of $6 million applies.  DARPA anticipates the award of a firm-fixed-price purchase order.  Current Secret Clearance is desired but not required.  Place of Performance will be off-site from DARPA but the contractor will require numerous visits to DARPA.  Escorts will be provided during the study.  Access  to the DARPA network is not required for this study.  RFQ HR0011-06-Q-0001 will be made available for download via this FBO website on or about 15 days from publication of this notice with a closing date on or about 30 days thereafter.  All responsible SDVO small business concerns that submit a quotation will be considered by the Agency.  It is the responsibility of potential quoters to check the FBO site to access the RFQ.  This solicitation will be available in electronic format only.  No telephone, faxed, e-mailed, or mailed requests will be accepted.  Questions prior to issuance of the RFQ will be accepted by e-mail only.

Subject to the limitations of the above-listed authorities and additional conditions and limitations as described further in the solicitation package, the DoN will contribute up to $37 million, 722 existing DoN owned and occupied military unaccompanied housing units including related improvements, and a leasehold interest in unimproved land for the construction of new units and support facilities in Norfolk, Virginia. The private partner (managing member) will secure debt and contribute equity, as needed, over the project lifetime and, acting on behalf of the partnership, will accomplish the following: 

·	Own, operate, manage and maintain the existing on-base inventory of 1,313 beds (722 units) of DoN-owned military unaccompanied housing with a minimum end state inventory of 2,763 beds (1,447 apartments), including certain streets and selected infrastructure, and ancillary facilities, for a minimum term of 50 years (see Appendices 2 and 3); and,

·	Design, finance, construct and furnish/equip a minimum of 725 new, market-style two-bedroom/two-bathroom apartments on DoN-provided land and land provided by the City of Newport News, VA, including parking and site amenities (see Appendices 3 and 5). 

o	A portion of the new units must be built in Norfolk on Camp Allen land and/or on Camp Elmore land and a portion of the new units must  be built in Newport News on the land provided by the City of Newport News.

o	Examples of desired amenities are club house/mixed use buildings, recreational facilities (basketball/volleyball/tennis courts), passive recreational areas, food service amenities, irrigation systems, and open landscaped spaces.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic, Norfolk, VA utilizing a two-step “Best Value” process, will conduct the evaluations and make the selection of the PPV partner. An Invitation for Offers (IFO), containing a Statement of Qualifications (SOQ) and an Invitation for Proposals (IFP), will be used. 

Step 1- Statement of Qualifications (SOQ):  Interested parties are requested to submit a Statement of Qualifications (SOQ) describing their overall concept for development and their approach to the operation and management of the project; statements describing past performance with regard to developments of a similar nature, scope and scale; and statements describing financial capability/capacity are required. The DoN evaluation will include the offeror’s concept and approach, past performance, and capability and capacity for the project.  DoN officials will review the Step 1 SOQ, and may meet with any or all of the respondents, and may request additional information on particular aspects of the information submitted. Based on its evaluation, the DoN will invite not more than four (4) offerors to respond to the Step 2, IFP. 

Step 2- Invitation for Proposals (IFP):  Proposals submitted will consist of written technical and financial proposals, and may be followed by oral presentations. DoN officials will review proposals to the Step 2 IFP, may meet with any or all offerors, and may request additional information on particular aspects of the material submitted. Upon completion of its evaluation, the DoN will select the one (1) offer that, in the DoN’s opinion, provides the “best value” for the overall project, and will designate the offeror to a period of exclusive negotiations. 
During this period of exclusive negotiations, the designated offeror will:  (i) work towards finalization of required project and environmental documentation; (ii) pursue local approvals; (iii) develop design plans and working drawings; and, (iv) reach an agreement with DoN officials regarding all aspects of the project. The intent of the exclusive negotiations is to enter into a Business Agreement that describes all relevant characteristics of the development, and defines all business terms and conditions, schedules and financial arrangements between the parties. Certain rights reserved by the DoN with regard to this period of exclusive negotiations are found in Section E of the IFO, “Special Conditions and Limitations.”
 
Inasmuch as this selection will result in an investment in a Public/Private Venture, or similar business entity, the selection is not governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  However, certain provisions have been selected for administrative purposes or incorporated into this offering to comply with statute.

Seed - The seed will be furnished by the Government at the location stated in the Detailed Specifications.  Contractor shall load and transport seed from the pickup point to the operational loading sites and shall be responsible for its protection from loss or damage due to weather, rodents, insects, theft, or any other hazard.  Any seed damaged or lost, while in the custody of the Contractor, will be replaced by the Government, and actual cost to the Government for replacement will be deducted from payments due the Contractor.  All unused seed shall be returned to the pickup point by the Contractor or nearer destination, if so directed, upon completion of work or termination of the contract.  All empty seed bags shall be tied in bundles of 25 bags each and returned to the Government by the Contractor.

The system shall be sufficiently sensitive to provide immediate deviation indications (real-time).  The DGPS system must be capable of determining a differentially corrected location with an error of no more than one to two meters in the horizontal plane.  The guidance system shall be capable of updating current position at a rate of a minimum of one time per second.  Differential correction must cover the complete operational area.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541519.   This is a notice of intent, not a Request for Quotation or solicitation.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, WA for the renewal of Microsoft Premier Support, Account Number 64494. Microsoft Premier Support includes the following services: 1) Service elements, 2) Problem resolution support, and 3) Information services and workshops. Service elements includes: 1) up to 200 hours of service resource time, 2) SAM and SA hours, which can be used for infrastructure support assistance, reviews, development support assistance, and lab, 3) planning and resource facilitation, 4) status meetings and reporting, and 5) escalation management. The problem resolution support includes 1) fifty (50) support incidents, 2) hot fixes, 3) critical problem alerts, and 4) multi-vendor coordination. The information services and workshops include 1) newsflashes and 2) unlimited-user service desk license, which includes one (1) prepaid site visit (up to 2-days, NA only), one (1) Microsoft TechNet Plus Subscription (single server), and one (1) MSDN Subscription. Microsoft Premier Support from Microsoft provides direct and quick access to internal Microsoft software developers and source codes for current and future products twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. The BOP requires such resources because system failures that are not resolved quickly could jeopardize the safe and secure operation of BOP institutions. Purchasing support from a reseller or a third party vendors do not be meet the BOPs requirements, as the BOP would not have direct access to Microsoft source code and developers, which are essential for the immediate access the BOP needs to resolve system failures that may impact the operations of our institutions. This proposed noncompetitive action will be processed in accordance with FAR 13. BOP plans to issue this requirement as a firm fixed price purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, which will be awarded to Microsoft Corporation, ArrowPoint 2, 8050 Microsoft Way, Charlotte, NC 28273. The period of performance will be from November 27, 2005 to November 26, 2006.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Any information shall be clearly marked with Reference: NAS-0071-2005 and must be received on or before November 18, 2005 by 4:00 PM local time (Washington DC). Any information not received by the date/time and at the location specified in this notice will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Point of Contact for all information regarding this acquisition is Joe Rofrano, Contract Specialist, or Greg Sinsel, Contract Specialist, at the address and phone numbers listed below.

<CONTACT>Sheila E. Rushlow Contract Specialist 3016638206     sheila_rushlow@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service, Historic Preservation Training Center, is soliciting quotations to provide the services of a crane and operator for twelve working days, February 27, 2006 through March 16, 2006, at the USS Cairo Museum site located at Vicksburg National Military Park, Vicksburg, MS.  The crane shall have the capacity to lift the existing barrel tubes off the original carriages and hold them suspended while the originals are removed and replacement carriages installed under the tubes.  Four guns are located on the starboard side of the boat; two are located on the stern, four on the port, and three on the bow for a total of thirteen guns.  The second gun on the starboard side of the boat has already been changed and will not need to be lifted.  The process of lifting these tubes will be difficult due to the location of the carriages on the boat frame which is not a solid platform, and the side armor plating through which some of the gun barrels protrude.  Gun carriages are large (approximately 3' x  6') and heavy 700-800lbs., yet they have a fragile surface.  The barrels weigh between 3,550 lbs - 8,465 lbs., the lengths are between 106" and 129".  The lifting of these barrels will require different riggings and connections depending on the location of the carriage.  The operator will have to navigate the crane's boom under the protective permanent tarp that covers the boat.  The National Park Service crew will construct temporary work platforms around each carriage, remove the cap square holding the tube, remove the existing carriage while being held by the crane and install the new replacement carriage.  The crane operator shall then lower the tube on the new carriages.  The guns on the stern of the boat will be lifted off and rested on the ground and the carriages will be lifted off with the crane and the replacement carriages will be lifted on with the crane.  This is necessary due to the structural timbers in the stern of the boat.  The crane and operator will take different amounts of time to construct the deck work areas around it.  The crane operator shall supply all rigging and connectors.  The crane operator shall ensure the lift capacity of all rigging and connectors used for each barrel.  The Contractor shall use protective material to distribute the weight of the crane to prevent damage to the brick pavers which surround the boat.  The crane operator shall observe the general requirements of 1926.550-Supbart N-Cranes, and Derricks of OSHA.  The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed price contract on or before December 30, 2005.  The Request for Quotation with be issued electronically on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  Offerors interested in the doing business, and receiving a copy of the Quotation must on the Fed Biz Opps (www.fedbizopps.gov).  The Solicitation with specifications shall be posted on or about December 5, 2005.  NO HARD COPIES OF THE PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED. Written quotations shall be submitted to the address identified in the Solicitation package on or before 12:00 p.m. local prevailing time on December 19, 2005.

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provides personnel investigative services to Federal agencies and the Department of Defense (DOD).  One of the primary missions of OPM is the Background Investigation (BI) Program which includes law enforcement record searches.  BIs are required to determine an individual's eligibility for access to classified information, assignment to, or retention in positions with sensitive duties, eligibility for public trust positions, or other designated duties requiring such investigation.  These investigations often involve details of the individual's life and must be conducted with tact and discretion.  Information collected as parts of BIs is protected under the Privacy Act of 1974.   

The work performed will be limited to non-personal services as augmentation support to the BI program.  This work is to be performed in direct support of the OPM.  The purpose of this contract is to obtain the services of personnel to conduct quality law enforcement record searches from existing database terminals as part of background investigations. The record searchers must update PIPS (Personnel Investigations Processing System), complete the investigative voucher, or provide printouts to OPM.   The Independent Contractor must be able to conduct work, law enforcement record searches, within at the designated terminals in the state of South Carolina. This contract is designated as a small business set aside to be conducted by one or more record searchers in South Carolina. 

Interested parties that believe they can meet these requirements must submit complete information demonstrating they can meet these requirements and representative pricing for providing these services.  Such information must be submitted within ten days of publication of this notice.

This is not a request for quotations but rather a notice to determine if there are other sources that can meet the Government's requirements.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The proposed action consists of the placement of approximately 60,000 cubic yards of beach quality material consisting of less than five (5) percent silt along 2,500 linear feet of the estuarine shoreline of South Core Banks, Cape Lookout National Sh oreline, in the vicinity of the Cape Lookout Lighthouse and associated historic structures.  The project area has been split into two separate reaches, divided by the existing pier and dock, defined as the Northern Fill Area and the Southern Fill Area.  Th e Northern Fill Area extends approximately 1,000 linear feet northward from the existing pier, transitioning into the existing shoreline.  The width of this area is limited to the available area between the existing beach and the existing deep-water slough  that hugs the shoreline in this area.  The maximum width in this area is approximately 50 feet.  The elevation of the beach fill will tie into the existing beach elevation, estimated to be approximately 3.5 feet National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD).  T he Southern Fill Area extends approximately 1,600 linear feet southward from the existing pier, transitioning into the existing shoreline.  The maximum width in this area is approximately 100 feet.  The beach fill will tie into the existing beach elevation , estimated to be approximately 3.5 NGVD.  To provide added protection to the lighthouse and historic structures, a berm is proposed along the southern fill area.  The berm would be constructed for a distance of approximately 1,250 feet, at a height of app roximately 7.5 feet NGVD, and a top elevation of 15 feet.  No berm is proposed for the northern fill area.  Dredging of material from the federal channel will be performed by a hydraulic pipeline dredge to the depth of -7 feet mean-low-water (mlw) with an allowable -2 feet overdepth.  The formation of the sand berm and placement of the beachfill will be completed by bulldozers and other earth moving equipment.  The magnitude of this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

<DESC>This amendment 0001 is being issued to clarify and answer questions from potential offerors concerning the NOAA Weather Radio Maintenance Transmitter Solicitation.

NOAA Weather Radio Transmitter Maintenance Solicitation DG133W-06-RP-0001
Offerors Questions and Government Responses

1.  When old transmitters are replaced who is responsible for removal and disposition?    

A.  In some cases parts may be retrieved from displaced transmitters, tested, and stocked with the contractor to provide better support for those remaining in service.  That decision will be made by the Government with recommendations provided by the contractor.  All equipment not so retained will be disposed of by the Government.  The Government may enlist the assistance of the contractor through a Service Order on a case by case basis.

2.  At what rate will the old transmitters be replaced?

A.  The Government’s estimate is identified in Section B tables in the Solicitation.

3.  What electronic tube is used in the SRS Power Amplifier and how is it configured in the circuit?

A.  The service manual for the SRS 1000W transmitter lists the tube as “Type 8877/3CX1500A7”.  The tube currently in use is the YU209 tube from Richardson Electronics that has been tested on an SRS Power Amplifier on loan to the manufacturer.  The tube is tested for proper current levels prior to shipment.  The tube is a triode connected with a grounded grid.

4.  When the ROAMS unit detects a problem who does it call?

A.  The ROAMS units have room to store up to four different phone numbers.  If contact fails for the first number it will call the second and so on.  Currently the majority of ROAMS units call the Weather Forecast Office that is responsible for its transmitter’s proper operation.  There are about 150 units that have been configured to call a central  monitoring system which in turn filters the alarm data and calls the Forecast Office with an evaluation of the problem (but not down to the module level).  In either case it is the Forecast Office that makes the final decision to call for a repair technician based on the data provided.

5.  Do the transmitter manufacturers make the ROAMS units?

A.  No.  The ROAMS have been built under contract by an electronics firm and provided as Government Furnished Equipment to the transmitter manufacturers for installation in each transmitter system prior to shipment.

6.  Will the new transmitters used to replace old ones be Crown or Armstrong?

A.  The Government has yet to determine the method of acquiring those transmitters.  At this time there is no guarantee as to the makes or models of replacement transmitter systems.

7.  What cavity is used on the SRS transmitters?

A.  A cylindrical single stage band pass cavity usually made by Cellwave is used on the SRS transmitters.  The cavity has an adjustment knob to optimize matching to the antenna cable.

8.  Do the signal strength surveys identified in the solicitation require the use of a 30 foot antenna pole to assure free field measurement of the signal?

A.  The Government recognizes the problems that would result trying to make an accurate measurement in a full coverage area survey.  The most important factor is to be able to make the measurements consistently from one time to the next.  The signal strength level is needed but is recognized to be an estimate based on the measurement methods used.  An important factor of the survey is to identify changes in signal and or pattern of broadcast, hence the need for consistent measurements.

9. At the top of Page 8 of the solicitation completion of SF33 is stated is this correct.?

A. No this is incorrect should have stated SF1449.

10.  Is there an incumbent Contractor?  If so who is the incumbent, what is the contract number, contract type, award date and the duration and total value ?

A. Independent Technology, Inc., DG133W02CQ0012, Fixed Price (some T&A),  07/30/2005, three (3) years and $9.9M.

11. Is subcontracting portions of the work allowed, and are there restrictions with regard to whether or not the subcontractor is a small business.

A. Subcontracting is allowed but final decision resides with the prime if any is needed.  The subcontractor does not need to be a small business as long as the portion is less than 49%.

12. What is the Incentive Fee?

A.  The fee/profit paid to the Contractor of this contract will have a portion that is fixed and the remainder of the fee earned will be determined by the overall performance of the contractor as an additional incentive fee.   As noted in the solicitation you may propose an incentive fee by percentage in addition to the fixed fee you propose in the Schedule.  Keep in mind that your incentive fee could be different each semi annual period based upon your performance against the metrics to be established in the contract.  In simple terms the amount of your incentive fee may differ from period to period due to the Government’s evaluation of your performance of your ability to perform the duties in the contract.

13. The attachments that indicate usage of parts state the numbers are “year to date” but do not specify when and for what period of time they are for.

A. The attachments showing usage were generated from data covering the period August 01, 2004 through December 31, 2004.  Therefore, this data covers five months of usage.

14. Page 2 state that the quantity for the CLINS in the base year is twelve (12) is that correct.

A.  No that is not correct the quantity should be nine (9) as the base period of the contract will be a nine month period not twelve.(Closes Amendment 0001)  

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Weather Service (NWS) intends to acquire Maintenance and Logistical support for the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) Transmitter Network via Solicitation No DG133W06RP0001.   A  NWR system consists of an audio control console located by NOAA Weather Forecast Offices.  The transmitter systems, including antenna and transmission line are located at a remote site usually collocated with and hosted by a commercial or educational TV/radio transmitter and tower with a communication link (telephone line, microwave or UHF link) between the two locations.  The Offeror selected for award will provide scheduled regular service maintenance, including on-site repairs, emergency and non-emergency miscellaneous services, logistical support, and depot repairs for approximately 381 transmitter locations throughout the United States.  In addition, the Offeror selected will provide logistical support and depot repairs for approximately 430 other transmitters at various locations throughout the United States.  Other services to be included in the contract are equipment modifications, the storage and replenishment of spare parts, antenna repair, RF signal testing, locating suitable antenna sites and installation and relocation of equipment.  The transmitters associated with the sites were manufactured by Scientific Radio Systems, Inc. (SRS), Energy Onix (EO), Crown Broadcast (IREC) and Armstrong Transmitter Co.  There is a possibility that the number of sites will increase during the life of the contract.   At this time, the exact size of the increase is unknown.  In addition, some of the logistical/ depot sites could be converted to full service maintenance sites during the life of the contract, but, the exact number is unknown at this time.  Plus, some of the transmitters will be replaced each year with newer units.  At this time the exact number of replacements is unknown.

The Government anticipates awarding a Commercial Fixed Price Incentive Fee Performance Based Service contract (with a small percentage of the total value being on a Time and Materials (T&M) basis).   The period of performance for the contract will a base period  of nine (9) months and four (4) twelve month option periods for a total of fifty-seven (57) months, including a Phase-In and Phase- Out periods, if necessary.  Contract performance is anticipated to begin March 01, 2006.  The services required in this procurement have been successfully provided in the past by small businesses.  Accordingly, this follow-on procurement will be conducted as a total small business set-aside.  Affirmative written proposals must be received by the Contract Specialist, at 1325 East West Highway, Suite 17349, SSMC 2, Silver Spring, MD 20910, no later than 30 days, November 30, 2005, after the publication of this notice.  The Request for Proposal will be available in the near future via the Internet at the following site:  www.ofa.noaa.gov/amd/.  Any and all questions from Offerors must be submitted in writing no later than ten (10) days, November 10, 2005, after the publication of this notice.   See note 1 and 26.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-USAC-1

<CONTACT>Wilma Mooney, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-418-1865, Fax 202-418-5963, Email wilma.mooney@fcc.gov
<DESC>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed that all providers of interstate telecommunications services contribute to a federal universal service support mechanism in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner and that there be specific, predictable, and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has by federal regulation designated the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) to administer the universal service support mechanisms for schools, libraries, rural health care providers, high cost areas, and low income consumers.  USAC manages the Universal Service Fund (USF) in its administration of these support mechanisms.
In its role as Administrator, USAC has the responsibility to take measures to prevent, deter and detect waste, fraud, and abuse involving the USF and the universal support mechanisms, and to report to the FCC and Congress regarding actions to prevent waste, fraud and abuse.  In fulfilling its responsibilities, USAC works closely with the FCC Office of Inspector General (OIG).  The oversight responsibility of the FCC OIG is to independently detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse with respect to all FCC programs, including the USF.  USAC, in consultation with the OIG, developed the requirements of this Request for Proposals (RFP).  The purpose of this procurement is to conduct beneficiary audits that will enable USAC, in consultation with FCC OIG, to:  (1) detect waste, fraud, and abuse by beneficiaries of the universal service support mechanisms, (2) deter waste, fraud, and abuse by beneficiaries of the universal service support mechanisms, (3) generate insights about the compliance of beneficiaries with applicable law and the quality of administration of the universal service support mechanisms, and (4) identify areas for improvement in the compliance of beneficiaries with applicable law and the administration of the universal service mechanisms.  The preliminary estimated number of audits to be performed nationwide in the first year, under this procurement is approximately 700.  The estimated number of audits is sufficient to calculate an estimated error rate of improper payments in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance regarding the Improper Payment Information Act (IPIA).  Audits shall be conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Audit Standards (GAAS), Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), and Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), Public Law 107-300.  The RFP also requires offerors to have the capability to provide investigative support services.  
This contracting action replaces a prior USAC competitive procurement for these audit services that commenced in November 2004.  All previous offerors are encouraged to submit proposals.  In addition, new offerors are also invited to submit proposals.  

It is anticipated that this solicitation will result in multiple awards to allow for competition between the awardees for specific task orders.  Awarded contracts will have a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  It is anticipated that fixed price task orders will be awarded for audit services and labor hour task orders will be awarded for investigative services.  Due to the number of potential relationships between offerors and contributors, service providers, and/or beneficiaries of the USF, offerors will be required to disclose any actual or potential personal or organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs), as well as their process for identifying and evaluating potential or actual OCIs.  A mitigation plan shall be required if an actual or potential conflict of interest is identified by disclosure or other means.  It should be noted that if an offeror’s proposed mitigation plan is deemed to be inadequate to avoid, neutralize, or adequately mitigate an identified actual or potential OCI, then the offeror’s proposal will be subject to disqualification without further evaluation. 
The deadline for submission of proposals will be stated in the RFP.  Late and non-responsive proposals shall not be evaluated or considered for award.
Copies of the RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.universalservice.org no earlier than 15 days after publication of this synopsis, or can be requested by FAX at 202-776-0080, or by phone at 202-776-0200.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not commit the government, the Navy, or NAVAIR to any course of action following the completion of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). This RFI is to assist Whitney, Bradley and Brown (WBB) to identify and characterize available/viable alternatives to replace end of life/ageing C2A and MH53E aircraft. Both platforms perform either Carrier On Board Delivery (COD) and/or Vertical Onboard Delivery (VOD) missions for the Navy. The goal of this RFI is to seek industry inputs that address performance and outline the potential cost for replacement platforms to fulfill future missions. The Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will use the Airborne Resupply/Logistics for Seabasing (AR/LSB) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) as a tool to assess fixed and/or rotary wing candidates to meet the ICD COD/VOD capabilities. The solution may be either a single aircraft or a mixed fleet. Candidate aircraft(s) may be commercial or government off the shelf (COTS, GOTS) suitable for the VOD mission, or new development aircraft for COD and/or VOD. At a minimum the AoA will consider the following types of aircraft: MH-53E FLEX SLEP; C-2B, HV-22; New start COD, COTS or GOTS VOD; New Start VOD; COD and VOD Combination; COD, VOD, and HV-22 Combination; and Joint Vertical Aircraft Task Force Joint Heavy Lift vehicles. Responses should include best performance data available and note where upgrades, modifications, or new series are relevant. Cost data should be a rough order of magnitude (ROM). Proprietary or restricted information should be marked as such and will be appropriately safeguarded. Based on the information above and the assumptions listed below, responders are requested to provide the following information directly to WBB at the address listed below: 

1. Statement of willingness to participate and provide information needed by the AoA Team to evaluate the aircraft’s suitability to the mission. 
2. A general concept of operations outlining how the platform would be employed to provide the required capability. 
3. Performance data to include range, payload, cube, and maximum dimensions for large items. 
4. Cost data to include ROM estimates for EMD (Engineering, Manufacturing & Development) costs, Production costs with any contractual assumptions (e.g.; multiyear procurement, economic order quantities, minimum sustaining rate, etc.), and Operating & Support Costs. 
Assumptions
Aircraft have communications suite comparable to current USN and USMC sea-based aircraft. Intent of this assumption is to factor the weight, power, and cooling to include growth into the performance data. A ROM estimate based on engineering estimate is acceptable. 
Aircraft meet military specifications. This applies to COTS aircraft. COTS aircraft performance should factor weight increase to meet military and mission standards. A ROM factor based on engineering estimate or regression analysis of other conversions is acceptable. 
Aircraft can be rapidly configured for all cargo, all passengers, or a mix. 
Fixed wing (COD type) aircraft operate only to/from CVN class ships. 
MH-60S aircraft provide VERTEP lift within the Strike Groups. One MH-60S squadron is assigned to the Carrier Strike Group. An MH-60S detachment supports an Expeditionary Strike Group. 
Aircraft are capable of deploying with a Strike Group and operating from an LHD or CVN as a minimum. 

Responses in the format below should be mailed directly to: Whitney, Bradley & Brown, Inc. C/O Mr. William M. Mulholland, 1604 Spring Hill Rd., Suite 200, Vienna, VA 22182 Phone: 703-448-6081 (ext 337) Fax: 703-245-4709 Email:wmulholland@wbbinc.com

<DESC>Market Survey: Sources are sought that can provide or equal products for brand name components as described below.  The New York District intends to solicit and award a construction project for McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey entitled new Electrical Distribution S ystem.  The project itself will be solicited competitively under a future solicitation.  However, the project may potentially include  three brand name components.  This notification serves three purposes:  1) To notify potential offerors of the Government s intent to specify three brand name components under a future construction project; (2) To identify potential sources that can provide any or all of the brand name items; and (3) Notification of the Governments intent to brand name specify resultant pro ducts or systems.  A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval (J&A) for sole sourcing the resultant product(s) or system(s) in the event an or equal product is not submitted for consideration.  In such ins tances the brand name  or equal component will be embedded in the construction project that will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the project requiring  brand name components will be sole source if no sources are able to provide an or equal pr oduct.  Suppliers will be providing the brand name component to the contractor under the future solicitation for the construction of the project, not directly to the Government.  In the event no or equals  exist, the brand name justifications will be iss ued pursuant to FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source. Description of Work: The products included in this market survey are associated with the installation of a new substation and switchgear for the new Electrical Distribution System project at McGuire Air Force Base, NJ.  This project will install a new 38/15-kV Primary Unit Sub station to serve the new underground distribution in the 2200, 2300, 2400, 3100, and 3600 Areas.  The following brand name components are planned to be installed in the new substation: 1.	Two Cutler Hammer, Model Number 380-VCP-W32-1200, 38-kV breakers and nine Cutler Hammer , Model Number 150-VCP-W1000-1200, 15-kV breakers and the associated metal clad switchgear to house them. 2.	Nine ABB type DPU protective relays and two ABB type TPU transformer protective relays. 3.	One Monaco Model BT2-8 fire alarm transmitter. The existing main switching station and Substation No. 3 already utilize Cutler Hammer 38-kV and 15-kV substation class circuit breakers and ABB solid state control relays (DPU-2000R and TPU-2000R) for the protection of the 38 and 15-kV equipment.  These r elays are multifunction programmable units which serve both as circuit protection devices and data access devices for the proposed base-wide power monitoring network.  To allow for the full integration of the proposed monitoring system, the existing ABB co ntrol relays and the new control relays will be integrated together.  The fire departments remote monitoring equipment at McGuire Air Force Base is a Monaco Model D-700.  The existing substation fire alarm equipment as well as the bases various facilitie s, all incorporate Monaco Model BT2-8 fire alarm transmitters. Summary of Requirement: Two 38-kV and nine 15-kV substation class citcuit breakers and the associated metal clad switchgear to house them are required.  The circuit breakers are to be interchangeable with the existing Cutler Hammer 38-kV breakers, Model Number 380-VCP-W32-1200 an d the existing Cutler Hammer 15-kV breakers, Model Number 150-VCP-W1000-1200.  For a breaker to be considered interchangeable no external wiring modifications to it will be permitted.  The new breakers must be interchangeable so that only one type of repla cement parts and maintenance tools need to be maintained.  Additionally, in the event of circuit breaker failure, spare circuit breakers from the existing substation could be utilized to restor e power quickly. Nine protective relays and two transformer protective relays are required.  The protective relays are to be interchangeable with the existing ABB type DPU protective relays.  The transformer protective relays are to be interchangeable with the existing ABB  type TPU transformer protective relays.  For a relay to be considered interchangeable it must utilize a common programming software.  The new relays must be interchangeable so that they can be integrated with the existing ABB relays for the proposed base- wide power monitoring network.  Also, only one type of replacement parts and maintenance tools need to be maintained, and the ability to utilize existing spare relay equipment in the event of failure is preserved.   One fire alarm transmitter is required.  The fire alarm transmitter must be compatible with and capable to communicate with the bases existing Monaco Model D-700 remote monitoring fire alarm. Any supplier wishing to provide an or equal for the  Cutler Hammer, Model Number 380-VCP-W32-1200, 38-kV breakers (with associated metal clad switchgear), the Cutler Hammer, Model Number 150-VCP-W1000-1200, 15-kV breakers (with associated metal clad swit chgear), the ABB type DPU protective relays, the ABB type TPU transformer protective relays, or the Monaco Model BT2-8 fire alarm transmitter must provide supporting data to the Contracting Officer no later than 05 December 2005 to Anne Spiegelberg, U.S. a rmy Corps of Engineers, New York District, Contracting Division, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1843, New York, NY, 10278-0090.  This is a market survey and sources sought only.  This is a notification of the Governments intent to incorporate brand name component s for the  project.  The Government does not intend to solicit these components as stand-alone, independent contract actions.  This is not a request to respond to a solicitation.

<SUBJECT>A -- DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED MICROFABRICATED ATOMIC CLOCKS
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Time and Frequency Division proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Notre Dame for the development of advanced microfabricated atomic clocks.  The NIST Optical Frequency Measurements group has a program on chip-scale atomic clocks (CSAC) to design, build and characterize miniature vapor-cell atomic frequency references based on fabrication techniques traditionally used in the field of microelectronics and micro-electric-mechanical systems (MEMS). The NIST Optical Frequency Measurements group is currently building structures that are the size of a grain of rice (V < 10 mm3) and could run on an AA battery (dissipate < 75 mW). These atomic clocks are stable enough that they neither gain nor lose more than ten millionths of a second over the course of one day and are paving the way for atomic-level timekeeping in portable, battery-operated systems such as global positioning receivers and wireless communications.
The specific tasks to be carried out by the Notre Dame researchers will be as follows:
1.	Construction of a chip-scale atomic clock physics package based on existing NIST technology with a size below 20 mm3, a power dissipation below 100 mW and a fractional frequency instability below 10-11 at one hour of integration. This task is expected to be carried out in close collaboration with researchers at the NIST-Boulder facility.
2.	Evaluation of the performance of chip-scale atomic clock devices developed by NIST with regard to long-term frequency instability, power dissipation and reliability.
3.	Implementation of chip-scale atomic clock physics package designs modified based on the evaluation of initial structures to achieve lower power dissipation and improved long-term frequency stability.
Because of the advanced and collaborative nature of the work, the contractor must be familiar with the following:
1.	Design, fabrication and testing of alkali vapor cells based on lithographically-defined structures etched in Silicon wafers.
2.	Assembly of vertically-integrated atomic clock structures based on microfabricated vapor cells including knowledge of relevant bonding techniques, alignment processes and thermo-mechanical properties of the structural components.
3.	Control parameters affecting the long-term stability of chip-scale atomic frequency references.
4.	Operational details of microfabricated atomic clock physics packages including the connection between changes in the cell fabrication process and changes in the long-term frequency instability of the atomic clocks.
5.	The use of coherent population trapping in the implementation of compact atomic frequency references and the knowledge of optical pumping techniques in atomic physics.
The research group at the University of Notre Dame is uniquely qualified in this area as demonstrated by the collaborative research throughout the last two years.  The contract period is December 1, 2005 through November 30, 2006.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.

<SUBJECT>28 -- Aircraft Engine Warranty Services
<DESC>Description

Region 6 currently has four (4) Shorts C-23As used as smokejumper aircraft.  In 1998 the engines (PT-6A-45Rs) on these aircraft were overhauled and included a 10 year service life warranty (1998 through 2008).  The aircraft engine warranty is void if work is performed other than the original dealer or authorized representative of the dealer.  Costs associated with normal scheduled maintenance, such as hot section inspections is the responsibility of the operator.  It is our intent, in order to maintain the engine warranty, to sole source these services with the original dealer as of December 01, 2005.  Anticipated total annual costs for all aircraft will range from $0.00 to $150,000.00 per year.

Note that all questions and answers will be posted to http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/Contracts.html and that the Government is not liable for any expenses incurred by an attendee or eventual offero r in order to attend this conference.  Small Businesses should note the FAR 19 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and size standard is 541710/1000 employees.  This conference and resulting acquisition are not open to participation b y foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The contractor will be expected to provide for the enhancement, sustainment, and integration of the JIEDD-TF and the AWG in the analysis, assessment, operations and training for counter-IED and asy mmetric warfare operations throughout the world as well as the preparation of units scheduled for introduction as replacement forces into overseas theaters of operation.  Effort to be performed is in direct support of operational forces that are experienci ng frequent attacks by hostile forces using all forms of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).  Recently the Deputy Secretary of Defense ordered the JIEDD-TF, directed by a Flag Officer, to focus all available DOD resources to counter this threat.  Further,  the emerging AWG is being organized to accept the hand off portion of the JIEDD-TF mission.  In addition to supporting the formation of the AWG, the JIEDD-TF must continue all assigned missions and tasks without interruption in order to support the needs of deployed forces in support of the Global War on Terrorism.  Among ongoing tasks are the operational support of field teams in the CENTCOM Theater of Operations to thoroughly investigate IED attacks, embed and train with deployed forces and provide infor mation to the Director of the JIEDD-TF on behalf of the Army and CENTCOM.  In particular, the Director, JIEDD-TF and Commander, AWG will require high levels of expertise in the areas in counter insurgency (CI) and counter terrorism (CT).  Specifically, the  offeror must have extensive experience in advisement and support concerning Joint Special Operations, to include operational and developmental experience in the use of explosives and their initiation, and the tactics and techniques associated with the use  of explosives particularly as it relates to IED devices and all forms of asymmetric warfare. Asymmetric warfare (AW) is operations conducted by terrorists, guerillas, militias and paramilitaries to limit US military effectiveness while achieving political  objectives.  Moreover, experience must include individuals with extensive backgrounds and established reputations in the development, organization, preparation  and leadership of teams formed to respond in direct support of the vital interests of the Nation. Contracted effort requires that all contractors possess a minimum Security Clearance Classification of Secret, with some requirements for both Top Secret and  Top Secret-Special Compartmentalized Information (TS-SCI).  Specific to the JIEDD-TF, effort will consist of the following:  Advisement Team [see legal review] with established expertise in terrorist, guerilla and insurgent operations, experience with Joi nt Special Operations Forces and its relation to the development, formation, preparation and staffing of special teams in direct support of National level objectives.  This team will have experience synchronizing the transition of major projects and progra ms from short life-cycle management to long-term strategic efforts.  This team will have demonstrated experience in recruitment, assessment, selection, and training procedure development.  Strategic Communications/Public affairs experience in information d issemination to the Soldier, the public, industry and other Government organizations is also required.  Training Advisory Team will consist of certified explosive experts trained and qualified, at a minimum, to U.S. Army standards to advise and train units  at major unit installations and Combat Training Centers throughout the Continental United States (CONUS) and other countries or locations at the direction of the JIEDD-TF or AWG preparing them for combat operations and eventual deployment to any area of o peration (AOR).  This team will also include research analysts, and a Program Coordinator.  Field Investigative Teams will consist of multiple teams consisting of broadly gauged experts to perform the training of IED mitigation measures and counter IED tac tics, techniques and procedures to forces committed and forces preparing for entry into regions of hostility. The investigative teams could be directed to investigate IED incidents and technologies anywhere in the world.  Advisement, Training Advisory and Field Investigative Teams will also possess the proven skills, abilities and cognitive traits for operating in highly stressful environments of Counter-Insurgency and Counter-Terrorism threats.  These teams will show demonstrated abilities for adaptation t o meet mission requirements addressing undefined and evolving Asymmetric threats.  Specific to the AWG, effort will include in-depth and integrated analytic subject matter expertise and programmatic support to the following functional areas and missions. AWG Headquarters support will consist of liaison teams, which maintain the worldwide Joint Common Operational Picture, provide supply, maintenance and chemical/biological protection support and integration of materiel solutions.  Operations Squadron suppor t will consist of personnel available to deploy worldwide to observe, collect and disseminate emerging AW Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), provide AW training and assist in identifying and integrating AW countermeasure technologies.  Support to t he Training Advisory and Assessment Squadron will consist of analysis of intelligence, operational TTPs, training and materiel solution inter-relationships and the ability to articulate them in a strategy to combat asymmetric threats.  Support to the Conce pts Integration Squadron will consist of coordination of AW materiel requirements with the appropriate materiel command and the responsible acquisition executive as well as liaison with research and development and acquisition communities.  This acquisitio n will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level. Specific performance requirements will be set forth in the Task Orders (T/Os) issued under the contract.  The resultant contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/I ndefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awarded from a full and open competition.  The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arra ngements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams).  Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team m embership after award.  The resultant contract may contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful offeror from participating in any other JIEDD-TF or AWG contracts.

The Government’s objective for the High Speed Data Network/ Regulatory Administration Support System to be a complete system with all necessary equipment, hardware and software components, and associated work processes required to enable user required functionalities and management of the network.

Government’s objective is for the delivery of a network that is compliant to international standards, open and flexible to accommodate future user needs.

Government’s objective is for contractor to conduct site surveys for each NCMC location necessary for assessment and design.  Contractor’s SOW should include a plan that addresses site survey and assessment.  The Erbil and Al Basrah will be surveyed for VSAT installation only.

To get started follow the following steps:   

Step One: 
Upon contract award the contractor is required to provide the necessary logistical information needed by PCO Logistics. This information can be provided and updated as necessary by going to the PCO website (http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net) and logging in by selecting “Contractor/Vendor Log In” under the Logistic heading.  Initial log in will require the user to request a user name and password. Once the username and password is provided the user can identify and grant access to the other members or subcontractors.    Should there be any problems with this process contact the Logistics Movement Coordination Center (LMCC) Watch Officer directly at the following e-mail address:  pcolmcc@halliburton.com and the necessary assistance will be provided.  If the interim process is still in place the contractor will find four (4) forms listed and available under the logistics heading (Logistics Information Requirements Form, Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form, Cargo Plaques and Logistical Support Request).  Those forms should be individually completed and, with the exception of the cargo plaque, sent electronically to the above mentioned e-mail address for the LMCC.  The first form submitted will be the Logistics Information Requirements Form. The Logistics Information Requirements Form should be completed upon award of contract and updated as necessary.  All updates and changes to this form should be sent to the same e-mail address as the original form.  Additional contact information is available on the website mentioned above. Always reference the contract number.  

Step Two:
CPA 1-47  CUSTOMS LEVY EXEMPTION AND SHIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT AND CONTRACTING OFFICE (PCO) 

Effective 15 April 2004 Tariff Regulations pursuant to CPA Orders #54, as amended by Order #70 (Orders #54 and #70 are posted on the website), require commercial importations into Iraq to pay a 5% levy except for food, books, medicine, medical equipment, clothes and oil.   Additional exemptions include NGO’s, International Organizations, Reconstruction Projects under PCO, and single exempt donations.   Items shipped under this contract are exempt from this “Levy” provided a completed Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form is attached and included with each invoice and packing slip.  
 
The contractor is required to fill out the Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form and attach the duty free form to each shipment of goods under this contract that crosses the border into Iraq in order to qualify for the exemption.  The contractor must submit one copy of the completed duty free form and a copy of the first page of the primary contract, for customs verification, to the contracting officer and the PCO Logistics Office at pcocustoms@halliburton.com) 72 hours prior to the planned arrival date at the Iraq point of entry.


Step Three:
The items being acquired are for Iraqi Reconstruction and as per the “Packing and Marking Instructions” of this contract, and shall be Packaged and Marked accordingly.  Additionally, a Cargo Plaque is available from the website at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net under the logistics tab located at the top of the page.  There is a memorandum posted that explains how to complete the plaques.  There are three plaques, one is for shipments arriving into Baghdad International Airport, one is for shipments arriving into the Port of Umm Qasr, and the third one is for all other shipments.  The use of these plaques will ensure they are properly identified as PCO shipments and will reduce risk of loss or pilferage.  Each shipment must have a cargo plaque affixed to all sides of each container, pallet, or package.
 
The following is information is provided to assist with the completion of the cargo plaque
