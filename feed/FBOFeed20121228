Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 
The Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a Cost type, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Rockwell Collins, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  The contract will have a one-year ordering period with a six month option period.
  Orders will be placed against the contract on a sole-source basis with Rockwell Collins in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary software/information and expertise of Rockwell Collins, duplicative cost to the Government that it would not expect to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirement through any other source.  The effort is a continuation of phased developmental activities in the development of the United States Air Force (USAF) Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) Close Air Support System (CASS) software.
  Tasks include development, prototype, test, deployment and support of software releases that enhance the ability of TACPs to interface both with the ground forces they support and the aircraft conducting air operations, as well as with airspace Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) organizations.  

No formal solicitation will be issued.  All responsible sources may inquire into the specific terms and conditions; such inquiries will be considered by the agency.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
  Questions concerning this action may be directed to Ms. Lisa Sandy at telephone (812) 854-8792 or email lisa.a.sandy@navy.mil.  

Please reference solicitation number N00164-12-R-JS12 when responding to this notice.

<SOLNBR>SPMYM213R0008
<CONTACT>Jay Lewis (360) 476-0166
<DESC>DLA MARITIME - PUGET SOUND intends to issue a solicitation funded for the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) by the Navy’s Environmental Sustainability Development to Integration (NESDI) for the research and development of a surface ship structure ‘cold-cutting’ machine prototype. The machine will be used to cut away large sections of steel structure (hull) from decommissioned U.S. Naval ships for the purpose of recycling. Its primary purpose will be to efficiently and effectively remove large sections of hull while reducing the visible smoke opacity by limiting usage of existing oxy-fuel type cutting torches for this type of operation. The machine will be deployed aboard a ship by being mounted or supported by the ship structure itself and easily disassembled/reassembled.

The design of this cutting device and all supporting and powering components are open to any Industry and any ‘non-smoke/cold-cutting’ type device, configuration, technology and process provided the performance requirements contained in the solicitation and listed in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) are adequately met.
 

This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis using full and open competition under the Research and Development procedures outlined in FAR Part 35. This requirement will consider the most technically acceptable evaluation factors in determining the successful offeror. The applicable NAICS Code is 333517. The forthcoming solicitation number for this requirement will be provided in 15 days from the date of this synopsis in accordance with FAR 5.203(a) and listed under solicitation SPMYM2-13-R-0008. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for download on or shortly after 4 January 2013.
 
The solicitation document will provide instructions for an optional PSNS site visit in Bremerton, WA to tour the facility and understand the current ship dismantling process.
 The purpose of this site visit is to give interested parties and emerging market entrants a better perspective of how the prototype will be deployed and answer questions regarding technical specifications and evaluation requirements. It is anticipated that the date of this site will be on or near 18 January, 2013. 
   
The RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) web link at https://www.neco.navy.mil and will also be available for download at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Offerors wishing to submit an offer are responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFP from these websites and to frequently monitor the sites for any amendments to the RFP. A bidders list will not be maintained by this office, no telephone or fax requests for the RFP package will be accepted.
 Failure to respond to the electronically posted RFP and associated amendments prior to the date and time set for receipt of quotes may render vendor offer non-responsive and result in rejection of the same. Firms interested in submitting proposals must: (1) complete the pricing, (2) complete all representation and certifications found in the solicitation, (3) provide manufacturer information of proposed items, and (4) ensure current registration in the SAM system at htpps://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer
their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx".

<a href="mailto:kimberly.b.pumyea@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting contractors for maintenance dredging at Portsmouth Harbor and Piscataqua River in ME and NH.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The project is planned to be issued in on or about 20 August 2012.  The construction window for dredging activities is between December 1, 2012 and March 15, 2013.  The estimated construction cost is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a bid to be considered by the New England District.<br><br>The project involves maintenance dredging and advance maintenance dredging to remove a total of about 15,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel from the authorized 35 foot deep channel in the Piscataqua River. The work involves removal of 3 distinct, relatively small shoal areas within the Simplex Reach. Advance maintenance dredging to -40' Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 2' allowable over-depth dredging will be performed on the primary shoal located adjacent to the Tyco Integrated Systems Company wharf (i.e. formerly the Simplex Wire and Cable Co. dock). Maintenance dredging to -35' MLLW plus 2' of allowable over-depth (i.e. 37' below MLLW) will be performed on the other two shoals; one located upstream of the primary shoal and one located downstream of the primary shoal. The dredged material will be placed at a previously-used, in-river disposal area, located about 3,000' seaward of the dredging area. Because of the dynamic nature of the area, it is anticipated that it will be necessary for the contractor to dredge to the allowable depths (i.e. -42' and -37' respectively) to positively clear the required depths of<br>-40' and -35' below MLLW. The dredging window for this work is 1 Dec -15 Mar. Due to uncertain weather conditions and potential ice flows in the river, we are targeting the beginning of the dredging window to complete the work.<br><br>The Piscataqua River has one of the swiftest tidal currents of all of the commercial waterways in the U.S. Tidal currents can exceed 5 knots. Any dredging work is inherently dangerous, but it is especially critical when working during the winter months in relatively deep water, against swift tidal currents and around high vessel traffic that is involved in the transport of hazardous cargos in a densely populated area such as the international port of Portsmouth. The Contractor will be required to conduct the work in such a manner as to not obstruct navigation, and the contractor's plant will be required to be moved on the approach of any vessel to such an extent as may be necessary to afford a practicable passage.<br><br>The solicitation will be available on or about 20 August, 2012 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov). In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self register their firm with Federal Business Opportunities (go to http:/www.fbo.gov and register under Vendor/Citizen). Amendments, if any, to the solicitation will be made available at the http:/www/fbo.gov website. Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests will be accepted. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the FedBizOps Registration List.

In addition, the incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, which may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.

Similarly, must exercise judgment and discretion to the political, social and economic aspects of the Palestinian Authority Security Force Assistance program. <br />The Management Advisor will also provide advice and guidance to the INL/Amman office, which supports the PASF foreign assistance program activities at training locations in Jordan.</p>
<p>The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of demonstrated professional judgment, results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.</p>
<p>G. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The period of performance will be one year from the date of award with four option years.</p>

<p>A. BACKGROUND. The Office of Afghanistan and Pakistan Programs (INL/AP) is part of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in the U.S. Department of State. INL is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. INL/AP provides policy guidance and develops, executes, and monitors programs to address the full range of criminal justice issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. INL is engaged in an effort with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to build the capacity of the Afghan justice sector, specifically including its ability to try national security cases against former U.S. law of armed conflict detainees. Program activities include institutional capacity building; professionalizing justice sector personnel through legal education and training initiatives; fostering coordination within the criminal justice system especially between police, prosecutors, courts, and prisons; creating conditions in which Afghan Constitutional and international human rights guarantees can be upheld; increasing public awareness and access to justice; reporting to Embassy Kabul and INL/AP regarding Afghan prosecution and U.S. capacity-building efforts; and effectively promoting the rule of law.</p>
<p>B. PURPOSE. The Senior JCIP Justice Advisor works closely with INL program managers and specialists responsible for developing and implementing INL programs at the Justice Center in Parwan (JCIP). The Senior JCIP Justice Advisor will be under the leadership and direction of the INL Section's (INL/Kabul) Director and Deputy Director, reporting through the INL/Kabul's Senior Liaison to Combined Joint Interagency Task Force (CJIATF) 435 or other individual as designated by the INL/Kabul Director.</p>
<p>The Senior JCIP Justice Advisor will work with the INL section of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan and INL/AP to manage the day-to-day operations of INL's programs at the JCIP. The Senior JCIP Justice Advisor will also serve as a liaison with various U.S. Government agencies, GIRoA institutions, and international entities working on rule of law, focusing specifically on criminal justice and national security crimes.</p>
<p>The Senior JCIP Justice Advisor will assist in overseeing and managing INL efforts to mentor and advise GIRoA personnel at the JCIP. The Senior JCIP Justice Advisor will assist in overseeing any INL contract for justice advisor services at the JCIP.</p>
<p>The Senior JCIP Justice Advisor will provide technical expertise in a wide variety of settings, including internal U.S. embassy and multi-national meetings, and will assist GIRoA in reaching its stated goals in reforming its justice system. The Senior JCIP Justice Advisor will offer assistance in a variety of areas, including justice sector development; mentoring and training legal practitioners; legal education promotion; implementing anti-corruption initiatives; and combating major crimes, including national security crimes. He or she would also serve as a resource to the INL/Kabul Director, the Senior Liaison to CJIATF-435, the INL/Kabul Justice Program Manager, the Afghan leadership in government justice organizations, the Afghan leadership of civil society organizations, and the INL/AP Corrections Team Lead and Rule of Law Team Lead on justice issues. The Senior JCIP Justice Advisor is expected to draw on expertise from U.S. sources, as well as innovative justice projects from other countries that GIRoA might consider implementing.</p>
<p>C. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />This solicitation will be used to fill a single position in Parwan, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Senior JCIP Justice Advisor will work with INL/Kabul on all substantive and bureaucratic tasks relating to INL's legal operations work at the JCIP. This effort shall include:</p>
<p>&bull; Developing and maintaining a comprehensive knowledge of the Afghan legal system, with a particular focus on national security cases, criminal justice, human rights standards, and humanitarian law.</p>

<p>&bull; Overseeing U.S. efforts to facilitate fair, legitimate, and transparent trials of approximately 3,000 military detainees for their alleged violations of Afghan criminal law.</p>
<p>&bull; Providing subject-matter expertise to INL and Embassy Kabul on international justice system development and the Afghan criminal justice system, including on humanitarian law, international human rights standards, national security law, and international and domestic criminal law best practices.</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinating with INL/Kabul and INL/AP to conduct strategic planning in the justice sector, developing new initiatives, and reviewing programs for compliance with U.S. and Afghan law and for effectiveness in achieving the goals of GIRoA.</p>
<p>&bull; Serving as an advisory resource for INL/Kabul, INL/AP, the Coordinating Director of Rule of Law and Law Enforcement, CJIATF-435, and Afghan justice officials on specific aspects of planning and implementing justice reform programs in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; Assisting in overseeing, monitoring, coordinating, and assessing INL programs to ensure the fulfillment of program deliverables and foreign assistance priorities set by the Embassy.</p>
<p>&bull; Supporting the development and maintenance of relationships with members of the international community including other Coalition partners, non-governmental organizations, Afghan justice officials, the United Nations, and NATO.</p>
<p>&bull; Organizing and overseeing large-scale conferences to develop programs for implementing judicial sector assistance at the JCIP.</p>
<p>&bull; Participating in outreach activities with domestic and international rule of law communities to increase awareness of the JCIP as well as other INL programs and policies.</p>

<p>&bull; Overseeing the training, mentoring, and support of Afghan justice officials in developing sensitive and high-profile cases at the JCIP and reporting on these cases to INL/Kabul and INL/AP.</p>
<p>&bull; Mentoring GIRoA officials on improving government functioning and organizational reform targeted at building capacity.</p>

<p>&bull; Other duties as requested and assigned by the INL/Kabul Director and Senior Liaison to CJIATF-435, including supporting other INL projects.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of U.S. Government and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted legal principles and theories. In addition, the incumbent must be able to determine the application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between Department of State policies; legislation, including the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations relevant to INL; applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives; OMB Circulars; and Department of State financial operating procedures and policies. The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and interpretation of guidance on program- and project-planning and evaluation in a specialized area.</p>
<p>Complexity<br />The Senior JCIP Justice Advisor develops detailed plans and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program and develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military, and GIRoA can be complicated.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership, subject-matter expertise, complex innovation, strict adherence to high-level policy without lower-level interpretive assistance, and the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs, either single-handedly or with a variety of other stakeholders. These projects are broad in scope, and their technical, administrative, and political features further increase their complexity.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>Although in Afghanistan the work is principally sedentary, at the JCIP much time is spent outside, assisting with the administration of a busy court complex. There are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, on both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). The position also requires travel on helicopters or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty,windy, and polluted environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty or polluted environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.<br />D. POSITION ELEMENTS<br />Supervisory Controls: The incumbent reports to and receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the INL/Kabul Director and the Senior Liaison to CJIATF-435. The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational, project, and logistical operations.</p>
<p>The incumbent coordinates and communicates directly with the INL/Kabul Senior Liaison to CJIATF-435 and the INL/AP Corrections Teams. The incumbent's actions, decisions, and recommendations are reviewed on the results achieved and his or her conformity with appropriate laws and regulations. Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he or she must constantly depend on his or her professional judgment to further INL's mission.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a low-energy, low-angle argon ion mill.
<p><br />The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a low-energy, low-angle argon ion mill. This instrument will be used for final thinning of transmission electron microscopy specimens and for removal of the amorphous damage layer on FIB-prepared TEM specimens. The diversity of sample types encountered from the wide range of projects at NIST's CNST NanoFab demands a technically advanced and flexible argon ion mill. The mill must be capable of holding both 3-mm TEM specimen support grids and Omniprobe half grids. The energy must be variable, with a maximum energy of 2keV. Specimen cooling capabilities are required to reduce specimen heating. For cleanliness of the samples in the TEM, the argon ion mill must have an oil-free vacuum system. The ion mill must have imaging capabilities for placement of the beam on the specimen and for monitoring the final thickness of the specimen. Since the ion mill will be installed in a multi-user facility, ease of use and quick sample exchange and cooling/warming times are necessary.</p>
<p>The required low-energy, low-angle argon ion mill meets the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Argon gas source</p>
<p>2. Capable of holding both 3-mm TEM specimen support grids and Omniprobe half grids</p>
<p>3. Variable beam energy continuously adjustable from of 50eV up to a maximum of 2 keV</p>
<p>4. Variable milling angles of +/- 12 degrees</p>
<p>5. Oil-free vacuum system</p>
<p>6. Fast specimen exchange times<br /><br />7. Capable of liquid nitrogen cooling during milling</p>
<p>8. Redeposition of the milled material on the area of interest must be minimized</p>
<p>9. Imaging capability over the entire 3mm field of view, as well as magnified imaging to clearly monitor FIB prepared TEM specimens.</p>
<p><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the low-energy, low-angle argon ion mill, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that results would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies capable of providing a low-energy, low-angle argon ion mill are requested to email a detailed report describing their capabilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:<br /><br />1. Name of the company that provides the equipment for which specifications are provided.<br /><br />2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to provide the equipment, their address(es), and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).<br /><br />3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such equipment.<br /><br />4. Indication of whether the equipment for which specifications are provided is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).<br /><br />5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<a href="mailto:stacy.kirsch@navy.mil">stacy.kirsch@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>Synopsis:
The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) seeking information regarding the disassembly and radiological surveying of General Electric LM2500 Marine Gas Generators used aboard US Navy surface ships.  NAVSEA seeks to determine the industry capability, estimated costs, and steps required to complete the following:

-	Receive radiologically contaminated US Navy LM2500 Gas Generator Assets
-	Establish or possess a facility capable of processing LM2500 Gas Generator
-	Execute a complete disassembly of the asset in accordance with existing US Navy technical documents governing the depot overhaul of the LM2500 Gas Generator which will be provided.
-	Radiologically survey and disposition each part according to their level of radiological contamination as either above or below the permissible limits as defined the American National Standard Institute Standard (ANSI) 13.12 and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Regulatory Guide 1.86 (less than 1000dpm per 100 square cm loose or removable contaminants and less than 6000dpm per 100 square cm total).
-	Package uncontaminated parts for shipment to a USN designated repair facility for further processing.
-	Package contaminated parts for commercial transport and disposal.
-	Dispose of any radiologically contaminated by-products resultant from the disassembly and survey of the LM2500 Gas Generator.

Follow-on efforts will be dependent upon the result of the first asset processed.

Description:
As a result of operation in radiologically contaminated areas, the US Navy currently has forty-five (45) LM2500 Marine Gas Turbines with Gas Generators operating under radiological controls.
  Due to the nature of the contamination, no US Navy facility is currently available to process the affected engines either for decontamination or repair following a failure.  The LM2500 is the main propulsion unit for the CG-47 class cruiser, the DDG-51 class destroyer, and the LCS-2 variant class ship as well as the main propulsion unit for several ships under the Military Sealift Command (MSC).  Without a US Navy facility to repair the affected engines, each one must be disposed of as hazardous waste requiring replacement with new assets.  The US Navy is seeking to leverage capabilities in commercial industry to determine if either decontamination or repair of these assets is a less costly option compared with new procurement.
  

The Navy anticipates that, should decontamination/repair of radiologically controlled assets prove economically beneficial, a total throughput of forty-five (45) LM2500 assets will be processed.  All assets would be delivered in US Navy shipping containers.  These containers would have to be opened in a radiologically controlled environment and all items inside the container as well as the interior of the container itself subject to radiological controls.  All handling and required tooling would similarly be under radiological controls for the duration of work and would require decontamination before a return to regular stock or special disposal if decontamination is not possible.

Processing of radiologically controlled items may generate radiological waste products (metal shavings, waste water, etc.) which would also be classified as radiologically contaminated and would require either special packaging or decontamination prior to disposal.
  Handling and disposal of waste products would be the responsibility of the contractor.


Repair and overhaul work of radiologically contaminated assets requires a separate working area that meets national and state requirements for the handling of such assets.  NAVSEA requests that respondents indicate whether or not they currently posses a facility or would need to construct a facility for this effort.

Compliance to Standards:  
The ANSI 13.12 and NRC Regulatory Guide 1.86 are existing standards that support this effort.  Respondents will need to obtain an agreement state license or NRC state license prior to accepting any US Navy radiologically controlled assets.  Disassembly procedures for the LM2500 Marine Gas Generator are marked DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D (Distribution authorized to Department of Defense (DOD) and DOD contractors only; Critical Technology).
  A technical data package can be provided upon request and upon verification that the requestor is a bona fide US Department of Defense (DOD) contractor familiar with the procedures to handle technical data package materials that may include limited distribution information.  Evidence in the form of a fully signed and approved DD Form 2345 (MILITARY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT) will be required prior to receipt of the technical data package.  Please request the technical data package via email to the following address: mark.e.burns@navy.mil.  

Responses:
NAVSEA is seeking industry’s feedback and commentary on the scope, schedule and rough order of magnitude (ROM) costs associated with disassembling and radiologically assessing a single LM2500 Gas Generator as well as rough order of magnitude costs associated with radiologically assessing follow-on LM2500 Gas Generator assets by September 30, 2013.

The Navy is also interested in responses to the following questions:

1.	Disassembly of the LM2500 Gas Generator requires special tooling to complete a full disassembly.
  NAVSEA requests that respondents indicate whether or not they currently posses the required tooling, have a means to procure the tooling, or would require the tooling be provided as Government Furnished Material.  If respondents posses partial tooling, NAVSEA requests a listing or ROM to procure what additional tooling would be required.
2.	Identify an existing or develop a ROM estimate for the construction of a facility capable of isolating and disassembling the LM2500 Marine Gas Turbine Engine (MGTE), all associated tooling and equipment, and personnel to maintain radiological controls at all times until all contaminated items are officially cleared by the US Navy for release.
3.	Provide a ROM cost for the recurring engineering costs to continue to process LM2500 radiologically controlled assets.
4.	For respondents that need to construct a facility, provide an estimated timeline for construction and state certification of the facility.
5.	For respondents that will contract out radiological inspections, provide a ROM for sub-contracted costs and identification of intended performers.
6.	NAVSEA requests a notional timeline for the following where applicable:
a.	Construction and certification of a radiologically controlled facility
b.	Subcontract award for radiological assessments
c.	Procurement of required tooling
d.	Disassembly of an LM2500 Gas Generator asset
e.	Radiological assessment of LM2500 Gas Generator disassembled components
f.	Cleaning/decontamination of the LM2500 Gas Generator components
g.	Packaging of uncontaminated/decontaminated parts for shipment
h.	Packaging of contaminated parts for shipment

Responses and comments are requested by 4:00 pm (EST), on February 4, 2013.
  However, submissions will be accepted after this date, but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEA’s strategic planning.  Responses should indicate enough detail so that potential Navy interest can be assessed.  Responses are requested to be provided electronically and acceptable formats include Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint files.  All inquiries and comment submissions should be emailed to mark.e.burns@navy.mil.  The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies and should not contain proprietary information.  However, if some of the background on the comments provided is considered proprietary to the respondent, that portion shall be segregated and labeled as such and will be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.
  

This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies.  The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing future strategies for the handling of radiologically contaminated LM2500 Gas Generator assets.  Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  This RFI is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. NAVSEA may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.
  No written responses will be returned.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - <br />THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. <br />This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) only. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Transatlantic Division, Middle East District (TAM) is seeking preliminary marketing information from capable and reliable sources. TAM is contemplating the award of one or more contract actions for the acquisition of Technical English Language Training for foreign students.</p>
<p>Based upon international agreements, TAM provides friendly Foreign and Allied Governments with facilities and infrastructure support. As part of our support to Host Nations (HNs), TAM trains HN government employees (military and civilian) in how the Corps performs its missions, and assists in the individual's professional training in technical fields. To further this learning experience and enhance the support provided by TAM, some HNs have asked if TAM could support HN employees with Technical English Language Training.</p>
<p>TAM defines Technical English Language Training as advanced training in the English language specifically focused on the areas of engineering, architecture, design, construction, technical report writing, and facility operations and maintenance. Selected students would already have a basic skill in conversational and written English (as a second language), and would generally have a non-US college degree in a technical area, but they would not likely be totally familiar and comfortable with English technical terms from the areas listed above. TAM desires that any traditional classroom training be augmented with "immersion" type training, whereby students are immersed in technical English for considerable periods of time, are frequently tested for accuracy and competency, and have practical exercises in such tasks as reading blueprints/drawings, creating technical reports from raw data, performing design reviews and write-up, and similar situations. Students could also be expected to be trained to be competent and comfortable with terminology regarding computer aided drafting and design (CADD), databases, spreadsheets, design/construction scheduling software, design and construction contracts, and similar areas. TAM also desires that applicable students be scheduled for some time with a US Architect-Engineer or Construction firm affiliated with the service provider to augment the training with real-world situations.</p>
<p>TAM is currently looking at a program in the neighborhood of 24 weeks in duration, but TAM prefers to utilize an existing program of similar nature rather than a special program specifically designed for this requirement. It is intended that this training would take place within the CENTCOM AOR</p>

<DESC>Health Care Claims Preferred Pricing Market Research Request For Information (RFI)

PURPOSE:
The purpose of this RFI is to assist the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) in meeting its economic objective of providing high quality, accessible health care services to the nation's military veteran's at the most reasonable prices obtainable.  When eligible veterans receive health care services from private sector providers, this contract allows the VA, through VA Medical Centers (VAMC) to share in the savings available through the contractor's discount agreements with institutional and individual providers.  The preferred pricing services provided are applicable to health care claims generated under the VA's Non-VA Care (Fee Basis) program. This scope is identified below.

BACKGROUND:
VA intends to utilize the services of a preferred pricing contractor to identify cost savings on all types of health care claims by using the discounted rates of the contractor's network providers. The contractor must be URAC (Utilization Review Accreditation Commission) certified and/or NCQA (National Committee for Quality Assurance) certified. Also, the contractor operation must be in compliance with the Privacy Act and HIPAA Privacy Rule.	

OBJECTIVES: 
The purpose of market research is to allow Government the opportunity for dialogue and interaction with industry in order to:
"	Seek new ideas and approaches;
"	Get a more complete understanding of what the market has to offer;
"	Initiate dialogue with subject matter experts; and
"	Improve understanding of best practices and lessons learned.

The primary goal for this information gathering effort is to better understand the offerings for claims preferred pricing through the contractor's network providers. The preferred pricing savings should exceed rates normally paid using Medicare's (CMS) Prospective Payments Schedules (PPS).
RESPONSE
All interested parties are requested to provide the following information: Company name, address, point of contact information, size and business status (small, large, veteran owned etc.), location, DUNS number, GSA Schedule information, if applicable; and a description of the firm's capabilities with respect to the requirements described. Respondents are requested to provide information via email to the contracting officer Janice.Bertapelle-Anderson@va.gov no later than 4:30 PM January 23, 2013, local Denver, Colorado time (MDT).

DISCLAIMER
This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

NOTE:  We cannot discuss the prospect of any future VA requirements, and providing responses to this questionnaire in no way provides your firm with any advantage or disadvantage toward a potential VA solicitation. The information collected by VA for the purpose of this effort will not be distributed or utilized for any other use or intent.

PREFERRED PRICING SCOPE:
The preferred pricing services scope, provided under this request, entails health care claims generated under the VA's Non-VA Care (Fee Basis) program. VA intends to work with the preferred pricing contractor to develop a process whereby outpatient, non-contracted health care claims will be electronically referred to the contractor. The types of health care claims will be determined upon contract award as the contractor will work with the VA to determine that the claims sent to them are appropriate for preferred pricing. The contractor shall review each claim to determine whether the provider is part of the contractor's network of providers and shall return to VA the lower contracted allowable amount for the services rendered.  If the provider is not part of the contractor's network of providers, the contractor shall return the claim to VA with no cost savings indicated.   VAMCs will submit Non-VA health care claims meeting specific criteria to the contractor for preferred pricing at the contractor's expense.  The contractor identifies savings for Non-VA health care claims by applying its discounted network provider prices.

Claims will be sent to the contractor for preferred pricing with the exception of:

"	Claims where the VA allowable is less than $10.00.  This is the national standard threshold.  VAMCs are allowed to send claims for less than $10.00 for 30 days after the first claim is sent to the contractor, and review the savings to determine if a lower threshold would be appropriate.  The new threshold would be valid for a period of 1 year and would be re-evaluated at that time.

"	Claims paid under the Millennium Bill authority (Title 38 USC 1725)

"	Claims paid under a contractual agreement (to include Memorandums of Understanding and Sharing Agreements)

"	Claims for providers not included in the contractor's network.

"	Claims from stations without a current fiscal year purchase order.

"	Claims with an approved waiver.

Jacobs Technology is the only source able to continue the services while the recompete is being executed.

<DESC>To be the Government's leader in acquisition services, GSA sets the highest standards for its acquisition programs. Over the last 24 months, GSA has evaluated the effectiveness of the Schedule 75 Multiple Awards Schedules (MAS) Program. After review and careful consideration, it has been determined Schedule 75 will remain closed to new offers for an additional 12 months. The Schedule will re-open effective October 1, 2013 and new offers will be accepted at that time.

GSA still recognizes the important role of our schedule holders who have long supported the MAS program. Since holding a schedule contract is a very expensive proposition for the schedule holder and GSA, we are reallocating our resources to better serve our customer base. Current Schedule 75 contract holders with available options that are successfully performing will continue to be exercised. Additionally, modification requests to existing contracts will still be honored.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING PROCURED UTILIZING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.<br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

(b)  Only those Quoting Contractors which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii).

<p>CONTRACT SPECIALIST NAME &amp; PHONE NUMBER: TEDRA N. THOMPSON, 904 232-2016</p>
<p><br />THIS NOTICE IS POSTED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY: THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING CONTRACTORS AWARDED A CONTRACT UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER</p>
<p>W912EP-10-R-0023 &amp; W912EP-12-R-0011: Great Lakes Dredge and Dock, LLC (W912EP-11-D-0004); Weeks Marine, Inc. (W912EP-11-D-0005); Manson Construction Company (W912EP-11-D-0006); Dutra Dredging Company (W912EP-11-D-0007) and Cashman Dredging and Marine Contracting (W912EP-12-D-0003)</p>
<p><br />PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FROM ANY ENTITY OTHER THAN THE PREVIOUSLY LISTED FIRMS INCLUDED IN THE GROUP1 MATOC POOL.</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The proposed project is to construct beach nourishment along 4 miles of the Atlantic Ocean shoreline commencing south from the northern boundary of Martin County between the FDEP reference monuments R-1 through R-25. The approved historical beach fill template included a 9O-foot wide berm at Elevation +6.5 NAVD 88. The constructed foreshore slope would be 1:10. At the south of the project, the beach tapers to the existing profile at monument R-25. The beach fill design also includes a 65-foot wide dune feature that has a 20-foot wide crest at Elevation +11.0 NAVD 88.</p>
<p>For this project, the Contractor shall construct alternate equal-length segments of shoreline using the historical template mentioned above with an experimental construction template. The experimental or turtle-friendly template would begin at the design toe of the dune at Elevation +6.5 NAVD 88. The design beach profile would slope at 1 on 50 to Elevation +5.5 NAVD 88 (50-foot wide). From this point, the turtle-friendly profile shall slope at 1 on 20 to mean low water (Elevation +2.6 NAVD 88). This experimental segment of fill shall also include the dune feature as specified above. The distance from R-1 to R-25 is approximately 21,600 feet. Each 2000-foot segment shall be separated by a 700-foot transition. The north limit of the project shall transition into the existing beach profile at R-1 with a 200-foot taper.</p>
<p>Magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.<br />To fill this project will require a hopper dredge or similar equipment to obtain beach quality sand that will come from a borrow site located approximately 6 nautical miles offshore of the northern portion of the project. Designated pipeline corridors shall be used by the Contractor for access to the beach. This will minimize impact on the marine habitat offshore. The request for proposal will be issued on 10 OCTOBER 2012 and proposals will be due on or about 09 NOVEMBER 2012. The award of the task order will be made on the basis of Lowest Price Technical Acceptable (LPTA). For LPTA, the technical evaluation factors are availability of technically acceptable plant and equipment and past performance. Districts can contact the Jacksonville District regarding contractors' performance under the MATOC and/or check contractors' past performance on PPIRS (CCASS). See attached request for proposal for submission requirements.</p>
<p>The request for proposal will be issued in electronic format only and will be posted on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/. In order to receive notification of any amendments, firms must REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. If you are not registered, the Government is not responsible with providing you with notification of any changes to this solicitation. NAICS Code 237990, size standard $20 million.</p>

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- <br />(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; <br />(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- <br />(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or <br />(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and <br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. <br />Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs <br />(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. <br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: <br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or <br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). <br />(2) Plan deemed in certain cases.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  <br>    <br>  	HQ Army Materiel Command	  <br>  	Office of Command Counsel  <br>  	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401  <br>  	Ft.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within twenty (20) working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.   <br>      <br>   	HQ Army Materiel Command	   <br>   	Office of Command Counsel   <br>   	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401   <br>   	Ft.

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?

Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction applies only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>C. GUIDELINES<br />Guidelines consist of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Department of State Acquisition Regulations, the CO's letter of delegation of authority appointing the COR, the terms and conditions of the CIVPOL contract, and official INL bureau guidelines. In addition, the incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, which may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, the Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH), the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.</p>
<p>D. COMPLEXITY<br />The programs supported by CIVPOL contracts are generally highly complex multi-year development and capacity-building programs. The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.</p>
<p>Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.</p>
<p>E. PHYSICAL DEMANDS<br />The work requires the ability to travel to and from the West Bank and Jordan. Successful completion of a State Department Class 1 unrestricted medical exam is required. Visits to construction program and training sites will be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Work is often done in hot, dusty, and windy environments, when visiting outdoor sites. Those with difficulties adapting to dusty environments will find this aspect of the work difficult and may not be capable of passing the State Department required medical exam.</p>
<p>F. SUPERVISORY CONTROLS<br />The incumbent reports to the INL Director. The incumbent must exercise a significant degree of judgment with regard to interaction with other sections within the Consulate. Similarly, must exercise judgment and discretion to the political, social and economic aspects of the Palestinian Authority Security Force Assistance program. <br />The Management Advisor will also provide advice and guidance to the INL/Amman office, which supports the PASF foreign assistance program activities at training locations in Jordan.</p>
<p>The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of demonstrated professional judgment, results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.</p>

<DESC>-THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. PLEASE DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS POSTING-<br /><br />This modification was awarded to Edaptive Systems LLC. the current holder of the Program Management and Business Requirements (PMBR) contract.&nbsp;The purpose of the modification is&nbsp;for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to modify the PMBR contract to continue to support the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) requirement for Hospital Value Based Purchasing (HVBP) and Physicians Quality Reporting Systems (PQRS).<br /><br />The base contract was competitively awarded in June 2009.&nbsp; This requirement was not competed and is added to the contract as a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Action.&nbsp; The work could not be competed as Firm-Fixed-Price because it was determined that the nature of the work is unpredictable and therefore, price/cost could not be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty.&nbsp; This requirement aligned within the scope of the current PMBR contract and modifying the contract is the most cost effective for the Government.

<DESC>This is a synopsis of repair purchase order N00383-13-M-034D with Honeywell International Inc (02LU7). The unit covered under this repair order is FAN VANEAXIAL, NSN: 7RE 4140-01-329-3428, P/N: 52E15-1.

The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.
 This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The proposed project is to construct beach nourishment along 4 miles of the <br> Atlantic Ocean shoreline commencing south from the northern boundary of <br> Martin County between the FDEP reference monuments R-1 through R-25. The <br> approved historical beach fill template included a 9O-foot wide berm at <br> Elevation +6.5 NAVD 88. The constructed foreshore slope would be 1:10. At <br> the south of the project, the beach tapers to the existing profile at <br> monument R-25. The beach fill design also includes a 65-foot wide dune <br> feature that has a 20-foot wide crest at Elevation +11.0 NAVD 88. <br>  <br> For this project, the Contractor shall construct alternate equal-length <br> segments of shoreline using the historical template mentioned above with an <br> experimental construction template. The experimental or turtle-friendly <br> template would begin at the design toe of the dune at Elevation +6.5 NAVD <br> 88. The design beach profile would slope at 1 on 50 to Elevation +5.5 NAVD <br> 88 (50-foot wide). From this point, the turtle-friendly profile shall slope <br> at 1 on 20 to mean low water (Elevation +2.6 NAVD 88). This experimental <br> segment of fill shall also include the dune feature as specified above. The <br> distance from R-1 to R-25 is approximately 21,600 feet. Each 2000-foot <br> segment shall be separated by a 700-foot transition. The north limit of the <br> project shall transition into the existing beach profile at R-1 with a <br> 200-foot taper. <br>
