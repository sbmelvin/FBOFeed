ITEMS TO BE INCLUDED ON THIS SOLICITATION ARE AS FOLLOWS: CLIN NIIN NAME PN CLIN1 015191177 Cable Assy, Radi B969 CLIN2 015191213 Headset,Electrical B935 CLIN3015961031 SSD,32GB,SATA,w/CARB1490 CLIN4 015961033HDD,600 GB,SAS,w/CARB1576 CLIN5 016231368 Circuit Card Assy B1491 Lockheed Martin is the design agent, system integrator and the NAVSEA approved source of supply and certified depot for the AN/UYQ-70(V) weapon system. NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator. The integrator has the necessary operational, design, configuration management, integration and engineering knowledge when purchasing, building and repairing Q-70 parts for hosted systems. ***SOURCE APPROVAL*** LOCKHEED MARTIN IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY FOR THESE ITEMS. LOCKHEED MARTIN IS THE DESIGN AGENT, SYSTEM INTEGRATOR AND THE NAVSEA APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND CERTIFIED DEPOT FOR THE AN/UYQ-70(V) WEAPON SYSTEM.

Justification:

These Toshiba medical imaging systems are proprietary to Toshiba medical systems. Diagnostic imaging studies are performed using these Toshiba systems on a routine and emergency basis. The CT system is used to perform emergency cardiac and neurological scans (640 slice-count) to determine course of patient treatment. In certain cases, the patient s life may literally be in jeopardy. There are no other systems at Overton Brooks with equal diagnostic capabilities. Prolonged downtime of these Toshiba systems could result in prolonged suffering of our patients, and/or costly outsourcing of diagnostic studies to other facilities. 

Toshiba is the only company with a VPN remote connectivity capability (subject to VA approval), which is essential to system uptimes. Additionally, Toshiba is the only company that can provide manufacturer s updates to software, hardware and firmware to address FDA recalls and for better functionality of the systems. Toshiba has exclusive rights to these required updates, and does not provide them to competitors, nor authorize competitors to have remote access to a Toshiba system. This is unequivocally a sole-source requirement!

(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(b) Inclue the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.

“Registered in the SAM database” means that—

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 

  (2)  The Contractor’s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 

  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record “Active”. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.<BR><BR>“System for Award Management (SAM)” means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.  It includes—

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.

(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number—

    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or

    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.


  (2)  The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information:

(d)  Reserved.

(e)  Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering.  Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.<BR><BR>(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to—

      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; 

      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and

      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 

    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.
