Universities are reminded that costs for research projects conducted on behalf of the U.S. government are governed exclusively by OMB Circular A-21.  The estimated project costs must be broken down for each year of the program to show the following:  (1) A list of participants, not necessarily by name, showing the time and number of direct productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research associates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project.  For proposals from universities, the time and amounts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort.  (2) An itemized list of permanent equipment showing the cost of each item.  Permanent equipment is any article of non-expendable tangible personal property having a useful life of more than two years, and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit.  (3) A general description and total estimated cost of expendable equipment and supplies.  (4) Contemplated expenditures for travel with brief explanation.  Travel budgets that exceed $1,500 per principal investigator per year or that include foreign travel or travel by other than principal investigators will require special investigation.  (5) Other direct costs.  (6) Cost for consulting services, if any, showing number of days, daily rates, and estimated travel/per diem costs.  The need for consulting services must be fully justified.  (7) Indirect costs indicating whether rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g., a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the rate becomes provisional).  (8) The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project.  (9) Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and documented (written quotes, engineering estimates, etc).  Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy.  Pursuant to FAR 19.708, all formal proposals over $550K that are not submitted by a small business concern will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan with their formal proposal. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the technical monitor determines them to be necessary.  Proposals will be considered having a base duration of one year, with up to four additional consecutive one-year periods.  The total resulting contract value (of each individual contract) cannot exceed $75 million dollars and the total period of performance cannot exceed 5 years or 60 months.  This time period limitation includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of any final reports.  Any Awards under this BAA will be made to offerors on the basis of the evaluation criteria stated above.  Proposals identified for negotiation may result in a contract or other transaction agreement depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  The Government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.  It is anticipated that the majority of any resulting contract awards that may result from this BAA will be in the form of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) completion and/or level of effort contracts; however, other types of awards may be made against this announcement, if deemed appropriate.  Any formal proposal selection is subject to fiscal law and statutory restrictions governing the availability of government funds.  Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit and not against other proposals submitted under this announcement.  All concept papers received will be evaluated by a peer review.  The evaluation of concept papers will be based on overall scientific and technical merit, effectiveness of the work plan, relevant experience and expertise, the relevance to AMRDEC mission and program goals, cost reasonableness, and funds availability. The overall scientific and technical merit is significantly more important than relevant experience and expertise and relevance to AMRDEC mission and program goals followed by effectiveness of the work plan and cost reasonableness.  The Government anticipates the possibility of multiple awards under this Broad Agency Announcement, although no minimum or maximum number of awards is guaranteed.  The amount of resources available and number of awards under this BAA for five years of activity will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds in the out-years.  THE GOVERNMENT EXPRESSLY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE FORMAL RESPONSES RECEIVED.  Participants are requested to submit proposals containing information in either the unclassified or classified category, up to the Secret level.  The contractor will be required to receive and store information at a classification level matching his submittal, which must fall within the categories of unclassified or classified up to the Secret level.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals as well as 35.016, which authorizes the use of BAAs for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement.  In addition, FAR 35.016 allows BAAs to be used by agencies to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  Any resulting Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  This BAA shall remain in effect for a period of five years from date of synopsis. <BR> <BR>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a concept paper which shall be considered by the agency.  Concept papers must be submitted electronically to REDS.NEC.BroadAgency@us.army.mil.  All concept papers should include contact information along with your cage code, Taxpayer Identification number, and DUNS number.  For further information regarding this solicitation, contact Lisa Duncan via email at Lisa.D.Duncan@us.army.mil. <BR>

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Onida, SD that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 2887 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2750 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years (5 year initial term + 5 year renewal option). The space must be available for occupancy on or before 5/1/2011. The delineated area is bounded or affronted on the

North - 	180th St; 302nd Ave/182nd St
South - 	188th St

West  	301st Ave

Other applicable requirements include:

 24 paved surface parking spaces including 4 for official vehicles
 Specific Information Technology requirements

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, capable of providing Technical Support Services to the FAA.

The FAA Flight Plan and other performance plans require the FAA to safely incorporate new aircraft into the NAS, evaluate current aircraft wake categories, and establish an acceptable wake encounter standard.  The current Aircraft Vortex Spacing System Predictor Algorithm (APA) model that predicts the evolution of vortices from aircraft needs improvement to fulfill the FAA's responsibility for safety and capacity.  The improved model will be used to help set the wake separation standards for new aircraft and will be used to help evaluate proposed, new operational procedures.

Due to the unique knowledge and support material required, Quarterwave Corp is the only contractor to provide this product.  This item is necessary to support the AN/UPQ-8 threat emitter during its lifecycle. 
This will be a commercial acquisition using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  The North American Classification System (NAICS) codes 334220.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposal received by May 14 2010 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A proposal may be submitted via e-mail or facsimile with complete mailing address, point of contact, phone number, facsimile number, business size and shall be clearly marked with solicitation N00244-10-T-0229.  Please forward your information not later than 4:00 PM PST May 14 2010 to Rachel.McFarland@navy.mil or by facsimile (562-626-7877).  Quotes submitted as an attachment to an email should be sent in Word Version 6.0 or higher.  

Sole Source Justification:  
1.  The intended use of the material or service:  
This procurement is to acquire a traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA), Model 9100/96208-H68110, a component of an AN/UPQ-8 Threat Emitter used to train tactical aircraft aviators in hostile surface-to-air environments for the the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point.     

2.  The critical or unique characteristics of the material or service are mandatory for the intended use:
The end item, the An/UPQ-8 threat Emitter, is designed around the TWTA Model 9100/96208-H68110.   The "heart" of this threat emitter is its traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) and Quarterwave Corporation is the sole designer and manufacturer of this TWTA with proprietary rights to the proposed item' technical data package.  As the original manufacturer, Quarterwave Corp, can manufacture the requested TWTA based on its inherent knowledge on its design.  

3.  Reason why only the select source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of all other sources:  
No other contractor can provide this item.  Quarterwave Corporation Source owns proprietary rights and data to required equipment.  The required part must meet the form, fit, and function compatibility requirements of the original AN/UPQ-8 TWTA threat emitter.   
4.  Market Survey Conducted:  
No market survey was conducted.  Quarterwave Corporation part numbers are peculiar to their line of products.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services at the U.S. Mission Monrovia.  The U.S. Mission Monrovia requires a secure environment to conduct their mission.  The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement.  The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.  Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).

All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. 

The Government plans to post the solicitation in this site on or about May 20, 2010.  No paper copies will be mailed.  The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows:  The synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days.  Once the solicitation announcement closes on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals.  All dates are subject to change.  Offerors will be notified.
A site visit is tentatively scheduled approximately twenty-one (21) days after the solicitation opens, at the U.S. Mission Monrovia.  A firm date will be announced at the time the solicitation is posted.  Offerors are responsible for entry visa, all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in Monrovia.  Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the site visit.

Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Matthew J. Colantonio at ColantonioMJ@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 



In accordance with 22 U.S.C.  4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.

<DESC>CLDP CONFERENCE SYNOPSIS
<p><br />The U.S. Department of Commerce plans to award a small business set-aside Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract to up to three (3) responsible U.S. small businesses to perform international logistics support services worldwide (to include austere and conflict areas). Task orders awarded under this contract will contain a combination of firm fixed priced and cost reimbursable line items. Of the up to three (3) contracts, the U.S. Department of Commerce plans to award (and reserves the right to award) up to two (2) to responsible small business Hub Zone concerns providing they provide the Government with technically acceptable proposals at fair and reasonable prices. The NAICS code for these services is 561920 Convention and Trade Show Organizers.</p>
<p>The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) is a U.S. Department of Commerce initiative funded in part by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department of State to help achieve U.S. foreign policy goals. CLDP usually provides technical assistance to designated countries by sponsoring technical skill training workshops, conferences, consultative tour visits, and short term law based programs domestically and overseas to include austere regions and warzones. In order to carry out their mission, CLDP relies on the logistical capabilities of contractors to setup, coordinate, organize, and handle all the administrative events related tasks that go into putting on conferences, workshops, training seminars, programs, etc. for the CLDP at locations worldwide. <br /><br />As a minimum to propose on this requirement, responsible U.S. small businesses shall have a minimum five (5) years experience setting up, coordinating, planning and/or organizing conferences, workshops, training seminars or programs.

U.S. small businesses shall also have (and be able to provide proof in the form of income statements or balance sheets and/or letter of credit from financial institutions, etc.) the financial resources to provide logistical support to the Government upfront (i.e. for travel tickets, passports, visa fees, hotel rooms for non-government employees and conference attendees for the duration of the conference, per diem allowances for non-government employees, and conference attendees for the duration of the conference, and ground transportation, rental and leasing fees, printing fees, etc.) before being reimbursed in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act. These reimbursable costs could reach up to $500,000.00 per project on multiple projects awarded to the vendor.</p>
<p>Responsible U.S. small businesses meeting the minimum requirements who are planning on proposing for this requirement shall be required to list ALL (AND NOT SOME) contracts and subcontracts they have held over the past five years for the same or similar work. Responsible U.S. small businesses shall be required to provide the following information for EACH (AND NOT SOME) contract and subcontract:</p>
<p>1. Customer's name, address, and current telephone numbers of customer's lead contract and technical personnel;<br />2. Contract number and type;<br />3. Date of the contract, place(s) of performance, and delivery dates or period of performance;<br />4. Contract size (number of personnel employed by contract per labor category) and dollar value;<br />5. Brief description of the work, including responsibilities;<br />6. Description of the comparability of the work to the work required under this solicitation;<br />7. Brief discussion of any technical problems and their resolutions; <br />8. Brief discussion of any terminations (partial or complete) and the type (convenience or default) as well as any deficiencies notices, show cause notices or cure notices (provide explanatory details); and<br />9.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">ART IN ARCHITECTURE PROJECT</p>
</span></strong>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the modernization of the Margaret Chase Smith Federal Building in Bangor, Maine. Margaret Chase Smith was a U.S. Representative and Senator for Maine from 1940 to 1973.&#12288; She was the first woman to be nominated for the presidency at a major party convention.&#12288; The building was named for Smith in 1984.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">GSA will modernize the federal building to meet the needs of its various tenants: U.S. Courts, U.S. Senate offices, Social Security Administration, and several other agencies. This modernization project is a pivotal undertaking in extending the life of the building. It will include the design and construction of a new, central entrance pavilion and landscaped plaza, as well as the replacement or upgrade of outdated mechanical and electrical systems. With the completion of the modernization project, the building will apply for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) gold certification.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;GSA allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs of new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions. The art budget for the Margaret Chase Smith Federal Building project is currently estimated to be $150,000. One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artists Registry (Registry). The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions. Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture"><span>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</span></a></p>
<span>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the Margaret Chase Smith Federal Building in Bangor, Maine, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 3:00 PM Eastern Time on June 4, 2010. Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for the Bangor project, but will be considered for future GSA commissions alongside all other artists on the Registry. Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis. Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a statement that he or she can perform the work associated with the GSA commission within the identified budget. GSA will count the combined weight of all the selection criteria as significantly more important than price.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;This Art in Architecture opportunity is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and is subject to ARRA reporting requirements.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The GSA Heating &amp; Operation Transmission District (HOTD) steam system is located in the downtown area of Washington, DC. The proposed project consists of the replacement of old and deteriorated underground main steam and condensate lines in the system that are the direct buried main steam and condensate return service lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It also includes other site work such as shoring, restoration of sidewalks, curbs and pavement, temporary lighting and temporary traffic controls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Replacing these lines will improve steam service reliability, and prevent future line ruptures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will also substantially improve overall system efficiency through better-insulated lines, and increased condensate return to the heating plant. This project follows a FY 2006 prospectus project (HOTD Upgrade I), which consisted of the replacement of individual building steam service and condensate return lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The first project, HOTD Upgrade I is replacing buried steam &amp; condensate service lines that run between the main lines and individual Steam Service Customer buildings.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The majority of the HOTD Upgrade II work will be performed underground; the total estimated project cost ranges between $20M and $30M, which includes an unforeseen site conditions/design contingency to compensate for the inevitable risks associated with underground utility work.

<DESC>COMBINED PRESOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT AND ADVISORY MULTI-STEP NOTIFICATION FOR IDENTITY INTELLIGENCE (I2) BIOMETRICS SERVICES<BR><BR> 1.0	Description<BR>This publication serves as a combined pre-solicitation announcement and Advisory Multi-Step (AMS) notification by the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM).  INSCOM intends to issue a solicitation on behalf of the INSCOM G3 Biometrics Division.  This requirement will be solicited as a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The award will be based on the best value to the Government. The exact closing date and time of the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be identified in the solicitation release.  It is the sole responsibility of the offeror to review the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) webpage frequently for any updates/amendments to the solicitation. All prospective offerors must have a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code and be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov . Interested vendors of this combined pre-solicitation AMS announcement should submit their Capabilities Statement with the intention of submitting a proposal. The respondent should possess NAICS Code 541690.  <BR>This combined pre-solicitation notice and AMS announcement requests corporate qualifications from offerors responding to the INSCOM I2 Biometrics Services Acquisition. This announcement requests information from prospective offerors allowing the INSCOM G3 Biometrics Division to review and assess the likelihood of each respondents ability to provide the services and supplies needed to fulfill the I2 Biometrics requirements. Based on an assessment of each prospective offerors response to this notice, the firm will be notified as to whether it is considered a viable competitor for the I2 Biometrics contract. Notification of a prospective offerors non-viability is advisory, and respondents so notified may submit proposals should they so choose. <BR>The authority and basis for utilizing the AMS process is contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202. <BR>2.0 	Advisory Multi-Step (AMS)<BR>This combined pre-solicitation notice and AMS announcement is being conducted to allow potential offerors to submit qualifying documentation demonstrating their corporate qualifications which will allow the Government to advise them about their potential to be viable competitors for the I2 (Biometrics) acquisition. The AMS process is accomplished at minimal cost to the potential offerors and the Government by asking interested organizations to submit limited information that focuses on their corporate capability and experience. The Government will assess all responses in accordance with the published criteria, and advise each offeror, in writing, whether they will be viable candidates.   Those offerors considered unlikely to be viable candidates will be notified and provided a general basis for that assessment. Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government, respondents identified as unlikely to be viable competitors may still participate in the resultant acquisition, as long as they recognize the inherent risks and costs of doing so. <BR>3.0	 Introduction to the I2 Biometrics Acquisition<BR>INSCOMs intention is to continue acquisitions of I2 and Biometrics support services and technologies at the current contracted levels and at higher levels if required by future conditions, and also to provide the capability to acquire new I2 and Biometrics technologies and services as they become available in the marketplace through the contract resulting from this acquisition.<BR>3.1	 Identity Intelligence <BR>INSCOMs  Biometrics mission is to conduct I2 Operations to include staff oversight, biometrics and forensics analysis, tools, training, watchlist management and operational support to Department of Defense (DoD), interagency and multinational partners in denying adversaries anonymity. <BR>I2 is defined as the information produced by the discovery, management, and protection of identity attributes (the biographic, biometrics, behavioral, relational, and/or systemic characteristics, by which an individual, person, persona, system, or discrete group thereof, can be distinctly recognized or known) in support of U.S. national and homeland security interests. I2 provides critical intelligence information that helps map and understand the human terrain.  Analysis consists of the integration of Identity Intelligence efforts within DoD and the United States Government.  Current capabilities and future technologies will be utilized to identify critical intelligence gaps and develop and apply fixes, develop theater/regional watchlists, and develop all-source products that enhance I2 related efforts.<BR>4.0	Services to be Provided<BR>4.1	I2 Biometric Services<BR>Interested  offerors for the I2 Biometrics program will provide a complete range of technical and professional support to provide INSCOM a worldwide contract to help manage I2 (Biometrics).

<SOLNBR>SOL-OAA-10-000022
<CONTACT>Roxane C. Wiser, Contract Specialist, Phone 2027120446, Email rwiser@usaid.gov - Vann R. Rolfson, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-712-5852, Email vrolfson@usaid.gov
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SYNOPSIS</span></strong><br /><br />The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) requests comments and questions about this <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DRAFT</span></strong> Request for Proposals (RFP) for the Clean Energy Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Critical Priority Countries (CPCs). CPCs are currently Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Sudan, and are subject to change. At a later date, a similar draft RFP for the Clean Energy IDIQ Contract for non-CPCs, i.e., the other developing countries USAID assists, may be issued for comments and questions.
<p>Through the Clean Energy IDIQ Contract for CPCs and the task orders that will be issued under it, USAID will fund technical assistance in CPCs to improve access to reliable and affordable clean energy, improve regulation and governance in the energy sector, demonstrate the use of innovative technologies and business models, and assist with the transition to a low carbon development trajectory.</p>
<p>Under the six energy sector themes of climate change, clean energy, energy poverty, energy sector governance, energy security, and energy sector reform, there will be a range of key activities such as: developing activities and strategy designs; creating enabling environments for clean energy development (including legal, regulatory and corporate governance structures and mechanisms); incorporating climate change into USAID Mission programs; increasing human resource capacities related to energy services; fostering private sector participation and investment; facilitating innovative financing approaches (such as revolving funds, bond pools, advance market commitments, credit guarantees, and structured finance); assessing the environmental implications of energy services; and improving disaster preparations, responses and recovery.</p>
<p>Contracts resulting from the RFP will be IDIQ with task orders funded individually post-award, either as cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) or firm-fixed-price (FFP) awards. USAID estimates awarding approximately five contracts, including approximately three unrestricted awards and approximately two reserved for small business. The RFP will not obligate USAID to award any contract or task order. There is no guarantee as to the number of IDIQ contracts that will be awarded or the number of task orders that any IDIQ holder will receive.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates that the maximum combined (shared) ordering ceiling of the contracts (including task orders) resulting from the RFP will be $400,000,000 over the five year ordering period. Each IDIQ contract holder will be eligible to compete for task orders until the shared ceiling for all contracts is reached. Task orders may be issued post-award, from USAID Washington, M/OAA/EGAT, or from USAID Missions overseas.</p>
<p>Funding is not yet available. There is no guarantee as to the amount of funds that will become available, nor is there any guarantee as to the amount of funds that any IDIQ contract or task order holder may receive.</p>
<p>USAID will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation and/or submission of comments, questions, and/or proposals.</p>
<p>Comments and questions about this <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DRAFT</strong></span> must be submitted by email to Contract Specialist Roxane Wiser at rwiser@usaid.gov and Contracting Officer Vann Rolfson at vrolfson@usaid.gov by 8:30 A.M. (Washington, D.C. local time) on Monday, May 17, 2010. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>USAID will not reply to the comments and questions, but will consider them in preparing the final version of the RFP. <br /></strong></span><br />The final version of the RFP for the base IDIQ contract will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (www.fedbizopps.gov) at a later date. The Government anticipates incorporating a Request for Task Order Proposal (RFTOP) into the final RFP (an RFTOP is not included as part of the DRAFT RFP). The Government anticipates that the task order proposal will be an evaluation factor for the base IDIQ contract.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are encouraged to register to receive email notifications by going to the fedbizopps page for the Clean Energy Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract for Critical Priority Countries, clicking on the "Watch This Opportunity" link, registering for an account to login, and following the instructions.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This is a Sources Sought synopsis for a competitive services acquisition (Reference FAR Part 37) as required by FAR Part 5.2. This Sources Sought Synopsis announcement market survey is for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. VENDORS SHOULD NOT SUBMIT FORMAL PROPOSALS UNTIL A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPSAL IS POSTED TO THIS WEBSITE.

<p>The 45th Contracting Squadron is issuing this sources sought notice for the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of the COBRA DANE (CD) Radar System. There are two entities involved: the CD Radar System, located at Eareckson AS, Shemya, Alaska, and the COBRA DANE Upgrade (CDU) Software Maintenance Management Facility, presently located in Woburn, MA. CD is an L-Band, computer-driven phased array radar system, whose primary mission is data collection in support of arms control and treaty verification of foreign strategic missile tests. Principal customers are the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), State Department/Arms Control, Technology &amp; Analysis (AC/TA), Missile Defense Agency (MDA)/Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), and Space Command Space Surveillance for maintenance of the USAF catalog of orbiting objects, including observation of New Foreign Launches (NFLs) and Space Object Identification. The offeror shall have responsibility of all facets of Operations &amp; Maintenance support as follows:</p>
<p>a) Operations to assure system availability in response to all data collection periods of interest (POIs) 24/7, as necessary,</p>
<p>b) Organizational and limited Depot-Level Maintenance (DLM),</p>
<p>c) Material and specialized maintenance support</p>
<p>d) Fully integrated logistics support,</p>
<p>e) System engineering Hardware &amp; Software (H/W &amp; S/W) for sustaining and enhancing radar operations,</p>
<p>f) Configuration Management of all O&amp;M functions, including the CDU S/W facility,</p>
<p>g) O&amp;M of the CDU S/W Facility.</p>
<p>The offeror must have sufficient knowledge of phased array radar technology and subsystems, to include high power Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) transmitters, receivers, digital signal processing, and system computers. The CD AN/FPS-108 is one-of-a-kind radar system with critical performance characteristics and mission availability requirements. The offeror must have sufficient experienced technical personnel skilled in O&amp;M of advanced radar systems. Offerors must work with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and other vendors, or have organic facilities, to design, develop and fabricate replacement parts and subassemblies as they become obsolete or un-maintainable. As TWT technology is paramount in the CD system (96 Active tubes), offerors should emphasize their TWT experience (any band). Experience with PIN-Diode Phase Shifter and Time Delay Assembly maintenance and repair will be noted. Reverse engineering experience of obsolete components and assemblies will also be noted. Offerors must have expertise to develop and modify Ada software programs under VMS and UNIX operating systems, using the DEC Ada and Rationale Apex programming environments on VAX 6000-series mainframes and SUN workstations. Software engineering requirements are applicable to both on-site and at the CDU S/W facility. Detailed knowledge of data collection and space surveillance radar algorithms, and data analysis to determine system performance and data processing are essential. Offerors must provide personnel to operate and maintain all interior on-site and CDU S/W facility communications systems, in addition to coordinating communications anomalies with outside agencies. Communicators must be well versed in DoD communications procedures and maintain SECRET clearances to handle COMSEC accounts. Offerors need to demonstrate logistics capabilities to support remote locations with parts, supplies and equipment. Successful offeror will be provided all on-site GFE, spares, Precision Measuring Equipment (PME), and all GFE at the CDU S/W Facility and will be responsible for all property and configuration management. Offerors must have sufficient expertise to perform all scheduled and unscheduled (preventive and corrective) maintenance. Offerors will serve as the technological interface with Government and support contractors, along with user agencies, to resolve technical deficiencies.</p>
<p>This proposed contract is being considered as a set-aside under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 541330. The size standard for NAICS 541330 is $4.0M. The government is interested in all small businesses including (8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that are interested in performing this requirement. The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business) anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision. The RFP will be available electronically on or about 20 Apr 09 on this website only. Fax, telephone, written or email requests for the solicitation package will not be honored. The anticipated award date will be on or around 31 Dec 2010. A firm-fixed price (FFP) contract is anticipated. The anticipated contract is for a base year plus four (4) one-year option periods.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Security Guard Services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The general scope of work for these Security Guard Services will require the contractor to procure armed guard services which provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, information, facilities, United States government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage, and terrorism.  Requirements are further defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The current version of the PWS is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  Services will be performed at the MMAC.  Interested parties are also encouraged to visit the MMAC home page, via www.faa.gov, FAA Offices, Regions & Center Operations.
This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) of 1997.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options.
The procurement action resulting from this Announcement/SIR1 will be a set-aside for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) that are expressly certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.  Only those 8(a) vendors that are certified under the SBA will be allowed to participate in this Announcement/Screening Information Request (SIR1).  To be considered, a vendor must be classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services - $18.5/million.  Each firm claiming 8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this Announcement/SIR1.  Firms are to submit an FAA Business Declaration form with their response to this Announcement/SIR1.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each vendor's program eligibility.  
In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.  
This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the Announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies that are certified under the 8(a) program an opportunity to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this Announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the down select process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this Announcement/SIR1.  A firm must be classified as an 8(a) firm at the time of submission of cost/price offers submitted in response to the next phase, SIR2/Request for Offeror (RFO), to be considered for contract award.
Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this Announcement/SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 10 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.  
SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.  
(Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable).
1.  Past Performance and Experience:
(Note: Past performance represents "how well" an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has "done it."  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the PWS.)
	(a) In order to be determined acceptable vendors must have five years experience in performing security guard services as identified in the attached PWS.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  Vendors shall provide a list of relevant past and present contracts performed for Federal, State, or Local Governments or commercial sources within the past five (5) years involving effort of same or similar complexity, magnitude and level.  The vendor's documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information stated below.(i)	Contract number and contract type(ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.)(iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options)(iv)	A brief description of the contract effort(v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort(vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the 	Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc.	(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor's performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process.
2.  Organizational Management and Staffing:
Vendors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 75 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to: a spreadsheet containing a list of employees and their managers, and the contracts on which they performed, etc.  
Interested firms that can comply with and meet the special standards of responsibility addressed in this Announcement/SIR 1 should respond with their documentation in writing to:

The date and time for receipt of responses is 2:00 p.m. local time, May 21, 2010, (electronic; e.g. facsimile or e-mail, responses are not permitted).  Any responses received after 2:00 p.m. local time, May 21, 2010, will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined unacceptable; therefore, not considered as one of the qualified companies.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary.
AMS Clause, 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting, AMS Provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals, and AMS Provision 3.9.1-3, Protest, are applicable to this SIR.  Offerors and contractors may obtain the full text via Internet at: http://conwrite.faa.gov.

<DESC>This Sources Sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Institutes of Health, NIH.  The purpose of the Sources Sought is to seek the availability and capability of small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owed Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) and Service-Disabled  Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB] that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein: 

NIH is a very dynamic organization which responds to the initiatives of not only the individual researcher, but to Institute Directors, and US Congressional mandates.  Research has an inherent inefficiency and many initiatives are readily abandoned and replaced by other initiatives in a slightly different direction.  These program changes are reflected in increases and/or decreases in the demand for the Medical-Surgical products that the NIH requires.

The National Institutes of Health NIH Supply Center (NIHSC), located in Gaithersburg, MD anticipates a requirement for all medical-surgical instruments and consumable products that are currently utilized in surgical procedures and experimentation.  The NIHSC anticipates that this requirement may include both its current medical-surgical offerings, and those contained in the catalog(s) of potential successful vendors.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 423450.  The related small business size standard is 100 employees.

If an associated solicitation is released, the following are special provisions applicable to all orders for delivery to the NIH Supply Center.

They are as follows:

1.	Deliveries shall be made to the NIH Supply Center, henceforth referred to as the NIHSC.  Located at 16050 Industrial Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, Suite 300.
a.	Deliveries shall be made between the hours of 7:30am & 3:30pm Monday-Friday with the exception of all Federal Holidays or when special delivery arrangements have been made in advance with the NIHSC.
b.	Customer Service phone numbers are 301-496-9156, or 301-496-9157 where appointments for deliveries can be made.
c.	ALL SHIPMENTS shall be clearly marked with the Order Number visible on the packing slip/delivery ticket as well as the outer package or container.
2.	All items delivered under this order must be exactly as described on the order in accordance with the item description(s), standard packaging, and marking  requirements. No substitutions will be accepted.
3.	If the product contains a UPC Code number identifying the product at the unit of issue (UI) then the NIHSC can/will cross reference product information into the receiving database with the NIH local stock number so that the product can be received.
4.	The packing slip will contain BOTH the UPC Code number and the NIH locally assigned stock number matching the UPC Code with the NIH stock number so that the receiver can correctly identify and receive product into the NIH stock.
5.	If the goods or products DO NOT have a UPC Code number then the products will be marked with the locally assigned NIH stock number/barcode number.  The barcode label shall be 3-of-9 code as per current FED. STD NO. 123 and Military Standard, MIL-STD-I 189.  The 13 digit National Stock Number for the specific item shall be marked below and the bar code symbol.  VENDORS MUST INCLUDE THEIR COMPANIES NAME ABOVE OR BELOW THE BAR CODE FOR EACH LABEL.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHER, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a Sources Sought notice with the intent to award a sole source contract to Keyence Corporation of America (Keyence) under the authority of FAR 6.302 because Keyence is the original manufacturer and supplier of the digital microscope described in this notice and is uniquely qualified to provide an optical lens and high magnification stand that will directly attach and integrate to its proprietary digital microscope as described below. Notice is provided as information to the marketplace, market research, and is an invitation for any other qualified companies to express their interest in and demonstrate their capability to perform the anticipated work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span><br />The National Transportation Safety Board is an independent Federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant accidents in the other modes of transportation -- railroad, highway, marine and pipeline -- and issuing safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.<br /><br />The NTSB has a requirement to accurately and effectively document factual evidence on transportation accident components and systems. The NTSB partially accomplishes this requirement through digital photography using a Keyence VHX-600 digital microscope. The NTSB first purchased the Keyence VHX-600 digital microscope from Keyence in 2007. The NTSB has used the digital microscope as a system for accurate and effective photo documentation of accident components. <br /><br />To aid in the photographic documentation of accident components, the NTSB requires an optical lens and stand with a zoom range of 100X to 1000X as an accessory for the existing Keyence VHX-600 microscope that will directly attach and integrate with the microscope.<br /><br />Specifically, NTSB has a requirement for the following items:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Part # VH-Z100UW. VH Zoom Lens with DIC 100x-1000x Double'R Zoom Lens. Quantity 1. <br />2. Part # OP-86927. SCP Filter Set Filter. Quantity 1.<br />3. Part # OP-86943. HDIC Prism Set Filter. Quantity 1.<br />4. Part # OP-84430. Dual-light Base Unit for VH-Z100R For VHX. Quantity 1.<br />5. Part # OP-72402 Illumination Adapter Stand. Quantity 1. <br />6. Part # OP-72405. Polarized Illumination Ring. Quantity 1.<br />7. Part # VH-S5 Stand for high Mag lenses. Quantity 1.<br />8. Part # VHX-S15H. Motorized Stage for VH-S5 3D Profile Measurement. Quantity 1. <br />9. Part # OP-51620. Lens Holder for VHX-S15. Quantity 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Keyence digital microscope, zoom lens, and high magnification stand is a proprietary system and requires the appropriate and compatible equipment to function. Keyence is the only known company that supplies compatible equipment to its proprietary microscope. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Required Capabilities</span><br />Sources capable of satisfying this requirement as described above must provide equipment that is compatible with the existing Keyence VHX-600 microscope. The equipment must directly attach and integrate with the Keyence VHX-600 microscope. The equipment must increase the functionality of the existing Keyence VHX-600 digital microscope by increasing the magnification range of the system with a zoom range of 100X to 1000X. The contractor's lens must provide enhancements by incorporating Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) and polarized light viewing and a stable stand for higher magnifications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements are invited to submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information, which must be prepared specifically in response to this notice should, must include: (1) identification of company or organization; (2) an assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements; (3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact; (4) notification of business size and /or special status; and (5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall adhere to a ten (10)-page submission limit plus web links and any specialized product descriptions. The statement of qualifications should include only information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise, and experience to perform the requirements described in this notice. General marketing material should not be included. The NTSB prefers that companies do not submit proprietary material. However, the Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by NTSB. Parties must submit information within four days of publication of this notice. NTSB will not return capability statements and the supporting documentation submitted in response to this notice. Telephone responses and inquiries will not be accepted. You may email questions regarding this notice to the issuing office to Bryan Moy via email at: <a href="mailto:bryan.moy@ntsb.gov">bryan.moy@ntsb.gov</a>.</p>

<p><br />THIS IS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to conduct market research ONLY to determine the degree of interest and capability of U.S. Small Businesses in providing international office management setup, administration and support services to the U.S. Department of Commerce in Kiev, Ukraine.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) is a U.S. Department of Commerce initiative funded in part by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department of State to help achieve U.S. foreign policy goals through commercial legal reform in developing, transitional and post-conflict countries around the world.</p>
<p>The goal of CLDP's Kiev, Ukraine satellite office is the adoption of a myriad of laws regulations, and practices adopted under the platform of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and, ultimately, WTO membership. These offices aid CLDP with implementing programs and managing relationships with the local U.S. Embassy, host country government officials and other local interlocutors. The U.S. Department of Commerce awards contracts to U.S. contractors to hire local personnel (i.e. local attorneys, program specialist, website administrators) to provide office management, set up and support services to the satellite office and provide expertise into the local laws and political systems.</p>
<p>The Ukraine satellite office runs a website which provides information on previously unavailable information to the public. This website also provides information on trade topics, news, and legislative developments in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>U.S. Small businesses responding to this Sources Sought announcement should have the experience and capability of providing a wide range of office management setup, administration and support services overseas. This includes being able to furnish the necessary personnel (i.e. local attorneys, program specialists, website mangers, etc), facilities (i.e. office space), materials, equipment, supplies, utilities, and any other logistic and administrative related services in support of an overseas office's management setup and support.</p>

<p>DLA Request for Information</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI), as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The Government is issuing this RFI in an effort to understand market availability, technical characteristics, and functionality of Information Technology (IT), tools, or products capable of satisfying the technical, functional, and/or operational capabilities described in this RFI. <br />This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), Request For Quotation (RFQ), or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to any eventual acquisition approach. All information received from this RFI will be used for planning and Market Research purposes only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or use of such information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the information received.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) currently operates and maintains numerous software applications in support of its logistics mission. These include legacy systems, contemporary systems, and emerging systems. There are a large number of DLA employees and consultants directly related to supporting these Information Technology (IT) systems and infrastructure at the various DLA facilities. Decentralized responsibility and execution for operations and support of logistics systems has led to the creation of a large number of unique applications, each requiring individual and specialized support. <br />This RFI defines a System as: "The hardware, firmware, and software used as part of the Information System (IS) to perform DOD information functions." This definition includes computers, telecommunications, automated information systems, and automatic data processing equipment. IT includes any assembly of computer hardware, software, and/or firmware configured to collect, create, communicate, compute, disseminate, process, store, and/or control data or information, per DoDI 8510.01 Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) Instruction, DoDD 8500.01 Information Assurance, and various NSA and NIST supplemental guidance.</p>
<p>Over the past several years DLA has migrated its applications from a decentralized operations model into centralized data centers, first at commercial sites and then at Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) at the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Application production is currently at the DECC located in Hill Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah and the application Test, Development and Staging will be located at the DECC in the Systems Support Office in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. The applications in these sites that are fully compliant with DOD security regulations are operated in DISA controlled enclaves. The other applications, including the test and development, are operated in enclaves are under DLA control.</p>
<p>Applications that require modification or retirement are currently in the DLA controlled enclaves identified as the DLA Ogden Enclave (DOE) at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. DLA's intent is to reduce the applications in the DOE by either re-engineering them to fully comply with the DOD security regulations and migrate them to the DISA controlled enclave or to return them to DLA facilities to be replaced or retired. All staging will eventually be migrated to DISA managed facilities. Applications that cannot be so migrated will be converted to the DISA Customer Designated Approving Authority (DAA) Accredited Enclave (CDAE). Network access to the DISA facilities will be provided by the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet). Network access to the DOE and CDAE facilities will be provided by the DLA Enterprise Telecommunications Network (ETN).</p>
<p>DLA is interested in industry capabilities and best practices in regards to providing support services and database support. Specifically DLA is interested in realizing savings in operations, acquisition, licensing and maintenance of the servers, applications, databases, networks, and facilities.</p>
<p>DLA's considerations/goals are:</p>
<p>a) Consolidate System Administration and Information Assurance for DOE servers, applications, storage, and operations and thereby reduce cost;<br />b) Provide processes and procedures to improve efficiency by decreasing incident response times, performing root cause analyses, and streamlining management and reporting;<br />c) Reduce vulnerability;<br />d) Improve reliability; and<br />e) Set the foundation for effective management of DLA Information Technology assets.</p>
<p>The anticipated benefits of these support services are:</p>
<p>a) A modern and flexible IT infrastructure;<br />b) Support the standardization of application development through the consolidation of test and development environments;<br />c) A reduction in the IT inventory (servers, applications and storage) and the associated costs through an improved use of equipment and the consolidation of applications when possible;<br />d) A more effective enterprise Information Assurance (IA) implementation through reduced vulnerabilities and centralized system administration;<br />e) An expanded disaster recovery capacity and Continuity Of Operations (COOP) capable of managing a growth in DLA applications and users;<br />f) A reduction in the total cost of ownership; and<br />g) Assist DLA PMO in coordinating IA certification and accreditation activities. <br />3.0 Statement of Need<br />DLA is researching support services for the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Ogden Enclave (DOE) Production and Test/Development environments currently located at the Defense Information System Agency (DISA) Hosting Center in Ogden, Utah. These support services include but are not limited to: Systems Administration (SA), Information Assurance (IA), Certification &amp; Accreditation (C&amp;A), and incident, problem, and configuration management utilizing DISA owned tool set (e.g. IT Service Management (ITSM)), and Program Management. In addition, support services will be required for migrating the Test/Development environment from its current location in DISA DECC Ogden to the DISA DECC in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>4.0 Information Requested<br />For this RFI, DLA requests a demonstration of innovative, state-of-the-art technology solutions, to provide for the successful transition of current management responsibilities for the DLA Ogden Enclave (DOE) to the DISA environments through a process of knowledge transfer sessions and training activities. Specifically, DLA is interested in the following four (4) capabilities:</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (not a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5) to determine the capability of potential sources and the availability of commercial sources pursuant to FAR Part 10.  

This notice is issued by the U.S. Coast Guard Shore Infrastructure Logistics Center, Norfolk, VA to identify sources capable of providing all labor, materials, equipment, and personnel necessary to support USCG Air Station Atlantic Citys (ASAC) unit-specific aviation training program.  ASAC is located at the FAA Technical Center in Egg Harbor Township, NJ, but all work will be completed in the general vicinity of Atlantic City.   The contractor will be responsible for providing and operating a vessel in support of the U.S. Coast Guards unit specific aviation training program.  As such, the contractor shall provide a vessel and all necessary management supervision, personnel, labor materials, fuel and equipment required for supporting helicopter crew hoists, rescue swimmer operations, use of force judgmental training, and any aerial delivered material used to fulfill Air Station Atlantic Citys training requirements.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The U.S. Coast Guard anticipates soliciting and awarding a contract for a base plus four option years, if exercised by the Government, beginning upon award. 

The vessel shall be similar to the Coast Guards 41 Utility Boat (UTB). The vessel should be capable of maneuvering and operating as a stable platform at idle and or low speeds and therefore should be of the displacement hull type.  Similar to the 41 UTB, the contract vessel should be no smaller than 38 feet and no greater than 50 feet in length.  The vessels beam shall be no less than 11 feet and no greater than 16 feet.  Mast must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 25 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed or folded (e.g. antennas) prior to commencing operations.  Gross vessel weight shall be 10 tons minimum.  Minimum speed is 0 knots (dead in the water) and able to maintain up to 10 knots for at least 5 hours.  Ideal vessel speed for training is approximately 5-10 knots for a period of 1 hour.  Vessel must be capable of maintaining a heading of + / - 10 degrees while operating under a Short Range Rescue (SRR) H-65 helicopter producing an average peak velocity of 90 knots of rotor downwash in varying sea states and winds depending on site.  An extremely shallow draft vessel is undesirable due to drift characteristics when subjected to rotor downwash; draft shall be between 4 to 6 feet.  Similar to the 41 UTB, the minimum deck area should be at least 64 sq. ft on the aft fantail portion of the vessel to allow a minimum of two crew members to safely conduct hoist operations.  Deck area must be free of all obstructions, and must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 20 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed or folded (e.g. antennas).  

A solicitation will be issued shortly and will be synopsized on the FedBizOpps Electronic Posting System at www.fedbizopps.gov.  It is the potential offer's responsibility to monitor this avenue for release of any future solicitation or synopsis. 

The applicable NAICS Code is 488390 (Other Support Services for Water Transportation) with a size standard of $7.0 million.  For the calculation of annual receipts and number of employees see parts 121.104 and 121.106 in SBAs Small Business Size Regulations, http://www.sba.gov/tools/resourcelibrary/lawsandregulations/index.html

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences intend to award a sole source, one year firm fixed price contract, in accordance FAR Part 12- Acquisition of Commercial Items to the University of California, 1001 Potrero, San Francisco, CA 94103. The University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) has the only yeast library for botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). No other antibodies have been able to give the same quality of results as UCSF. CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are classified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as one of the 6 highest-risk threat agents for bioterrorism (the "Category A agents"), due to their extreme potency and lethality, ease of production and transport, and need for prolonged intensive care. BoNTs have been produced and weaponized by rogue nations and deployed by terrorist groups. BoNTs can intoxicate via the aerosol or oral route and are the most poisonous substances known; a human oral LD50 being approximately 50 ug. As a result of this potency, sensitive assays are needed. Assays would be used both to screen for and detect the presence of BoNT in high volume food products, such as milk and other beverages, as well as for rapid and sensitive diagnosis from the serum of intoxicated individuals. Such assays must be: 1) very sensitive; 2) detect active BoNT; and 3) be able to function in complex sample mixtures such as milk and serum. The CDC has developed a sensitive mass spectrometry assay that detects BoNT cleavage of synthetic toxin substrates. For this assay to work in complex mixtures, a sample preparation step is required which consists of using an antibody to capture the toxin. This is an absolute requirement for the assay to function.</p>
<p>UCSF has been generating high affinity monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the botulinum neurotoxins. For this proposed work to continue, the collaboration with CDC will: 1) generate and evaluate mAbs for mass spectrometry based detection of the remaining BoNT serotypes including BoNT/D and BoNT/C-D mosaics and BoNT/G; 2) provide adequate quantities (100 mg/year) of each of the reference antibodies for the seven BoNT serotypes to allow adequate quantities of antibody for diagnostic testing; 3) generate and provide stable cell lines expressing each of the seven reference antibodies to the CDC to enable antibody production going forward; and 4) generate ricin binding IgG which can be used for sensitive detection of ricin by mss spectrometry.</p>
<p>CDC believes that UCSF is the only source available to provide this product that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurment based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 611310.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Thaddeus Rollins via email to tnr6@cdc.gov using the reference number 2009-Q-11261 in the subject line, no later than 5:00 pm Eastern Time, 29 May 2009.</p>

<SUBJECT>Abaqus and Isight Software Licenses Sole Source Notice of Intent
<SOLNBR>NB855120-A-04949
<RESPDATE>051410
<CONTACT>Keith Bubar, Phone 3019758329, Email keith.bubar@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory, intends to negotiate with Dassault Systemes Simulia Corporation.; Providence, RI, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to provide Abaqus Analysis tokens, Abaqus/CAE tokens, and Isight products.
<p>Abaqus is a finite element analysis program that is used to simulate the behavior of complex mechanical systems such as bridges, vehicles and a wide variety of mechanical tests. Isight works directly with Abaqus to explore how these systems respond to varying conditions.</p>
<p>The requested Abaqus + Isight license is a continuation of an existing Abaqus + Isight license that NIST researchers have been using for more than 5 years. Extensive simulations and macro-programs have been written during this period and these can only be run using Abaqus. Switching to a different finite element package would require at least 6 months of full time re-training and another 6 months to convert all of the required simulations to the new program. Since Abaqus simulations are an integral part of several critical projects, the resulting full year delay would seriously affect the work of additional scientists working on these projects. The cost of converting to a different finite element package would greatly exceed the cost of the Abaqus licenses.</p>
<p><br />Based on recent market research, Dassault Systemes Simulia Corporation is the sole source of all Abaqus, Abaqus/CAE, and Isight products. They are the only known company authorized to provide the requested tokens and packages. Below is a description of the items required:</p>
<p><br />CLIN 0001<br />Quantity: 1; Unit: LO<br />Sixty (60) Abaqus Analysis Tokens (Abaqus Standard and/or Abaqus Explicit), and Four (4) Abaqus/CAE Tokens<br />Period of Performance: June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011</p>
<p>CLIN 0002<br />Quantity: 1; Unit: LO<br />One (1) Isight Gateway Package, One (1) Isight Plus Pack Design Driver Package, One (1) Isight Data Matching Component<br />Period of Performance: August 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011</p>
<p><br />The NAICS Code is 511210 with a Size Standard of $25.0 million. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Dassault Systemes Simulia Corporation for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST and are authorized by Dassault Systemes Simulia Corporation to provide these services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any information or questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is seeking technical whitepapers from commercial entities ("submitters") to provide recommended technical concepts to improve the performance of Passive Radio Frequency Identification (pRFID) to provide zonal coverage at distances in excess of 100 yards. Long Range pRFID research thus far has produced solutions for commercial retail operations, industrial rail car tracking (railroad infrastructure) and manufacturing (pharmaceutical) environments, but needs more innovation in a cargo distribution setting where exposure to a variety of environmental and frequency factors would prove or disprove the value of the technology. This technology must be able to accurately gather pRFID tag data distances in excess of 100 yards whether it is within a warehouse (static) or at outside but adjacent storage areas within the supply/transport facility compound (dynamic).
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Reduced pRFID hardware footprint <br />&bull; Hardware located in areas that do not interfere with business operations or cause local frequency conflicts<br />&bull; Work with established international commercial standard (ISO 18000-6C) tags <br />&bull; 100 yards radial coverage that can isolate individual tags to collect identification data and location<br />&bull; Solution should not require major changes to a site's supply chain business processes<br />&bull; Provide local metrics that are reportable to higher headquarters either via the system or COTS metrics analysis software<br />&bull; Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) compliant<br />&bull; MIL-STD-454N "Standard General Requirements For Electronic Equipment" compliant<br />&bull; The technology will be subjected to conditions in a variety of DoD Supply Chain nodes and may well be subjected to harsh environments:<br />o USAF Traffic Management Office receipt and transfers processes<br />o USAF Aerial Port cross docking operations<br />o US Navy Shipyard activities receipt and in-check processes<br />o US Army Consolidated Receiving Point (CRP)<br />o USMC Advance Traceability and Control (ATAC) retrograde</p>
<p>USTRANSCOM will use whitepapers submitted to assist in understanding feasible technologies and techniques to improve the pRFID infrastructure across the DoD and will help to shape USTRANSCOM research and development efforts for future capabilities. This RFI will expire thirty (30) calendar days after publication date at which time no other submitters will be accepted.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for a procurement contract, nor should this announcement be construed as implying any future solicitation by USTRANSCOM or any other government agency in this area.</p>
<p>Large and small businesses may respond to this announcement.</p>
<p>Whitepapers must not exceed 5 pages in length with the exception of figures, tables, or graphics which may be attached separately and referred to in the document. Papers should be UNCLASSIFIED.</p>
<p>No funding is available from the government to cover costs associated with this development.</p>
<p>Only written questions pertaining to this RFI will be accepted. Submitters will provide written questions to the primary point of contact listed below. All questions and answers will be published as an amendment to this RFI.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Program Contracting Activity Central intends to award a follow-on firm fix price contract on a sole source basis to Ethos Consulting Group (ECG), 212 W 2ND ST, Moorestown, NJ, 08057, the under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a);10 USC 253(c)(1) to provide advisory and assistance services, participate in strategic planning and program development for the HPC Program, assist with the leadership and management of the CELC Initiative and workgroups, promote the growth of the National Hospice-Veteran Partnership Program, advance quality outcomes through program development, education and research, and work collaboratively with national, state, and local community organizations interested in improving Veterans' access to high quality end-of-life care.  The government believes that ECG's specialized knowledge gained through previously awarded contracts would result in substantial duplication of costs which is not expected to be recovered by competition and would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. However, such capability information will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this and /or future procurements of this nature on a competitive basis. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the government.  A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the government in accordance with the authority and procedures prescribed in FAR 6.302-1 and FAR 6.304.  All inquiries must be submitted by email to Jonathan Jewel, Contract Specialist jonathan.jewel@va.gov by no later than COB Tuesday May 12, 2010 (Eastern Standard Time).

<SUBJECT>Biological Aerosol Confidence Check Device
<SOLNBR>OF05062010BACD
<RESPDATE>051310
<CONTACT>Omari A. Fennell, Phone 703-696-2475, Email omari.fennell.ctr@whs.mil
<DESC>The Joint Product Director for Advanced Detection Systems (JPD-ADS) under Joint Project Manager for Biological Defense (JPM-BD) is issuing a request for information (RFI) for potential sources of available technologies and products to support a proposed unified/common biological aerosol confidence check device.   This confidence device is intended to be used across multiple JPM-BD programs, with the potential use across Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) programs, to increase the operators confidence that a biological aerosol detection system is working properly.   A portable confidence device is essential in order to enhance user confidence with a given detection system and to measure the functionality of the system in a changing operational environment.  The confidence device could also be used to standardize test methodology and training on biological point detection systems.   Instead of continuously testing detection systems in a laboratory environment or chamber-type setting, it would be beneficial to bring the portable device to the location of the fielded/deployed system.  		
Important aspects of a confidence device and material are: it must be environmentally safe, user-friendly, pose no human health hazards, and operable with no more than basic personal protective equipment (goggles and gloves).  The dispersed material must mimic the appropriate size distribution of a biothreat agent in a uniform, reproducible, known quantity with a stable shelf life of at a minimum one (1) year.  A standardized material, field rugged disseminator, and integrated confidence device for detection systems are ultimate end goals. 
This RFI seeks submissions that will improve user confidence for biological detection systems. Vendors both domestic and international are encouraged to respond.  Small Business participation is preferred but not required. 

PART I  Technical Criteria.
Vendors with products in the Technology Readiness Level 7 or higher are of interest to support Government acquisition program(s).  

Confidence Device
	If batteries are required, must operate from Standard Rechargeable and Non-rechargeable Commercial or Military Batteries. 
	 (Operator) Set up time: Less than 5 minutes from tactical carry configuration to dissemination to the detector or collector
	Hand held / Field Portable
	Field Rugged and Environmentally hardened
	Easy to operate

Confidence Material
	Safe for inhalation and ingestion with accompanying MSDS
	Environmentally friendly
	Stable with shelf life of minimum 1 year
	Reproducible, uniform, known amount dispersed
	No special Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) required

PART II - Submission of Information.  Vendors desiring to respond to this request are asked to submit a white paper and a quad chart (available upon request) as a summary template.  Vendors shall also provide no more than three examples of their present and past performance dealing with similar type and complexity of work with commercial or government agencies.
White paper: Limit the number of pages to ten (10) total (Times New Roman, Font 12, one (1) inch margins) excluding cover and photos (included separately).  Describe confidence device technology used, current state of device and development plans to meet criteria stated in Part I. Also include tests planned/completed, confidence material used, Material Safety Data Sheets, step-by-step operational start-up and shutdown procedures (if any), required operator skill level, power consumption and sources used/adaptable to, confidence device physical dimensions (size (in x in x in),  weight (lbs), footprint (in^2), and volume (in^3)) , if battery-operable: battery weight (lbs), consumable (cost, quantity/cost per sample), shelf life, production capability, amount of material released, concentration of material, number of releases one device is capable of dispersing, cost of device as presently configured and photographs of complete device.  The Government is interested in any current commercial applications and/or licensing/intellectual property provisions.  One (1) electronic copy of the white paper, quad chart, and photos is required.
	To be responsive to this announcement, vendors must supply their information as requested by 13 May 2010 with an electronic copy sent to Leanne Chacon (Leanne.argue.chacon@us.army.mil ). Vendors are requested to provide the name of the Contact Person for their company, telephone number, FAX number, email and complete address with each submission of data.
The Government is under no obligation to select any participating technologies.  This Biological Aerosol Confidence Check Device RFI will offer participants an opportunity to provide unique technology and product information about their aerosol confidence device to JPM-BD/JPD-ADS.

<DESC>Synopsis: 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-40.

The Solicitation number VA-244-10-RP-0215 is issued as a sole source, request for proposal.  This acquisition is a sole source to Covidien, maker of ForceTriad electrosurgical equipment, under NAICS code 339112, which has a small business size of 500 employees.  

The technology device required will primarily be used to ligate vessels and divide tissue laparoscopically.  Without this device, patients will likely experience prolonged recovery time and more time spent in the hospital.  This device works better for patients because it provides an optimized combination of pressure and energy that works with the vessel to create a permanent, plastic-like seal.  This permanent seal leaves no foreign material behind, which otherwise could interfere with the healing process.  This device also reduces blood loss in some surgical procedures as well as the risk of needle stick injuries.  Other electrosurgical devices are not as effective and therefore cause greater risk to our patients.  Controlling the bleeding with cautery is not as durable and risks injury to the bowel.  Staples are costly and are not feasible in all surgical situations.

The following items are being procured:

1) 1 Electrosurgical apparatus EIL: ForceTriad

2) 1 ForceTriad mounting cart: FT900

3) 1 FTSW SGLE Ligasure: LS0300

4) 1 Bipolar GEM Footswitch: E6019

5) 1 Standard Footswitch: E6008

The requested items need to be delivered, on May 28, 2010 or earlier, to the Erie VAMC at the following address:

Erie VAMC 
135 East 38th Street
Erie, PA 16504

The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition; there are no addenda.

Offerors should include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with their offer.

The clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; there are no addenda.

The clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following numbers indicate the specific references in this clause that are applicable to this acquisition: 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 30, 33, and 39.

Offers are due to Paul Bosak at 4:30pm on May 14, 2010. The email address is paul.bosak@va.gov 

All questions should be submitted, in writing, to Jennifer Balsiger at jennifer.balsiger@va.gov

If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.<BR><BR>Delivery must be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO).  The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 30 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer.<BR><BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for renewal support for NetApp Hardware at CA/CST, SA-15.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with the Network Appliance equipment and the service that Network Appliance provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Network Appliance hardware.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product<BR><BR>

EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:
1) Technical Capability; 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance; and 4) Price. 

All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to price. 

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.  
 
Technical Capability: 
Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. All equipment must be new.  No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered for award.  Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs requirements. 

NIST will give stronger consideration to offerors whose proposed equipment exceeds the minimum requirements identified under the following specifications:
	i.    Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(v);
	ii.   Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(xxi);
	iii.  Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(xxii); 
	iv.  Component 1, MBE A, Specification 5(xxvi);
	v.   Component 3, Loading Chamber, Specification iv;
	vi.  Component 5, MBE B, Specification vi.

Experience: 
NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience building, delivering, and installing automated cluster based MBE systems.  The Contractor must demonstrate that they have manufactured, delivered and installed a minimum of three (3) such systems. 

Past Performance: 
The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  

In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST may evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.  

Price:
The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all contract line item (CLIN) prices, including all options, and determine whether that total is a fair and reasonable overall price to the Government.  

  (b) "Options." The Government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a quotation is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Pantak HF-320 (320 kV) X-ray System.
 
Brand Name Only Justification:   The Ionizing Radiation Divison of NISTs  Physics Laboratory has a requirement for an Pantak HF-320 (320 kV) X-ray System. 

NIST currently utilizes three Pantak X-ray systems in its laboratories.  One of these systems has failed and must be replaced with an identical system.  Replacing the failed system with an identical model will allow interchangability of parts with the other two remaining Pantak systems in use at NIST, compatibility with the existing custom-designed tube stand, heat exchanger, and shielding design in the laboratory, and direct comparability of the new systems beam qualities with the existing reference beam qualities.

NIST cites authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) as primary rationale for Brand Name Only Determination.
 
***Line item 0001 is a BRAND NAME ONLY requirement.  The Pantak 320 kV X-ray Unit may be new or refurbished.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-40.***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***</p>
<p>*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Liquid Chromatographic System. ***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art micro analytical instrumentation, ion mobility spectrometers, and inkjet printers for the development of trace explosive reference materials. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use trace explosive detectors. A critical requirement for NIST is to validate the quantities of trace explosives on samples such as test swipes, reference materials and polymer microspheres with encapsulated explosives. For this purpose, NIST has several systems in place, but these systems lack the capability to separate and detect explosive mixtures with high sensitivity and precision needed for validating trace explosives in liquid solutions. The proposed system is a critical and integral part of the standards development program for trace detection. A liquid chromatographic system is needed for precise separation and trace detection of explosives in a variety of complex matrices such as explosive mixtures and/or separation of explosives from polymer solutions.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Liquid Chromatographic System, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>General Requirements:</p>
<p>1. The system must be able to separate and detect trace explosives in liquids.</p>
<p>2. The proposed system shall not be based on mass spectrometry, since these detectors are currently well represented in our laboratory and cannot meet the reproducibility requirement. However, the system must be compatible and able to be interfaced with an Applied Biosystems 4000 Q-Trap.</p>
<p>3. The system must have an auto sampler, sample and column heater/cooler, solvent pump, fraction collector, and PDA detector with a dynamic range of 10 - 10,000 microgram per milliliter.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements:</p>
<p>1. The analytes cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol-tetranitrate (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT), poly (lactic-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and polystyrene butadiene must be separable and detectable below 10 micrograms in each of the following solvents: acetonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, isobutanol, methanol, ethanol, acetone, and dichloromethane.</p>
<p>2. For all required analytes, reproducibility of signals (relative standard deviation of the mean) at the 10 microgram level must be less than or equal to 2% RSD.</p>
<p>3. The system must be operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.<br />Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance, and price will be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.</p>
<p>Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are more important than price. Technical Capability is more important than Past Performance. The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of equality among quotations of the non-price factors.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature that addresses all technical requirements, and that clearly documents that the offered product meets technical requirements stated above.</p>
<p>The proposed system shall not be based on mass spectrometry, since these detectors are currently well represented in our laboratory and cannot meet the reproducibility requirement. However, the system must be compatible and able to be interfaced with an Applied Biosystems 4000 Q-Trap.<br /><br />Past Performance:</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product &amp; service provided and the Contractors history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates. Offerors must provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided. The Contractor must include the references name, contact person, and contact information in the quotation.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>Quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:</p>
<p>Visual and physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications:<br />1. Detection device is based on UV technology.<br />2. Detection device utilizes LC sampling system.<br />3. The system is operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.<br />4. Interfaced to an Applied Biosystems triple quad.</p>
<p>Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications:<br />1. Using standard materials supplied by NIST, the system will be required to detect any of the required analytes in solution at twice the LOD as specified by the supplier. The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor. The instrument must accurately separate and identify each analyte. Upon any failure, the test for that analyte will be repeated five (5) times. Accurate detection must occur in at least four (4) of those five analyses.</p>

Line Item 0001: One (1) Ultrafast Tunable Fiber Laser System, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications: 

1.	General:  System shall consist of a mode-locked fiber laser (master oscillator) with two optical outputs.  
a.	Output #1 shall be directed into one or more units that can generate tunable pulses over the wavelength range listed in the specifications below.  
b.	Output #2 shall be directly available to the end user through a fiber optic FC/APC or FC/PC interface.
  
2.	Wavelength coverage: In total, the system shall produce output pulses that are tunable at wavelengths between 850 nm and 1300 nm.  Stronger consideration will be given if a wider wavelength range can be achieved.  The system may be configured so that this wavelength range can be achieved through multiple system outputs, for example, with one output covering one portion of the spectrum and the other covering the remaining portion.
   
3.	Pulse temporal width: the pulse width shall be less than 2 picoseconds (ps) for wavelengths below 1000 nm, and less than 100 femtoseconds (fs) for wavelengths above 1000 nm. 
     
4.	Pulse spectral width: 
a.	The minimum achievable pulse spectral width shall be less than 30 nm or Fourier transform limited (whichever is larger). Stronger consideration will be given if pulse widths less than 30 nm, or if Fourier transform limited pulses, can be achieved. 
b.	Stronger consideration will be also given if the pulse spectral width is adjustable, provided that mode-locking of the master oscillator is maintained.
       
5.	Average power: the average power shall be at least 100 microWatts, with stronger consideration given if higher powers can be achieved.

6.	Wavelength tunability: as listed in specification #2, the system shall be tunable from at least 850 nm to 1300 nm. This wavelength tuning shall be enabled in a computer-controlled fashion (e.g., motorized rather than manual actuation).

7.	Stability: the system shall be turn-key.  It shall either be delivered pre-aligned or a service engineer shall visit within one month of equipment delivery to align the system.  Subsequently, the system shall remain mode-locked without re-alignment as long as only the wavelength and output power are adjusted.
    
8.	Repetition rate: the pulse repetition rate shall be between 20 MHz and 100 MHz.

9.	Form factor:  the overall system, including control electronics, shall fit within a space 5 feet wide by 3 feet deep by 18 inches in height.  Stronger consideration will be given to more compact systems.
  
10.	Computer control: The system shall come with electronics that allow it to be remotely controlled from a computer through a GPIB, USB, or RS-232 interface.
   
11.	Software: All software for computer control, such as Labview drivers or standalone programs, shall be included.  At a minimum, the software must allow for remote tuning of the laser output pulse power and wavelength.
 
Express Warranty

The contractor shall warrant the instrument for a period of at least one year.

<DESC>FDA houses the largest known repository of clinical study data, including unique high quality data on the safety, effectiveness and performance of drugs, biologics and devices, both pre- and post-approval. These data are not collected or stored in standardized format and, for this reason, cannot be evaluated across multiple studies, products or populations except with great difficulty. The goal of this project is to collaboratively build and use the standards, infrastructure (including scientific capacity), tools and policies needed to receive process and analyze this clinical study data. The infrastructure and approaches developed as a result of this project will enable pilots of comparative effectiveness and other complex research and evaluation using the agency's vast, but untapped, stores of patient safety and clinical efficacy data.
<p>The availability of a data warehouse for storing, organizing, and extracting scientific data about regulated products in a common "language" or format to support regulatory decision making underpins the success of any broader initiatives to comparatively evaluate product performance. This data warehouse will be developed in the Janus program.</p>
<p>At its full capacity, Janus will be a comprehensive clinical trial and population health data warehouse that facilitates access to and analysis of 21st century data sources (e.g., large quantity digital data that come from new imaging and "omics" technologies), and collation of that data with other sources of information on medical product effectiveness, safety, and quality. Janus will be interoperable with clinical (i.e., electronic health record) and other data sources and will include protocols for secure and reliable data storage and access, and analytic tools for data analysis.</p>
<p>FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) (http://www.fda.gov/Cder/) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) (http://www.fda.gov/CBER/) have been involved in the Janus development initiative since 2006, when the first of several iterative pilot projects for clinical trials data was launched jointly by FDA (http://www.fda.gov) and the NCI (http://www.cancer.gov/) through an Interagency Oncology Task Force (IOTF) (http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/relatedinitiatives/overview/iotf.asp). This pilot, funded primarily by NCI, has gone through several iterations since 2006.<br />Phase 1 of the project, which included requirements gathering, creation of a prototype environment, and implementation of the database as a proof of concept, was completed in January 2006. The Phase 2 operational pilot, which involved integration of two reviewer tools (PhaseForward Lincoln Technologies' WebSDM [http://www.phaseforward.com/products/clinical/ads/default.aspx] and Integrated Clinical Systems, Inc.'s JReview [http://www.i-review.com/index.php]) with the repository, included development of a validation and import facility, loading of validated datasets into the repository, and creation of analytical views (e.g., Study Data Tabulation Model [SDTM] views) to facilitate reviewer access to data maintained in the repository. Following completion of the work on this pilot in March 2007, NCI provided additional "gap" funding so that the team could continue to load SDTM submissions while the planning for the Phase 3 pilot occurred. <br />Phase 1 of Janus resulted in a proof of concept prototype. Janus Phase 2 established an essential architecture and concept of operations for Janus implementation. Phase 3 of the Janus pilot at NCI will include the tasks needed to implement an operational environment that supports the automatic validation, loading, and management of standard clinical trials data in the Janus repository and reviewer access to that data for comparative effectiveness research using the JReview and WebSDM reviewer tools.</p>
<p>The requirement of Phase 3 of the pilot at NCI will address tasks needed to transition to an operational environment that supports the review and analysis of clinical trials data for comparative effectiveness research-this operational environment will include the extraction, validation, loading, and management of clinical trial data in CDISC-compliant SDTM format into the Janus repository.</p>
<p>Key objectives are to:</p>
<p>&bull; Redesign, test, and implement the Janus database based on an updated logical data model that supports improved data integrity, relationships, and analytical functions. This work will include updating the specifications and services required to validate SDTM datasets, populate the Janus database, and create SDTM materialized views.<br />&bull; Develop a "standalone" STDM Validation Service that can be made publicly available to clinical trial sponsors to enable validation of their data sets using the same criteria to be applied by Janus. To accomplish this objective the Subcontractor will develop this service to the level where it has been in production, tested to work with early adopters, and can be easily deployed with appropriate documentation and minimal support. This service will not load data into the Janus repository as it is intended to be used as a preview or check of draft data sets before actual submission to FDA. Once data sets pass the SDTM Validation, sponsors will be able to submit them to Janus via the FDA gateway.<br />&bull; Develop a Load Service to automatically load data sets that are submitted to Janus and "pass" the SDTM validation checks via the integrated STDM Validation service into the Oracle database. An exception handling process for select datasets will be a component of this service.<br />&bull; Continue technical and operational support for the incremental loading and testing of converted legacy datasets or new SDTM datasets concurrently with Janus database redesign activities. This support shall include technical assistance with troubleshooting, handling, and resolving SDTM validation or Janus database load problems and programming support to resolve technical problems in the day-to-day operation of the pilot environment, including data load problems that are not related to data errors. Design, develop, document, and implement processes and procedures to support the operational functions of Janus including workflows and optimized queries to address the need for high volume interactions with the Janus repository.</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze requirements, develop, and implement operational enhancements to the Phase 2 pilot architecture, including functional and technical enhancements to the Janus repository database.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop requirements, test cases, and testing plans with FDA project managers and adopters and obtain and use specific clinical trial data from across three Centers-the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and some Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) for testing the system. Develop access management and security functions to allow role-based access to study data (e.g., only FDA reviewers can look at study data associated with a product application, any user can look at de-identified study data, etc.)</p>
<p>&bull; Integrate with appropriate caBIG Enterprise services to facilitate completion of all phase 3 Janus requirements and functionality.</p>
<p>Service design work will utilize the caBIG&reg; Enterprise Compliance and Conformance Framework (ECCF) documentation.</p>
<p>Using these objectives and project descriptions Subcontractor should describe how objectives further the enterprise-level trajectory of development of the Janus repository and will effectively enable the utilizing of the FDA's data on Comparative Effectiveness Research.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this acquisition is NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2010-160-RSF and is being issued as a Request for Quote. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-40. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541380.

The National Institute Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a requirement for site directed mutagenesis and assay development of 26 mutations and the transcriptional activation assay of mutants.

The period of performance is six months after project initiation.

This requirement is set-aside for small business.

BACKGROUND:

One of the principal goals of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) is to provide state of the art genomics analysis to deliver personalized medicine to its research participants and patient families.  As technical advances have allowed increased detection of genetic variation among patients the need for an increased understanding of the nature of these sequence variations has increased as well.  A functional genomics component to the characterization of detectable sequence variations is essential to inform the clinicians and families of the medical significance of the genetic findings detected in molecular studies.  Such information is essential for accurate genetic counseling in specific families as well as to formulate a general understanding of just who is at risk for disease and who is not.
The human GLI2 gene is one of the most commonly detected targets of mutation among HPE patients; however, as researchers and clinicians is frequently difficult to distinguish normal genetic variation from medically significant findings.  This contract is specifically designed to test the medical relevance of a panel of at least 26 genetic variations in this gene that have been described in patient populations with HPE and related clinical findings.  The functional consequences of this extensive panel of changes (the largest compilation in the world) will be compared simultaneously in order to determine relative detrimental effects and serve to provide personalized genetic information.  An aggregate statistic will be measured that can guide the interpretation of new variants detected in the future.  By such a comparison, NHGRI aims to provide data that will allow clinicians and researchers to better appreciate the role that the human GLI2 gene plays in human disease and allow for the characterization of links between particular genetic alterations and the resulting medical findings (i.e. a genotype-phenotype correlation).

Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most common developmental defect of the forebrain in humans and occurs in 1 out of 250 pregnancies.  The resulting malformation has a tremendous impact on pregnancy viability and early infant mortality.  The Muenke lab at NHGRI has been leading the medical community in the identification of genetic risk factors for this severe condition.  At least 12 genetic loci have been implicated as potential causes for HPE including the human GLI2 gene that is the subject of this contract.

Statement of Work:
This requirement has two key components: 1) the generation of all 26 individual genetic alterations in the human GLI2 gene in the form of 26 different plasmid DNAs with sequence verified changes introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of the normal gene supplied to them from the Muenke lab; 2) the establishment of a functional test that compares the activity of these 26 changes to the biological effects of the normal gene.  The NIH will provide the contractor with the test cell line to be used in this analysis along with published protocols for setting up the assay.  The contractor will have the responsibility to perform the assays and provide publication quality results.  The data provided is intended for publication in the medical literature to share with clinicians around the world the types of changes that are associated with disease risk and those that are not.  

The Offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items.

The Gilson high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is specifically designed for the Diacel chiral columns that NHGRI utilizes.  The Gilson HPLC is the only system that uses TRILUTION LC v2.1 software and utilizes deep and shallow well rinse stations to minimize sample carryover.  NHGRI has standardized on the TRILUTION software and all of the prep chemists are familiar with its operation.  

Adding the additional productivity this second and more robust system will provide makes the thought of using any other alternative a mute point.  NHGRI is currently using a Gilson HPLC unit as such it would not be in the best interest of the Government to purchase another systems as NHGRI it would take a significant amount of time and effort to reconfigure NHGRI analysis set up that the current HPLC system has been providing.

Some of the unique characteristics on the requested Gilson unit are the following.
A manual injector and an on-line pump injector.  The large pumps are capable of pumping up to 200 mL/min.  The expanded fraction collector is triggered by the accompanying dual wavelength detector.  The entire system is controlled via TRILUTION LC v2.1 software.  The synthesis of any NCE revolves around 3 basic steps.  1  the combinations of essential chemicals and reagents that will affect the needed reaction that creates a new chemical.  2  the separation of the new chemical from the unwanted reactants and side products created/used. 3  the characterization of the new chemical to assure that it is, in fact, what was intended.   The second step is a critical aspect of this protocol.  We recently ordered a set of Diacel chiral columns in a 50x500 mm configuration.  The Gilson system is specifically designed and configured to be used with these columns.  To effectively use these columns, NHGRI must be able to pump at up to 100 mL/min at a back pressure of 3000 PSI.  The Gilson system is configured to accomplish this task.  
		
The Offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items. As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 3) FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; 4) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; and 5) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions; 6) FAR Clause 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(I)	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT (II)	PAST PERFORMANCE (III)	PRICE  
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii),  the two non-price factors.  (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)  Offerors' proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, the Government will rate the products offered as either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.  
Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii).  Under this factor, the Government will rate past performance as either acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.    For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price.    
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   
(b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 
(c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has an acceptable record of past performance.  A proposal that receives a rating of acceptable on past performance is one that demonstrates little anticipated risk in the areas of quality of the product, timely delivery, and customer satisfaction.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies and subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement.   
Offers that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Thus, the Contracting Officer may determine it is an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 
(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/  .  All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

<p>A) BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan. Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.</p>
<p>The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian Republics. The U.S. Government's program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare. It ranks as one of the Agency's largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $115 million annually. The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 implementing organizations funded via acquisition and/or assistance mechanisms. The staff manages a program that addresses six program areas principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.</p>
<p>The Mission currently has three technical offices: Office of Economic Growth (EG), Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM), and Health and Education (HE) and is in the process of developing its new whole-of government strategy for each country and the region for 2011-2016 that will create greater focus of our development efforts and require significant restructuring of our implementation portfolio.</p>
<p>USAID Assistance Program in Turkmenistan totaling approx $8 million annually is geared to providing assistance in the development of economic, social and political reforms and helping to build a base for democratization.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>USAMRAA/USAMMDA has a requirement for a 100 vials of Sodium Stibogluconate Injection BP (Pentostam) containing 100 mg of perntavalent antimony per ml and each vial contains 100 ml. The product will be manufactured in March 2010 (approximate) with 3 year expiration date. USAMRAA intends to procure a sole source requirement for the supplies from the following organization: Glaxo Smith Kline Export Ltd., 980 Great West Road, Brentford, Middlesex TW8 9GS, United Kingdom. These supplies cannot be provided by any other organization and as such, it is in the best interest of the Government to obtain it from Glaxo Smith Kline Export Ltd. This requirement is a sole source contract based on only one source being reasonably available (FAR 13.106(b)(1). The Sodium Stibogluconate Injection BP is a medical drug used under the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) Application #14,150 for use in humans. The Office of the Surgeon General sponsored IND protocol is written and approved by the FDA specifically for Sodium Stibogluconate Injection BP (Pentostam) produced by Glaxo Smith Kline Export Ltd. Therefore, no other source of Sodium Stibogluconate Injection BP is authorized by the FDA under this IND. The U. S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA), as the sponsors representative, has overall responsibility for management of the protocol and the product. Pentostam is the IND product used to treat U. S. troops for Leishmaniasis in an active research protocol at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC). Leishmaniasis is a protozoal disease transmitted by sand flies and is endemic in many parts of the world including the Middle East, Southwest Asia and Africa as well as Central and South America. Infected humans may develop cutaneous, mucocutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis. The disease is a medical threat for military soldiers assigned in endemic areas and a major cause of morbidity in soldiers deployed to the Middle East. Glaxo Smith Kine Export Ltd. is the manufacturer and distributor. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 13. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations. Interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement may submit information about their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to: MAJ Bryan K. Preer, Contract Specialist via email at bryan.preer@us.army.mil no later than 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time,     13 May 2010. Submission should be emailed as either a PDF or Microsoft Office attachment. Submissions should be on company letterhead and include companys name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax number, DUNS Number, CAGE Code. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1). This award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures (FAR Part 13) and Best Value. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.<BR><BR>Thanks,<BR><BR>BRYAN K.

<p><br />52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (Jun 2008)<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (JULY 2009)</p>
<p>Alternate I (Apr 2002) Offerors shall include a copy of this provision with their offer.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items.(Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance <br />This is a best value, commercial item acquisition; award may be made for other than lowest price. The Government intends to award on an all or none basis to a responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation, and provided the Government with the best value, price and other factors considered. Offers that are significantly higher or lower than the government's estimate may be evaluated as posing a significant performance risk. <br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision) <br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

EVALUATION PROCEDURES/BASIS FOR AWARD The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract using FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the brand name items specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, conforming to the delivery requirement and; 2) quotes the lowest evaluated price. Information submitted by the offeror must be suficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the brand name items specified above. Quoters are  required to submit quotations for all CLINs. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

If these DoDAACs do not match, then the contractor shall correct the field(s) and notify the Contracting Officer of the discrepancy (ies).

In Phase two of the Agenda, attendees will be given a tour of the Maintenance Center Albany and the Distribution Management Center including all equipment storage facilities.  

This will not be a question and answer scenario.  The event is strictly for exposure to LOGCOM's capabilities in supporting the USMC's global mission.  Questions from participants will not be entertained in the interest of fairness to all.  MARCORLOGCOM personnel, including briefers, are not allowed to respond to questions from attendees specific to any one contract or business opportunity.

The agenda is attached for information purposes.

Attendees will be limited to no more than two (2) persons per organization/company.

The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking competitive quotes for an interactive web application for the purpose of facilitating the exchange of information between Veteran Administration Senior Executive Service members across program areas. VA wishes to apply new technology to address senior management communication and leadership challenges around VA transformation initiatives.   
The purpose of this project is to procure qualified contractors to:
"	Engage VA leadership in identifying across agency communication barriers and identify tools needed for executives to operate in a more cohesive manner.  
"	Develop an assessment report and plan with functionalities needed for creating an online community for VA executives. 

Implement collaborative management tools (CMT) for engaging the members of the Senior Executive Service (SES).  For example, a central, interactive repository of knowledge capable of providing ongoing resources to enhance performance and assist with VA transformation efforts for present and future SES members. CMTs will include but are not be limited to access to online educational resources and information.

The project described in this statement of requirements (SOR) regarding implementation of a collaborative website for VA executives is a key component of this transformational initiative.  The goal of this initiative is to build an online community among VA executives that will be used to:
Gain alignment around the Secretary's vision, 
Foster open communication between political leaders, members of the SES and other stakeholders, 
Promote idea sharing, constructive dialogue and collaboration across the Department, and
Empower groups to work together.

Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to procure qualified contractors to:

Engage VA leadership in identifying what  barriers may exist to communication across agency lines and what tools executives need to operate in a more cohesive manner;  

Develop an assessment report and plan for creating an online community for VA executives with the functionality it needs;

Implement collaborative management tools for engaging the members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) such as a central, interactive repository of knowledge that can serve as an ongoing resource for current and future SES members better doing their jobs and assisting with VA transformation efforts.   This will include but is not limited to access to online educational resources and information for members of the VA Senior Executive Service.  

Project Scope

Successful organizational transformation relies heavily on direct, ongoing, and effective communication between leaders, intermediate managers, and front-line staff.  VA wishes to apply new technology to address senior management communication and leadership challenges around VA transformation initiatives.   By developing an interactive web application, VA will facilitate the exchange of information among members of the SES across program areas.  

While technology solutions are important to success, the most important initial challenge will be not ones of technology, but of management. As such, the contractor shall assist the VA in conducting an assessment of political and career Senior Executives from the VA to take ownership, facilitated by the contractor that will form the basis of a clear plan for how to create an online community with the functionality it needs.

The action plan will include strategies for identifying the key challenges and issues facing the SES, gathering insights, building trust, and empowering members of the SES to engage in the mission of the organization..    

The contractor shall work in partnership with the VA on the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the assessment report including the selection, set-up and design of the collaboration tool(s) that are the basis of the SES online community. The contractor shall then assist in implementing the communications plan and launch strategy for the site with the SES. Lastly, the contractor shall assist the VA leadership monitoring the site and in setting up metrics to measure success.

The contractor shall design, develop, and implement a collaborative platform that may include the following functionality: 

Blogs - provide the ability to connect SES members with subject matter experts and each other in order to share ideas and foster discussion. 
Forums - create interactive learning communities of practice based on roles/functions (e.g. acquisition, human capital, information technology, etc).
Shared resources - provide users the ability to share valued online resources. 
Newsletters - provide users with brief summaries of leadership strategies and tools to assist SES in managing their challenges and share informational updates from leadership.
Fast track news bulletins/alerts - provide users with special notices/action alerts from the SEC/VA and his senior staff. 
Provide other functionality as required.

Assessment of Current VA Communications with SES

To leverage the collective knowledge of the VA senior leadership and build in a process for developing ownership, the contractor will assist the VA in conducting an assessment of the level and types of communications with senior leadership and explore potential issues of coordination, resource allocation, roles and responsibilities, and other management challenges.   This will form the basis of a clear plan for how to create an online community with the functionality it needs.
Examples for potential strategies for conducting this assessment include a combination of face to face and technological based approaches, such as interviews, an online survey, and a targeted online dialogue open to the SES to identify what barriers they see within the agency and what tools they need to operate in a more cohesive manner. The assessment report should define recommendations for implementation including strategies, deliverables, timelines, recommended roles of responsibility. 
       
Stage I Pilot Test and Evaluation:   Prior to full implementation of the recommendations outlined in the assessment, the set-up and design of the collaboration tool(s) which will form the basis of the SES online community will be tested among a group of SES at VA.  An important component of the test is to also formulate a communications plan and launch strategy for the site with the SES.

Stage II. Evaluation:  This will involve a more comprehensive assessment of the SES opinion regarding a number of features of the website that will inform immediate and ongoing needs for knowledge development and information required to effectively implement VA goals.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand. The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators , the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions. The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions. The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the PRAs ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor (RA) in the Middle East.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This Regional Advisor position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs. The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The Regional Advisor will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective Principal Regional Advisor, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the Principal Regional Advisor; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;<br />&bull; Coordinate and liaise with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassies, and USAID Missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;<br />&bull; Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report in accordance with OFDA guidelines, policies, and requirements;<br />&bull; Become certified and serve as an Agreement Officer's Technical Representative (AOTR) and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) for grants, cooperative agreements and contracts;<br />&bull; Serve as required as DART Team Leader or as a DART team member during a disaster response;<br />&bull; Maintain regular communications with the regional (and/or sub-regional) office in their area of responsibility and with OFDA/Washington;<br />&bull; Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.<br /><br />B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;<br />&bull; Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA's efforts in disaster response and management;<br />&bull; Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the incumbent's respective Regional Office and/or sub-regional team. Support may include but is not limited to assessment/evaluation visits, project design exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;<br />&bull; Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;<br />&bull; Work with representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs;<br />&bull; Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Regional Advisor will report directly to the Principal Regional Advisor. However, for certain activities, the Regional Advisor will coordinate tasks with the respective Regional Coordinator in OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Principal Regional Advisor will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives. The Regional Advisor is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Project also incorporates removal of an existing roof infill panel and replacement with permanent pre-cast concrete panel and associated roof repairs including expansion joint replacement.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide responses posed by potential offerors. The following questions were posed, along with their responses.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1:</span></strong><br />How tall of a rack is OK?<br />What type of power will I be able to plug the battery backup into?<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response 1:<br /></span></strong>1. The New 19 inch rack will go next to an existing rack that is 76 inches tall from floor to ceiling. It should be no taller than this because of ventilation considerations as the two cabinets will stand in an alcove together and need clearance at the top for air flow. Also, for cosmetic reasons we would like the rack to be black to match the existing one if that is possible.<br /><br />2. The electric circuits will be 120 volts, so the battery backups must use that. The vendor should tell us how many circuits are needed to power the configuration they bid. Low power ecco drives for disks may be important to reduce the number of battery backup units needed for the cluster.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2:<br /></span></strong>What type of 10 Gb Ethernet cable is required to connect to the 10 Gb Ethernet switches already in place?<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response 2:</span></strong><br />There is no 10Gb switching infrastructure in place. The vendor is required to provide both 1 Gb ethernet connectivity within the cluster (including switch) and to connect to our infrastructure. Separate 10 Gb or faster connectivity (including switch) must be provided within the cluster only. We will use the 1 Gb Ethernet for external connections. The vendor is therefore at liberty to select the cabling and switches they deem best for the high speed network within the cluster. The low speed networking should be Cat-5e for normal 1 gigabit Ethernet networking for connectivity to our existing infrastructure.</p>

<DESC>Description(s): <br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40.
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430. This acquisition cannot be conducted as a small business set aside because there is no U.S. Small Business Administration waiver to the non-manufacturer rule for NAICS code 423430. This requirement is being competed under unrestricted full and open competition.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because the user does not interact with the EIT product directly.</p>
<p>The Security Implementation &amp; Incident Response Team (SIIRT) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducts forensic investigations and uses a full packet network capture device. SIIRT requires a storage device for storage of large amounts of data from forensic investigations and storage of data from their full packet network capture device.<br /><br />This requirement consists of the two Contract Line Items below. Quotations shall be tailored to the exact items listed. The Contractor shall provide:<br /><br /><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CLIN 0001</span></strong></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><strong><em>Quantity:</em></strong> 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> Large storage device meeting the requirements&nbsp;below:<br />&bull; Largest storage capacity available within 4U, 19 inch rackspace; total capacity of at least 80TB<br />&bull; Completely OS independent. No special software drivers or server-based management applications required.<br />&bull; Redundancy of all active components <br />&bull; Individually hot-swappable components<br />&bull; Support of RAID 0,1,1+0,5,6<br />&bull; Support of Multiple RAID sets and multiple volumes per set<br />&bull; Integrated Fibre Channel for direct host connectivity <br />&bull; iSCSI or FCoE capability for network infrastructure connectivity (capability must work with the Linux 2.6 kernel)<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>CLIN 0002</em></strong></span> <br /><em><strong>Quantity:</strong></em> 44 <br /><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> Manufacturer certified 2000GB drives<br /><br />Quotations shall include terms and conditions of warranties for all items. The Contractor shall not require return of failed drives for warranty replacement.<br /><br />ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS <br />Paragraph (b) below replaces paragraph (b) in provision 52.212-1.<br />(b) Submission of quotations. Submit signed and dated quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on company letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations must include- <br />(1) The solicitation number; <br />(2) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; <br />(3) Technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with requirements in the solicitation. Item MUST meet exact specifications as laid out in the description above. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;<br />(4) Terms of any expressed warranty;<br />(5) Firm-fixed price for each CLIN and discount terms;<br />(6) Acknowledgement of solicitation amendment(s);<br />(7) Include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Quotations that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>NIST reserves the right to award a purchase order without discussions, based solely on the submission of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Delivery Location:<br />NIST<br />100 Bureau Drive<br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1000</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The award will be made to the responsible authorized offeror whose technically acceptable quotation is deemed to represent the lowest price.</p>
<p>Delivery due date: Within 30 days after Contractor acceptance of order.<br /><br /><br />***Please note, this solicitation was amended on May 6, 2010.&nbsp; The purpose of this amendment is to modify the requirements previously posted. The following changes were made:</p>
<p>1) The requirement for support of RAID 4 has been removed from CLIN 0001.<br />2) FCoE has been added as a possible specification for CLIN 0001. The storage device should offer either iSCSI or FCoE. It is necessary to provide one of these technologies because the unit to be purchased will not always be adjacent to the server processing the data. During a disaster event or facility maintenance event, NIST may be forced to use the existing network infrastructure to carry our SAN communication (we know the performance will be degraded, but we need the access). In this situation, we will not be able to run our own fiber in order to get the SAN Storage device connected to the host computer directly.<br /><br />As a result of this amendment, the response date is extended to May 18, 2010 at 12pm EST.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is SAQMMA10Q0134 and is issued as a Request for Quote. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-34. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334119 with a small business size standard of 1,000.00 employees. This requirement is a full and open competitive requirement. 

The Department of State (DoS) Office of Computer Security (CS) uses numerous tools and products to ensure the security posture of the Departments unclassified OpenNet system. One of the critical capabilities required by the Monitoring and Incident Response Division (MIRD) and the Cyber Threat Analysis Division (CTAD) is the ability to capture and store several weeks of complete network packet traffic. This capability allows the Computer Network Defenders (CND) to replay activity on the network to support investigation and remediation of incidents and threats. 

The Department of State requires a commercial product that can perform the following specifications:

The offered solution must be able to: Facilitate Identification of Malicious Email; Provide Enhanced Analytics; Provide Packet Capture Capability; Provide Alerting Capability; Provide anomaly detection capabilities; Provide Insight into Lateral Activity which is defined as moving from resource to resource while conducting malicious behavior;  The offered solution must  Identify Insecure Protocols and Practices; Must  Provide Warning and Indication Capability; Must  Provide Drill-Down Capability for Ambiguous Data; Must Reduce Time Required for Locating and Reconstructing Sessions; Must Comply with Integration and Operational Support Requirements which means it must physically integrate with standard datacenter racks and be supported by standard Datacenter environmental controls (e.g. power (110v) and air conditioning.

The system must monitor traffic flow both inside and outside point-of-presence firewall stacks at two locations.  Interface speeds will be gigabit copper and expect an average of fifty percent utilization.  Full packet capture analysis will be performed using this system with a sixty day data retention requirement.  Physical capture methods will be through both span ports and TAPS.  The system will be centrally managed, but analysis will be done through the user interface from multiple locations.  

Complies with FISMA, OMB A-11 and M-06-15 regulatory mandates.
Tuned for FISMA, NIST FIPS 200, SP-800-37, HSPD #12 requirements.

If your firm offers a commercial product that can meet or exceed the above specifications please respond to this combined synopsis/solicitation and your firms offer will be evaluated using commercial evaluation procedures as outlined in FAR 52.212-2 where technical capability will be more important than price, and technical capability will be more important then all other factors when combined.

<DESC>This is the second modification to solicitation W81K00-10-T-0091.<BR><BR>This modification is issued for the following purposes:<BR><BR>1. To address questions.<BR><BR>a. In section 5.3 of the solicitation, the annual volume is estimated at 750,000,000  cubic feet per year.  In Clin 1001AA the estimated quantity reads as 75,000 cubic feet per year.  Is this the actual usage per month or per year?  <BR><BR>answer:  The correct amounts for each option CLIN should be 100,511CF and usage is per year<BR><BR>b.  The previous modification dictates a fixed price for base year and for all 4 option years.  Is this correct?<BR><BR>answer:  The only change on the CLINs are on the option years quantities.  Original quantity 75,000 CF is changed to 100,511CF.  The option years dates are corrected on CLIN 1001AA, 1001AB to 1 Oct 2010 through 30 Sep 2011 and 2001AA, 2001AB to 1 Oct 2011 through 30 Sep 2012.  The base year and other CLINs remain the same.<BR><BR>c. The dates as written do not include a time frame for 1 October 2010 thru 30 September 2011.  Should that be the first year service dates?<BR><BR>answer:  The time frame for 1 October 2010 thru 30 September 2011 is the first option year.  Also the option years dates are corrected from the original solicitation on CLIN 1001AA, 1001AB to 1 Oct 2010 through 30 Sep 2011 and 2001AA, 2001AB to 1 Oct 2011 through 30 Sep 2012.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<DESC>VA798-10-RQ-0091 Amendment 1
Effective Date: 05/06/2010
The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received in response to solicitation VA798-10-RQ-0091 for CGFM Courses. The hour and date specified for receipt of quotes is not extended. 
1.	Question:   Dates of training: The period of performance is listed from May 24th, 2010 to May 23, 2015. Does that mean that first set of training will start on May 24th? Do you have specific dates or are the dates of the courses to be determined, subject to mutual agreement of agency and contractor? If there are no specific dates yet, are there any tentative periods of time and how far in advance will the dates be known (for example, will the dates for all six sets be known at the same time or will one set be scheduled at one time)?

Response: The dates will be determined, subject to mutual agreement of agency and contractor. The offeror shall be able to deliver 6 sessions of all three courses through August 2010. 

2.	Question: Locations: Are there any additional information on training locations other than the cities?
Response: The contractor will determine the site in the cities mentioned.
3.	Question: Courses Schedule: the document state that "each class/training event will consist of all three courses taught consecutively". These courses are six days in length and are usually broken down into two sets of three days each. Do you want these courses to be taught in six consecutive days? 
Response: The government would like the courses to be taught in a compressed schedule of five consecutive days. 
4.	Question: Facilities: The document states that the contractor will be responsible for providing facilities. Is there anything else included in "facilities" besides the meeting space (for example, food, parking fees, sleeping rooms, etc.)?
Response: The only thing required for the facilities is meeting space. 
5.	Question: Facilities: Is the provision of facilities an absolute requirement to providing this training- would the government consider a bid for just the training (instructor and materials) without providing facilities? 
Response: The Government must have quotes that meet all requirements of the solicitation including facilities.

<DESC>The Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is seeking technical information for a new, simultaneous DSC-TGA (Differential Scanning Calorimeter-Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer).  The simultaneous DSC-TGA is required to include the following at a minimum:  (i) capability of measuring both reliable weight change (TGA), and true differential heat flow (DSC) on the same sample from ambient to 1500oC.   (ii) This equipment should have a horizontal dual beam design that support precise TGA and DSC measurements without thermal drift and baseline correction.  The horizontal dual (2) balance mechanism (one for the sample and one for the reference), and a horizontal purge gas system with digital mass flow control and integral gas switching capability, are needed to minimize weight drift due to thermal expansion and the buoyancy effect of the purge gas.   (iii) The TGA sensitivity of 0.1 micrograms and the DSC sensitivity of 4 microwatts are needed for detection of weak transitions in small samples of polymeric materials.  (iv) The heat flow axis must be calibrated using sapphire as the calibrant over temperature range from ambient to 1500oC.   (v) Efficient furnace cooling, from 1500oC to 50oC in less than 30 minutes, is required for sample throughput.  (vi) The DSC-TGA must come with software for instrument control to tare, start, and modify or stop a run in progress.   (vii) The software should provide the ability to plot and do data analysis, and should be compatible with our existing thermal analysis systems from TA Instruments.   (viii)An USA manufacturer is required for the TGA-DSC to reduce parts and repair costs, and the risk of damage from shipping and handling.<BR><BR>This Request for Information should be considered an open call for providing the governments simultaneous DSC-TGA thermal equipment needs.<BR><BR>This RFI is solely for information purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any information submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the government for such information.<BR><BR>Any information/samples submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the government for such samples.

<DESC>Wild horses and burros free roaming on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 US. 1331-1340). As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands and placed in facilities for preparation to be placed in private maintenance through the Adopt-A-Horse program. b. The Wild Horse and Burro Holding Facility at Piney Woods (PW) is the primary holding facility for wild horses and burros awaiting adoption through the BLM's Eastern States Adopt-A- Horse program. Piney Woods routinely receives animals from western facilities and then ships them to adoption locations throughout the 31 eastern states. The facility will maintain approximately 150 animals throughout the year on a daily basis. The objective of this contract is to procure livestock panels and gates for the temporary holding of these animals when they arrive from the western facilities and await transport to adoption locations around the country. Piney Woods is a permanent year-round holding facility requiring the use of this equipment for the animals residing on the facility.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences intend to award a sole source, one year firm fixed price contract, in accordance FAR Part 12- Acquisition of Commercial Items to the University of California, 1001 Potrero, San Francisco, CA 94103. The University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) has the only yeast library for botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). No other antibodies have been able to give the same quality of results as UCSF. CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are classified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as one of the 6 highest-risk threat agents for bioterrorism (the "Category A agents"), due to their extreme potency and lethality, ease of production and transport, and need for prolonged intensive care. BoNTs have been produced and weaponized by rogue nations and deployed by terrorist groups. BoNTs can intoxicate via the aerosol or oral route and are the most poisonous substances known; a human oral LD50 being approximately 50 ug. As a result of this potency, sensitive assays are needed. Assays would be used both to screen for and detect the presence of BoNT in high volume food products, such as milk and other beverages, as well as for rapid and sensitive diagnosis from the serum of intoxicated individuals. Such assays must be: 1) very sensitive; 2) detect active BoNT; and 3) be able to function in complex sample mixtures such as milk and serum. The CDC has developed a sensitive mass spectrometry assay that detects BoNT cleavage of synthetic toxin substrates. For this assay to work in complex mixtures, a sample preparation step is required which consists of using an antibody to capture the toxin. This is an absolute requirement for the assay to function.</p>
<p>UCSF has been generating high affinity monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the botulinum neurotoxins. For this proposed work to continue, the collaboration with CDC will: 1) generate and evaluate mAbs for mass spectrometry based detection of the remaining BoNT serotypes including BoNT/D and BoNT/C-D mosaics and BoNT/G; 2) provide adequate quantities (100 mg/year) of each of the reference antibodies for the seven BoNT serotypes to allow adequate quantities of antibody for diagnostic testing; 3) generate and provide stable cell lines expressing each of the seven reference antibodies to the CDC to enable antibody production going forward; and 4) generate ricin binding IgG which can be used for sensitive detection of ricin by mss spectrometry.</p>
<p>CDC believes that UCSF is the only source available to provide this product that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurment based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 611310.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Thaddeus Rollins via email to tnr6@cdc.gov using the reference number 2009-Q-11261 in the subject line, no later than 5:00 pm Eastern Time, 28 May 2009.</p>

<DESC>NOTE:  The purpose of this amendment is to inform potential offerors of the extension of the solicitation to May 21, 2010, and to provide responses to new questions that have been presented by potential offerors.  This office is currently working on revisions to the solicitation.  Once completed, the revised solicitation package will be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) with the new offer due date and time of receipt.  

 
New questions from potential offerors:

1.  Did the Contracting Officer ever receive requests to conform specific positions that may not have been on the applicable wage determination as a result of any of the Department of Labor (DOL) Wage Determinations published over the life of the contract?  If so, what did that process involve?  If there were no requests received, it would be helpful to know that as well.

Government Answer:  The Contracting Officer never received any requests to conform specific positions that may not have been on the applicable Wage Determination as a result of any of the DOL Wage Determinations published over the life of the contract.


2.  With multiple hospitals having large numbers of position description that probably varied from those on the Wage Determination, how are decisions made about which positions, if any, need to go through the conformance process described by DOL?

Government Answer:  The conformance process described by DOL falls under 29 CFR 4.6 and 29 CFR 4.152.  According to DOL, if the positions or jobs are not on the Wage Determination, then the positions need to go through the conformance process.


3.  What happens when the actual hourly rate for a particular position of the Contractor is found to be below that of the comparable position on the Wage Determination.  Specifically, if the rate determined by DOL is based on a geographical area that is significantly different from the market area that a Contractor bases its wages on, what steps are available for a Contractor to justify the wage variance?

Government Answer:  According to DOL, whatever rate(s) is in the Wage Determination is the rate(s) as long as they classified it in the right geographical area for the particular contract.

<DESC>Integrated Evaluation of American Recovery and Reinvestment ACT (ARRA) Funding, Implementation and Outcomes
<p>The response to clarification question #20 and 25 has been revised as follows by the U.S Department of Education:</p>
<p><br />Question # 20 Attachment I, Small Business Subcontracting Plan states that in order to receive 20 points, the proposal must "subcontract work with a minimum or excess of 23% of the total contract dollars" to small businesses. It also states that the proposal must "subcontract work totaling at least 23% of the cost of the...contract" to small businesses. Does this mean 23% of the base contract amount, or 23% of the total cost of the base contract plus optional tasks?</p>
<p>Answer : The Department's policy regarding small business subcontracting is in flux. We have determined that for this procurement, in order to receive the extra 20 points, prime large businesses that choose to subcontract must ensure that a minimum of 37.5% of total subcontract dollars go to small businesses. This applies to both the base contract and the two options. Contractors that made arrangements in response to the Department's earlier clarification of questions (sent out April 29, 2010) should have no difficulty meeting this new goal. The Department encourages the prime contractor to enter into firm fixed price contracts with subcontractors.</p>
<p><br />Question # 25. Does the estimate of approximately 80 person years (Attachment K, p. 6) include the options? If not, is there an estimate of the number of person years for Options 1 and 2?</p>
<p>Answer: The estimate of approximately 80 person years does not include the options. If both options are exercised, it would add approximately 20 person years. See response 16 of addendum # 1.</p>

<SUBJECT>Improvement of the Accuracy of the Beta Dose Calculations in VARSKIN 3.1 Computer Code
<SOLNBR>RS-04-10-124
<RESPDATE>060410
<CONTACT>Michael Mills, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 492-362`, Fax (301) 492-3437, Email michael.mills@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a full and open competition for the project entitled "Improvement of the Accuracy of the Beta Dose Calculations in VARSKIN 3.1 Computer Code."
<p><br />The objective of this contract is to customize the computer code VARSKIN 3 and NUREG/CR-6918 for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The current version of VARSKIN 3 does not accurately predict beta dose from some radionuclides for iron slab and iron sphere. The accuracy of the code is decreasing with skin depth. In order to address the above issues, NRC seeks to replace the current beta model in VARSKIN 3 to give the code the ability to accurately model beta dosimetry resulting from contamination on the skin or on protective clothing covering the skin. The secondary objective is to further develop and expand the code's functionality and usefulness to address foreseeable user needs after the contract has been completed. The proposed contract will be for a 19 month period of performance.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available on May 6, 2010 and the closing date for proposals will be on June 4, 2010. The solicitation will be available solely through the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. The solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website. Therefore, interested parties are requested not to send letters, e-mails or faxes requesting copies of the RFP. Accordingly, telephone, mail, e-mail or fax requests will not be honored. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition. The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any costs associated with responding to this solicitation. The size standard for this acquisition is an average of $4.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS code 541330. Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small business, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The NRC encourages teaming arrangements utilizing FedBizOpps' Interested Vendors List (IVL) system, which will be enabled after the solicitation is issued.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Project Summary:<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Architecture and Engineering (A/E) Services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Scope of A/E services will include: civil and mechanical engineering design; scheduling; cost engineering; value engineering; administrative coordination and integration of the various disciplines involved; construction phase services and CAD record documentation. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The GSA Heating &amp; Operation Transmission District (HOTD) steam system is located in the downtown area of Washington, DC. The proposed project consists of the replacement of old and deteriorated underground main steam and condensate lines in the system that are the direct buried main steam and condensate return service lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It also includes other site work such as shoring, restoration of sidewalks, curbs and pavement, temporary lighting and temporary traffic controls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Replacing these lines will improve steam service reliability, and prevent future line ruptures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will also substantially improve overall system efficiency through better-insulated lines, and increased condensate return to the heating plant. This project follows a FY 2006 prospectus project (HOTD Upgrade I), which consisted of the replacement of individual building steam service and condensate return lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The first project, HOTD Upgrade I is replacing buried steam &amp; condensate service lines that run between the main lines and individual Steam Service Customer buildings. The second project, HOTD Upgrade II will replace the buried Steam &amp; Condensate Main Lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Buried Main Steam Service and Condensate Return Lines within the GSA-HOTD system are between 40 to 75 years old, well beyond their expected service life, causing a significant increase in repairs, poor reliability, lower energy efficiency and higher operation costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The majority of the HOTD Upgrade II work will be performed underground; the total estimated project cost ranges between $20M and $30M, which includes an unforeseen site conditions/design contingency to compensate for the inevitable risks associated with underground utility work. The steam system being upgraded is not proprietary; however, the new work will connect to existing equipment and with any future system equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

10. Primary POC: James Poe   James.poe@va.gov

11. Description:

In April 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) published Policy Letter 05-01, Developing and Managing the Acquisition Workforce, which requires the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to develop, and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council (CAOC) to approve, a certification program for contracting professionals in civilian agencies that reflects common standards. The goal of the certification program is to standardize the education, training, and experience requirements for contracting professionals, which will improve workforce competencies and increase career opportunities.

The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and the subsequent Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 05-01 (found at www.fai.gov ) require the heads of Federal agencies, through their Senior Procurement Executive, to define the education, training and experience necessary for career progression within the acquisition workforce job functions identified in table 1. This includes mandatory coursework and on-the-job training.  Under the current law, individuals in the occupational series GS-1102 and those possessing a contracting officer's warrant, regardless of their occupational series, are required to meet certain baseline training and education requirements based on their grade.  
VA is one of the largest consumers of commercially-acquired goods and services in the Federal Government.  In addition to the 1102 series, VA has expanded the definition of "acquisition workforce" to include: See Table 1.  The VAAA's mission is to develop competency-based training programs for the VA's acquisition workforce to ensure acquisition excellence within the agency.  See Attachment 1. 

Table 1- Acquisition Workforce Job Functions
Job Functions
Contract Specialists  					Construction and Facilities Management
Contracting Officer Technical Representative	Information Technology Specialists
Program Managers					Systems Engineers		
Logistics Management Specialists
 
For the past two years, the VA has been instructing classes for the acquisition workforce. Based on lessons learned, they are seeking contractors to provide support of the evaluation of the training program using the Kirkpatrick Evaluation Model and ROI. (These services will not be used to identify individuals or individual's data measure or job performance.) See Table 2. 

Table 2- Evaluation Training Program Support

The vendor will perform follow-up evaluations at 3, 6, and 9 month intervals.  The vendor will make contact with 100% of the students and supervisors.  The 3 month interval requires a minimum 50% response from the students and supervisors.  The 6 month interval requires a minimum 40% response from the students and supervisors.  The 9 month interval requires 25% response from the students and supervisors.  Deliverables: The vendor will deliver monthly reports that include an analysis of the data.

<DESC>This was an approve J & A 10-046 to procured brand name only, sole source Motorola parts and equipment base on the following rationale. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (c), the required support parts are peculiar to one manufacturer, Motorola.
There are over 20 U.S. Naval Bases using the ELMR System. The radio system is comprised of all Motorola components and only Motorola parts are compatible with the system, no substitutes.  SWFLANT, King Bay, under direct funding from Strategic System Programs has invested over $2,000,000.00 in the ELMR System.  No other generic radio parts are compatible with the Enterprise Land Mobile Radio System; they must be Motorola parts to ensure compatibility and inter-operability. In addition, a Firm-Fixed-Price maintenance contract number (DAAB07-01-D-H806/0261 dated 28Jun05) is already in place with Motorola, and non-Motorola parts are not covered under that contract. 
This acquisition is for a security communication, Enterprise Land Mobile Radio System to be provided by an authorized dealer for Motorola and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a) (4), the supplies are available from only one source in accordance with the agency's standardization program for specified makes and models of technical equipment and parts that will satisfy agency requirements for additional units or replacement items. 
The Commander Navy Installation Command provides direction, technical and operational oversight to lower-level commands using the Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (ELMR) instruction EL-000080 Revision 00, dated 11 November 2008.  The National Enterprise Land Mobile Radio program consists of implementing a P25 Land Mobile Radio (LMR) system to support the Navy's first responders. The ELMR System supports Navy Region Northwest (NRNW), Navy Region Southwest (NRSW), Navy Region Midwest (NRMW), Navy Region South (NRSO), Navy Region Southeast (NRSE), and Navy Region Mid-Atlantic (NRMA). The ELMR System will be adding new equipment to the NRSW, NRSO, NRMA, and NRMW, and reusing existing LMR equipment in NRNW and NRSE. The ELMR System will also provide Dispatch Sites, Network Management Sites, Key Management Sites, and Interoperability equipment.The six regions will be controlled by Zone Cores located in NRSW, NRNW, NRMW, and NRSE at the Network Switching Centers (NSC). The NSCs will be located at these facilities:. Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville, supporting NRSE and NRSO. Naval Support Activity (NSA) Crane, supporting NRMA and NRMW. Naval Base (NB) Pt. Loma, supporting NRSW. NB Kitsap - Bangor, supporting NRNWAdditionally, ELMR will also support two National Dispatch Centers (NDC) located at these facilities:. NB San Diego. NAS JacksonvilleDispatch, Network/System Management and Key Management will be located at the two NDCs. Each of the centers will be fully capable of assuming the duties of the other as required. Each Navy facility supported by ELMR will also have local dispatch equipment and interoperability equipment. This equipment will be used to support local operations and provide communications between the ELMR System and local agencies.
The Government's needs are highly specific and no other manufacturer in the commercial marketplace fabricates a series of end products geared specifically for our requirements related to SWFLANT Security mission, taking into account the requirements of DoD 5210.41M and OPNAVINST3000.12A Operational Availability Handbook defines Availability (Ao) as "the probability that the system will be ready to perform its specified function, in its specified and intended operational environment, when called for at a random point in time". Ao is usually expressed as a percentage and is defined as total time / up time. Subsystem Ao for the Land Mobile Radio (LMR) subsystem is based on historical data gathered from NRNW. The historical data includes all failures. It includes failures that are excluded by the ELMR Statement of Work.  Based on the historical data provided, the LMR subsystem has an Ao of 0.99952979. The government relies on this particular system because of its Availability, Interoperability, and reliability.
It is imperative that support continues without interruptions inasmuch as the lack of support or discontinuance of services would have a significant impact on the Enterprise Land Mobile Radio System supporting the U.S. Navy's Strategic mission.

<AWDNBR>Not-yet-awarded
<DESC><p>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS), Office of Systems Development, Ground Systems Division intends to negotiate with Real Time Logic, Inc. on a sole-source basis for acquiring highly specialized services to implement and integrate the built-in bit synchronizer functionality as well as additional operations enhancements of RT Logic T400 receivers installed at NOAA Command and Data Acquisition Stations (CDAS) located at Wallops, VA and Fairbanks, AK. Engineering and development are required from the receiver manufacturer to modify the current receivers installed. The firmware and software of the receivers are intellectual property owned by RT Logic, Inc. Recently the initial receivers were successfully installed replacing outdated receivers. The newly installed receivers are based on new digital technology which was a departure from the old analog receivers. An additional twenty-five receivers will be acquired under this acquisition, now that the full capabilities of the new digital receivers in an operational environment have been achieved to support 5-meter Polar Antenna operations. Fifteen additional T400 units are needed to enhance the capability to support command uplink, simulation of the polar mission data, and provide for sufficient sparing. Spare units will be distributed to both CDAS and will be used to compliment the NOAA Polar Acquisition System satellite ground system which supports critical operations that collect weather satellite data from NOAA missions. In addition to the acquisition of 40 T400 units, installation and integration, and maintenance will be provided for an additional four years after warranty. In addition to supporting NOAA primary Polar missions, the NPAS satellite ground system also supports the Initial Joint Polar System (IJPS) which operates jointly between NOAA and EUMETSAT under an international agreement (signed November 19, 1998) and the Ocean Surface Topography Mission (OSTM) as part of an international agreement between NOAA, NASA, CNES, and EUMETSAT (signed April 7, 2006) using the same RT Logic receiver/combiner. Any failure of the NPAS ground system could impact both the IJPS, and Jason-2 missions which would put NOAA at risk of not being able to fulfill the terms of their international agreements. Failure to receive data affects weather forecasting and may have economic and social consequences. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide products/services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

5.	Rationale in support of citation in Paragraph 4 above:

    a. Description of contractor and or of acquisition action that demonstrates that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:  The service provided by Stryker Medical_ requires expert knowledge of the highly complex Stryker Go-Beds and their technicians have received factory sponsored training that is exclusive to their employees.  Stryker Medical is the sole source provider for repair parts and service on their bed and stretcher products in the Little Rock market.  Stryker sells direct to hospitals and emergency healthcare facilities.

8.  Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition:

    a. Explanation of why technical data, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full open and competition have not been developed or are not available:  Statement of work has been developed, however, the following acquisition has not been issued.  The 2 month extension will allow time for the solicitation to issued and potential sources to submit offers.   

    b. When the sole source exception is used in the case of a follow-on acquisition, provide an estimate of the cost that would be duplicated and describe how the estimate was derived if the contract is awarded to other than the incumbent:  N/A

    c. When the urgency exception is cited provide the data, estimate of cost or other rationale as to the extent of harm to the government if the contract is not awarded expediently:  N/A

9.  Sources expressing an interest:  Only One Responsible Source - Due to the in-depth knowledge of the Stryker Go-Beds and the fact that Stryker Medical is the only company in the Little Rock market certified by the manufacturer to provide service and parts for Stryker beds and stretcher products.

10. Actions, if any, being taken to remove barriers to full and open competition:   
      No efforts are available because of unique qualifications of the source. 

11. Delivery Requirements:  Electronic subscription for an on-line internet based training service for a 1-year period of performance.  

12.  Acquisition Plan: An Acquisition Plan   (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition.
