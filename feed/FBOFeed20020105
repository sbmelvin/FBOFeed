<DESC>, Qty 1, Deliver to Defense Distribution Depot (sb3106) Norfolk VA , RFQ N00383XXXXXX, Approx Due Date O/A Apr 15                        02--This notice is for information and planning purposes                         only and does not  constitute an RFP or commitment by the                        government. NAVICP anticipates possible  solicitation for                        Contractor to manage a Performaced Based Logistics (PBL)                         Program in support of the F14 and EA6B Hydraulic Systems.                        Under PBL, a Contractor will manage all logistics functions                      of the hydraulic systems while  primarily being responsible                      for meeting daily fleet demand requirements,  efficiently                        and economically, within a prescibed 48 hour time period to                      conus  destinations. The method to support demand                                requirements through production or  repair is the                                Contractor's decision. Support through repair anticipates                        utilization and management of a repair facility that must                        be approved by the Navy for the required hydraulic repairs.                      A partnership arrangement with the  current naval hydraulics                     repair facility will be considered. Developement and                             management of any repair process requires maintaining DOD                        "core" obligations. Additional PBL responsibilities are                          inventory management including  warehousing, configuration                       management, requisition processing through EDI,                                  transportation, training and maintaing reliability. Any                          resultant performance contract would be anticipated to be                        for a five year base period with one or  two five-year                           option period(s). Interested sources should contact                              NAVICPfor  further information including possible                                pre-solicitation conference. Questions  relative to this                         notice may be directed to either the Contracting Officer,                        Gene Stumpo, code 0231.05 at 215-697-5980 or to the                              Technical Manager, George Ball, code 0315.1 at                                   215-697-4082.
