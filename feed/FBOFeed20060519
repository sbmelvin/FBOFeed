The GPO is seeking a contractor to assist FRTIB staff in conducting (development, delivery, and analysis of) a survey of Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) participants.

The contractor should have extensive experience conducting surveys of participants in employee benefit plans.

It is contemplated that a fixed-price contract will be awarded for this effort.  Estimated release date for the solicitation is on or about June 6, 2006.  GPO seeks to have the survey process completed and final report delivered no later October 31, 2006.  

Electronic copies of the RFP and any other documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Requests for paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>R -- Closed Captioning of the televised U.S. House of Representatives floor proceedings
<SOLNBR>CLK06000187

<DESC>The U.S. House of Representatives requires the services of a qualified Contractor to provide full scale, real-time
verbatim closed-captioning of the televised House floor proceedings for individuals who are hearing impaired. 

The Offeror shall provide the manpower, materials and equipment to provide closed-captioning service for the House in accordance 
with the Section C work requirements.  At the commencement of the contract period and continuing throughout the term of the 
contract, the Offeror shall provide 98.6% accuracy of verbatim captioning at the average rate between 225 to 250 words per minute for live broadcast.  The Offeror will be required to provide the services gavel-to-gavel for each daily session of the House.  
Closed-captioning services for broadcast on each calendar day in which the House is in session shall be created from an audio-only 
feed of House floor proceedings provided by the House Recording Studio and transmitted to Offeror via modem..  It is estimated that up to, but not limited to, 1,200 hours of captioning will be required for each 12-month period.  Distribution of these hours over the calendar year will be variable and generally, unpredictable.  At a minimum, captioning services will commence at the beginning of each calendar day on which the House is in session and end when that day's session is adjourned.  The target population to be served by this service consists of persons with hearing impairments (and who are unable to receive or understand the audio portion of a television program with or without amplification) and persons learning English.

This contract is a firm, fixed-price (FFP) type contract.  The contract will have an initial base period of three (3) years  (01/01/2007 through 12/30/2009) with three (3) annual renewable options thereafter.  Preliminary written notice to the Contractor of the House's intention to exercise these options will be at least 90 days before the contract expires.  The preliminary notice does not commit the House to an extension.  The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause shall not exceed six (6) years.  Unless otherwise provided by statute, the House is exempt from all taxes, including any sales and use taxes.

The successful Offeror shall provide the necessary personnel, material and equipment to provide verbatim closed-captioning services of the televised floor proceedings of the U.S. House of Representatives (House) at the start of each daily session and ending at time of adjournment.


At the commencement of the contract period, the Offeror will be ready to perform full scale, gavel-to-gavel, real-time verbatim closed captioning for broadcast of the House televised floor proceedings with the convening of the next daily session of the House and will continue such service with each successive daily session of the House through the contract performance period.  The services will start upon the opening of each session on each calendar day in which the House is in session, and end upon the adjournment of the day's session.  The Offeror will provide closed-captioning on a real-time basis from an audio-only feed of House floor proceedings provided by the House Recording Studio and transmitted to Offeror via telephone.  Captions will be transmitted via modem to the House Recording Studio 
in the form of a data string.  The cost of transmission will be borne by the Offeror.  

The incumbent Contractor receives televised coverage (audio and video) while the House is in session via telecast on the C-SPAN
network.  The incumbent Contractor receives this audio and video signal independent of the House, and this C-SPAN coverage is 
not a requirement of the current contract.  The incumbent Contractor does not rely on a local cable affiliate to provide this C-SPAN telecast, but monitors both the nationally distributed satellite feed and the local cable affiliate to assure uninterrupted, high quality reception.  

Additionally, the incumbent Contractor receives the main, audio-only feed directly from the House Recording Studio via telephone.  This audio-only transmission is necessitated due to instances when C-SPAN opts not to broadcast all floor activities while the House is in session, or in the event that the incumbent Contractor suffers a temporary loss of their independent C-SPAN feed.   
The incumbent Contractor, in turn, encodes the audio portion of the floor activities and returns the signal, in the form of a data string, exclusively to the House Recording Studio via modem.  The House Recording Studio then splits and transfers the data feed to the House's two insertion devices (EN-470-D1 Smart Encoder III).  The two encoders add the data as captions to the House's internal broadcast and to the C-SPAN television signal.  

In accordance with this service, the incumbent Contractor will only transmit captions or the recording thereof, to the House, and will monitor and verify the captions/signals via the C-SPAN Television Network to ensure that they are being fed properly to the House.  
Therefore, the prospective Offerors responding to this RFP must ensure that equipment used to close-caption the House floor 
proceedings is capable of receiving and/or transmitting signals that are compatible with Model EN-470-D1, Smart Encoder III, and are encouraged to follow the same or similiar process (as the incumbent Contractor) to maintain the integrity of the system.  The Smart Encoder III, Model EN-470-D1, is manufactured by EEG Enterprises, Inc., 586 Main Street, Farmingdale, NY 11735.  
Section J - Appendix C includes the data input characteristics of Model EN-470-D1, Smart Encoder III.  The House will utilize 
current industry standards.  In the event the Smart Encoder is replaced or upgraded with a new one, the successful Offeror awarded a contract under this RFP shall ensure that equipment used to close-caption the House floor is compatible with any new unit.  

The accuracy of closed-captioning services provided under this contract will be the sole responsibility of the Offeror.  During the term of this agreement, the Offeror will maintain the level of accuracy of closed-captioning services provided under this contract at not less than 98.6 percent accuracy at the average rate of 225 to 250 words per minute.  Failure to comply with this standard may be grounds for liquidated damages and/or termination.  The Offeror will be responsible for responding in a timely manner to complaints or other notices or advice regarding inaccuracies in closed-captioning.  The Offeror will coordinate any such response to a House office through the Contracting Officer.
The Offeror shall provide verbatim closed-captioning services from a site exclusive from the U.S. Capitol Grounds, including the
U.S. Capitol Building and the buildings of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.

The Offeror shall submit six (6) copies, one (1) original, and one (1) electronic version in MS Word format of their proposal in response to this RFP by Tuesday, July 11, 2006, at 2:00 PM EDT.  The original shall be so marked, and the copies shall be numbered.  Proposal packages shall be sealed in a suitable container, and all containers shall clearly identify firm name and address and RFP Number.  The electronic version, in MS Word format, shall be submitted to v.anne.tugbang@mail.house.gov by Tuesday, July 11, 2006 at 2:00 PM.  All written communications should clearly indicate the RFP designation of: "CLK06000187". 

Schedule for the Bidding Process and Captioning Transmission Test: 

a.	Question and Answer Schedule.  The Offeror may submit questions in writing via email to the Contract Administrator identified above by 12:00 (noon) EDT Tuesday, June 13, 2006.  

b. 	Pre-Proposal Conference. The House will host a pre-proposal conference on Friday, June 9, 2006.   Each attendee will be required to sign an Affirmation of Non-Disclosure (see Section J - Appendix A) .  The House will provide a detailed walk through of the RFP and will host a question and answer session.

Due to security requirements, the Offeror will only be permitted three (3) attendees for the pre-proposal conference. Attendees must be registered with the Contract Administrator in the Office of the Clerk by 12:00 (noon) PM EDT, Wednesday, June 7, 2006.  Register via phone at (202) 225-7000 or by e-mail: v.anne.tugbang@mail.house.gov.     

c.	As part of the bidding process, all Offerors will be required to perform a remote, live caption transmission test.  The House Recording Studio will transmit a two-hour audio-only broadcast of House proceedings to the Offeror via phone line.  The Offeror will produce live closed-captions and will transmit the captions in the form of a data string to the House Recording Studio for encoding and recording.  Offerors should produce captions using the method and technology proposed in their proposal, to include multiple captioners, same or similar equipment, and backup technology.  The recorded results will be evaluated for accuracy of captions, continuity and consistency of captions as between multiple captioners, and compatibility of transmission modalities.

The content of the audio-only broadcast will be a recording of actual House floor proceedings with multiple speakers.

Date and time for testing will be established by the Contracts Administrator, in communication with the Offeror.  
Questions regarding test setup and execution must be submitted by June 15, 2006.

This live caption transmission test is very important and will be weighed at 30 percent of the evaluation process towards the ultimate award of this contract.  An Offeror unwilling or unable to successfully participate in this testing procedure will be deem ineligible for contract award.

<DESC>Congressional Research Service
					        Statement of Work  for
					 Graphic Design Support Contract 


A.	BACKGROUND 


	The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is the public policy research arm of the United States Congress.  As a legislative branch agency within the Library of Congress, CRS works exclusively and directly for Members of Congress, their Committees and staff on confidential, nonpartisan basis.  The CRS staff comprises nationally recognized experts in a range of issues and disciplines, including law, economics, foreign affairs, public administration, social, political sciences, and natural sciences. 

	Congress created CRS to serve its needs for nonpartisan and objective research and analysis of  legislative policy issues.  CRS provides timely, confidential, and authoritative research and analysis to Members, committees, and their staff.  CRS provides comprehensive support in foreign policy, economics, law, science, political science, and social policy.  CRS also covers the operations and procedures of both Chambers, legislative processes for the Federal budget and appropriations, and all constitutional issues including separation of powers, war powers, impeachment, and electoral procedures.

	CRS analysts, attorneys, and information specialists work closely with Members and committees to explain policy problems, develop options and legislative proposals, conduct legal analysis of pending legislation, deliver testimony before congressional committees, prepare products on current legislative issues, write confidential memoranda, and provide personal consultations.  CRS  also conducts seminars on public policy and legal issues as well as training in the legislative and budget processes.

	CRS has a requirement for the design of several CRS products on a continuing basis.  The objective is to create or update materials using the existing CRS logo design and previously developed design themes and standards so that they have a consistent look with existing materials and are engaging to congressional and CRS audiences. 

B.	SCOPE OF WORK 

	CRS has been working on building a visual awareness with designs that are engaging, understated and elegant. This program is being administered by the Associate Director for Congressional Affairs and Counselor to the Director of the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. 

	Our clients, congressional staff, have a high turn over rate compared to other industries.  In addition, they receive vast amounts of information daily and our products need designs that are both engaging and easily recognizable as a CRS product.

	The objective of this contract is to create or update materials using the existing CRS logo design and previously developed design themes and standards (i.e. color palette and design elements) so that they have a consistent look with existing materials and are engaging to congressional and CRS audiences. 

C.  	REQUIREMENTS 

	There are four requirements.
	
	C1. 	The contractor or their representative must be in the local area (within 35 miles of the Library of Congress) and within the Library of Congress’s messenger service area. 

	C2. 	Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment and facilities needed to produce the deliverables outlined in this contract.

	C3. 	All final art work in digital form will be prepared on a Macintosh computer with a writable CD-Rom drive, using the listed version or higher of the following programs: Adobe Illustrator CS2, InDesign CS2, Photoshop CS2, Acrobat 6.0 and Quark Express 6.5. 

	C4. 	The contractor must have Adobe Caslon and Univers fonts.  Other supplies or expenses such as internal or external color proofs and comps, CDs or zip disks, local transportation, messenger service, overnight mail and copies are to be included as part of the contract cost. 

D.  	PROCESS

	The seven part process for each deliverable is as follows:

	D1.	At the start of each project, the contractor will discuss the design options with CRS representatives (either at a meeting or a conference call decided by CRS).  Contractor representatives must include a principal of the firm or the proposed designer (this may be same person). Contractor shall be given a minimum of four day’s notice of initial meeting or conference call and three days’ notice for an additional meeting or conference call, at the option of the Library.

	D2.	Contractor will provide a detailed design and production schedule for each project.  For at least one project but no more than three projects during the contract, last minute design changes will have to be made due to changes in the congressional schedule. 

	D3.	There will be at least four rounds of CRS review with CRS comments and changes incorporated into each round.  Included in the rounds of review are the initial creative concepts and layout reviews as follows:

			&#9679;	submission of three initial creative concepts with folding paper comps as appropriate, accompanied by PMS chips and recommended paper samples
			&#9679;	revision of creative concepts
			&#9679;	2 to 3 rounds of layout review and revisions.

	D4.	All text for designs will either be given to the contractor/designer in WordPerfect format or in the text of an email, or via fax.

	D5.	Photography, when used, will be a combination of CRS supplied photos, stock photos, and new photography from contractor/designer managed photo shoots.


	D6.	 The contractor/designer will prepare a final release printing package.  It will include two copies of each of the following: 

			&#9679;	GPO form 952 including printing specifications and file list
			&#9679;	hard copy markups with screen percentages marked (not color separations) and folding comps
			&#9679;	paper samples and
			&#9679;	files on a CD.

	D7.	The contractor/designer will conduct press checks on each item unless waived by CRS. The contractor must be available to attend press checks within 24 to 48 hours notice.

E. 	DELIVERABLES 

	The contract will consist of the following 6 projects: 
	
	E1.	Guide Brochure.  Condense existing 6 page design to 4 pages and update text.  Equivalent of 1 page of new text in a 4 page brochure.
	
	E2.	CRS Services.  This is a single page flier, two-sided, 8 ½  x 11 inch sheet designed in 2 colors.  It may include screen shots from our Web site.  There is a current design but since the focus of the text is changing, it is unclear how much of the current design will be retained.

	E3.	CRS Rolodex Cards.  Update.  This is a set of 2 rolodex cards.
	
	E4.	District/State Staff Institutes.   Design a look for this training program and then transfer the design to the components.  The three components might include a notebook cover, spine, and letterhead. All of these are 8 ½  x 11 inches with the exception of the spine which is 2 ½ inches wide.
	
	E5. 	Intern Training.  Design a look for interns and then transfer the design to the components.  The 4 components might include a folder, booklet cover, card, and letterhead. The folder holds 8 ½  x 11 inch items, the booklet and letterhead are 8 ½  x 11 inches and the card is 4 1/4 x 3 ½ inches.
	
	E6.	Reprint Press Check.  This is a press check on a previous design that is being reprinted.  The printer is within a 50 mile radius of the Metropolitan DC area.

	The Library of Congress reserves the right not to create or update any of the deliverables listed in this contract.  The Library reserves the right  to create or update other items not listed in this contract. 



F. 	KEY PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS 

	A principal of the company must be at all meetings or conference calls.  If contact is mostly through the designer, then the proposed designer must also be present. This may be the same person if the proposed designer is also a principal of the company.

	If one or more of the key personnel becomes, or is expected to become, unavailable for work under this contract such that it would substantially affect the final delivery date of any one item, the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and, subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative, promptly replace such personnel with personnel of at least substantially equal qualifications.

	All requests for approval of substitutions hereunder must be in writing and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitutions.  They must contain a complete resume for the proposed substitute and any other information requested by the Contracting Officer to approve or disapprove the proposed substitution.  The Contracting Officer or  authorized representative will evaluate such requests and promptly notify the contractor of her approval or disapproval thereof in writing.

	If  the Contracting Officer determines the suitability and timely replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated or have otherwise become unavailable for the contract work is not reasonably forthcoming or that the resultant reduction of productive effort would be so substantial as to impair the successful completion of the contract or the services ordered, the contract may be terminated by the Contracting Officer for default or for the convenience of the Government, as appropriate, or, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer if he/she finds the contractor at fault for the condition, the contract price may be equitably adjusted downward to compensate the Government for any resultant delay, loss or damage.

G.    EVALUATION CRITERIA

        	           The contract award will be made on a “Best Value” basis to that offeror whose combination of technical and price quotations is the most advantageous, and which is within the available Library of Congress resources.  Offerors must submit written proposals.  The evaluation factors are:

         Factor 1. Qualifications/Experience of Key Personnel
         Factor 2. Previously Demonstrated Experience and Successful Past Performance
         Factor 3. Samples
         Factor 4. References
     
         Factor 1.  Qualifications/Experience of Key Personnel.  The offeror shall identify and provide a resume for the principal of the firm to be centrally involved with the contract from its inception through completion.  Offeror shall identify proposed designer(s) and shall provide a detailed resume which indicates experience relevant to work on this project.  For each proposed team member, offeror must state the level of skill, proposed role on project, employment status, and time commitment to this project.  Each proposed team member must have at least ten (10) years professional design experience.

	              Factor 2.   Previously Demonstrated Experience and Successful Past Performance.  Offeror shall provide information to address the following three sections: 

 	                 Factor 2, Section 1.   Design Consistency.  The offeror shall provide project descriptions for similar efforts which demonstrate its work where a logo design and some pieces have already been designed and the offeror designs follow on or additional pieces.  The descriptions must include the scope of work, level of staffing, duration, and why the project is considered relevant to these requirements.

        	                 Factor 2, Section 2.   Congressional Audience.  The offeror shall provide a list of projects and short descriptions for each project where its designs targeted a congressional audience, either Members of Congress or congressional staff. If the offeror has not designed any projects targeting a congressional audience,  describe other projects where the relationship between your client and the audience is similar to CRS’ relationship to Congress including why the relationship is similar.

	         Factor 2, Section 3.  Printing.  The offeror shall provide a list of projects and short descriptions for each project during the past three years which demonstrate its ability to coordinate the printing process with the Library of Congress Print Management Group and/or the Government Printing Office.   The descriptions must identify whether the offeror attended the press inspection.  If the offeror has not coordinated any printing with the Library of Congress Print Management Group and/or the Government Printing Office,  the offeror may provide a written description of their general knowledge of printing process and work with printers.  This could include advice given about cost effective ways to achieve print outcome, attendance at press checks, and work with printers in the metropolitan Washington DC area.

            Factor 3. Samples.   Offeror shall provide samples to demonstrate the following four criteria.  The samples should be marked as to which criteria they represent. 

	                    Factor 3, Section 1.  Design Consistency.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a notice of a contract action. The Aging Aircraft Program Office  (ASC/AAA)is contemplating the issuance of Sole Source Contracts with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation Integrated Systems/Air Combat Systems RG00/W6 One Hornet Way El Segundo, CA 90245-2804 Lockheed Martin Corporation				 5600 Sand Lake Road, MP 615				 Orlando, FL 32819					 Raytheon Company Raytheon Missile Systems TU/M09/3 1151 E. Hermans Road Tucson, AZ 85706 The Boeing Company					 P.O. Box 516						 Mailcode:  S270-3804					 St. Louis, MO 63166-0516	 Background: This current effort is part of an ongoing UAI effort. The Universal  Armament Interface (UAI) Program, Phase II objective is the development and  proofing of a Common Interface Control Document (CICD) by Original Equipment  Manufactures (OEMs) for implementation by the aircraft platform program offices  which will enable the decoupling of aircraft weapons integration from cyclical  aircraft operational flight program (OFP) updates.  The UAI CICD will  standardize applicable -1553 message sets and associated functional interfaces  and will include new common message definition and provisional growth  messages.  Aircraft programs will implement the established CICD in their OFP.   Weapon programs will conform with the CICD if a new weapon is being integrated;  however, legacy weapons having established interfaces will continue to use  messages/functions embedded in their existing ICDs, making the conversion to  the CICD when appropriate.  Requirements:   Contractor teams will define a protocol for achieving rapid, low cost  integration of weapons onto aircraft by decoupling the integration from the  aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) update cycles.   A phase approach is planned for developing and implementing UAI across the Air  Force's and potentially other Services' weapon and platform inventories.  The  current planned approach is as follows: Phase II: MIL-STD-1760 class of Air-to-Ground weapons [Current] Technical Objectives are further defined in the attached RFP. Each bidder needs  to respond and address all sections of the RFP in their proposal response. Acquisition Environment: The statutory authority, which  permits other than full and open competition for this  acquisition is 10 United States Code (USC) 2304 (c)(1), as  implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii) Only one responsible  source or limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or  services will satisfy  agency requirements.  Proposal responses should be directed to the following: Ms. Marciana  Bain, (937) 255-3385 ext. 3110, or Mr. Lawrence Doelker, (937) 255-3385  ext. 3810; ASC/LPKC, Bldg 28, 2145 Monahan Way, Wright  Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7017.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Panama City, Florida intends to procure seafloor habitat delineation services potentially in the U.S. South Atlantic between Cape Hatteras, NC and the Florida Keys; the Gulf of Mexico between Brownsville, TX and the Florida Keys; and the U.S. Caribbean (Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands).  The depths will range between 40 and 250m, but will be concentrated between 70 and 120m.  

NOAA Fisheries is tasked with providing information on fish and invertebrate species as well as critical habitat to federal management entities including Fishery Management Councils (FMCs).  In the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. South Atlantic, many of the areas containing the species and habitat of interest lie in deep water at the edge of the continental shelf.  The depths preclude in situ observations, thus Fisheries must rely upon remote sensing technologies.  In the U.S. South Atlantic alone, there are needs to survey ~1000 sq nautical miles of shelf edge habitat between north Florida and North Carolina.  The contract will be for the collection and processing of multibeam bathymetric and acoustic backscatter data at depths identified herein.  The Contractor shall provide all items necessary to perform the services described herein, which shall include but are not limited to: a suitable vessel platform, equipment, tools, supplies, hardware, software, labor, professional expertise, travel expenses for personnel, etc.    The Contractor’s survey equipment must be matched to the depth range in order to provide the highest possible resolution.  A depth range and coordinates will be provided for specific Task Orders.  Deliverables under this contract may include:  Raw data files in either *.all format or .*xtf format, for acoustic seabed classification with QTC multiview; XYZ and XYA data corrected for heave, pitch roll, yaw and tides; ArcInfo GRID of bathymetry and backscatter to be imported into ArcGIS 9.1; Geotiff images of bathymetry and backscatter; and complete metadata.  Additional related requirements may be included in subsequent Task Orders.  Data must be delivered in DVD format.

The Government intends to award one or more Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract (s) under FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR 15 (Contracting By Negotiation) with each contract having a term of 5 years.  Each contract shall have a minimum value of $100,000.  The IDIQ will identify base rates to be charged for performing seafloor habitat delineation services as projects and funding become available for which Task Orders will be issued.    

This is a full and open competition solicitation.  The Government plans to post a solicitation on or about June 12, 2006 with proposals due approximately 20 calendar days thereafter.  The NAICS code is 541360 and the small business size standard is a maximum $4.5M.

The device shall be capable of simultaneously acquiring and logging digital data whose values represent the following physiological signals:  dermal surface temperature, core body temperature, ambient temperature, and heart rate. The device is to be used to monitor worker’s physiological changes in a variety of industrial and non-industrial environments to determine heat strain, when work should stop, and effectiveness of control technologies.  In order to determine these changes, simultaneous/synchronized data for all of the physiological signals is statistically analyzed to compare to occupational exposure criteria and to look for trends and correlations. In addition, the device shall be used to monitor individuals during emergency response situations.  In order to protect these individuals, the device shall be capable of displaying surface dermal temperature in real time as this measurement is used to determine when work should stop (when using encapsulating suits).  Firms that believe they can provide equipment with comparable functionality should identify themselves and give written product information, and address the equipment’s capabilities.  This information must be submitted to the contracting officer within 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis.  Reference #000HCC52-2006-32473.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>062706
<CONTACT>April Irby at 850-636-6035, or Contracting Officer Mark Ross at 850-235-5624.
<DESC>The original synopsis issued on or about 13 Mar 06 has been revised as outlined below: The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to award a sole source indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity contract to EDO Corporation of New York City, NY for engineering support services to modify a government-furnished neutralizer, integrate it onto a small craft, and develop a portable control console.  This effort will support Test and Evaluation, Requirements Development, and Tactics Development for a Very Shallow Water Mine Neutralization (VSW-MN) capability.  One of the goals of this DACP is to utilize the knowledge gained in the DACP and apply it to the Navy common neutralizer, currently employed by the AMNS and EMNS programs, to satisfy the requirements for the neutralization task in the VSW zone, provided the common neutralizer can satisfy requirements for the neutralization task in the VSW zone.  The period of performance for this DACP effort will be for five years from the date of award.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons:  This effort is being initiated based on a Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP) proposal from EDO, submitted to the DoD Comparative Testing Office (CTO) under Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) HQ0034-06-BAA-0001-DAC.  The U.S. Navy has evaluated the proposal and determined that it provides valuable information, which will support a future acquisition program for VSW neutralization, and therefore has merit for funding.  EDO is the U.S. original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the AN/ASQ-232 MNS, which is available now to support the early development effort in this DACP proposal.  The basic components of the initial prototype system, the SEAFOX neutralizer vehicle and the console, were originally developed by the German firm ATLAS ELEKTONIK (ATLAS) as a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin Corporation under NAVSEA contract N00024-99-9-6311, as a Rapid Deployment Capability (RDC).  As de!  monstrated by ATLAS ELEKTRONIC letter of 20 September 2005, ATLAS has negotiated an exclusive agreement with EDO to provide the essential customer interface, liaison and support to transition ATLAS technologies through subcontracts and licensing agreements. The intent of this effort is to validate the capability of small fiber-optically tethered torpedo systems to prosecute mines successfully in the dynamic, underwater VSW environment.  The effort will produce a portable control console, launcher and fiber management system operable from a small inflatable craft as an incremental capability to neutralize VSW mines without sole reliance on divers for mission accomplishment.  Demonstration with the common neutralizer will also be examined, as soon as it is available within the scope of this initiative. EDO is currently the only source in the U.S. that can provide direct access to those AN/ASQ-232 technologies required to successfully evaluate an initial VSW-MN capability within the DACP timeline.  EDO is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering support to accomplish all initial tasking, within the DACP timeline.  In su!  mmary, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant schedule risk to the US Government. Award will be made based on responsive quote on or about 20 July 06. NAICS 541330, SBA Size Standard: $4M, FSC: AZ14

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH SPECIAL NOTICE: Proposed contract N62467-06-R-9158, Replace Switching Station #1 at Central Energy Plant (PI0708M), Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, South Carolina, listed herein is being considered for 100% 8(a), HUBZone or SDVOSB Set-Aside.  All interested 8(a), HUBZone or SDVOSB concerns will notify this office via email of their intention to submit a proposal on the proposed contract as Prime no later than 5 June 2006.  NOTE:  8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB firms:  This notification/submittal MUST include (1) Name, address, and small business size status of the firm; (2) past performance references; evidence of contracts of similar size and complexity, qualifications (construction costs between $500,000 and $1,000,000); The project information shall include, at a minimum, the following information:  (i) the contract name or number, completion date of the project, and the total cost of the project; (ii) the names and telephone numbers of the facility or installation for whom the work was performed; (iii) the name and telephone number of a supervisory level point of contact at each facility or installation who has knowledge of the performance of the entity or entities.

If adequate interest is not received from 8(a), HUBZone or SDVOSB concerns, then the requirement will be issued unrestricted.  In addition, if adequate interest is received from 8(a) HUB Zone or SDVOSB concerns, it is the Contracting Officer's determination on how the project will be set-aside in accordance with applicable procedures.

This project will replace the existing 1959 vintage 15 kV three phase switching station #1 with modern 15 kV switchgear in a protective enclosure.  The new switching station switchgear lineup will consist of three circuit breakers for circuits B, C, and D with one spare circuit breaker and one spare space for future growth.  The enclosure will protect the equipment from exposure to the salt water/air and protect maintenance personnel when performing circuit breaker maintenance and troubleshooting procedures.  The new 15 kV circuit breakers will have microprocessor controlled protective relaying functions to properly coordinate the power distribution system at this location.  There will be a SCADA-type control system provided to control the functions of the circuit breakers and protective relaying for this switching station.  The control station will be located at the control room of Building 160.  There will be pole line work associated with installation of the new switching station to re-connect the existing circuits fed from the switchgear and to allow circuits to be bypassed during switchgear maintenance procedures.  The new switching station enclosure will be raised to above current flood elevations in that area (13.25 feet above sea level) by construction of a masonry platform with stairway access.  The new elevation of the switchgear will be 14.25 feet above sea level.  The existing truck access for the fuel tanks in this area will be re-graded and repaired to allow access around the new switching station.  Grass sod will be placed in the disturbed area around the new switching station to prevent erosion in this area.  NAICS is 237130:  POWER AND COMMUNICATION LINE AND RELATED STRUCTURES CONSTRUCTION with a size standard of $31 million.  All interested 8(a) Set-aside, HUBZone and SDVOSB concerns will notify this office via email at jodeen.cuffe@navy.mil no later than 5 June 2006.  YOUR RESPONSE MUST include the requirements (1) through (3) listed herein.   TELEPHONE NUMBER CITED FOR JODEEN CUFFE IS CHANGED TO READ 843-228-8563.

<CONTACT>Bethany Mills, Contract Specialist, Phone 720-544-2826, Fax 720-544-2962, Email bethany.mills@co.usda.gov
<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Colorado requires the services of an appraiser for the performance of technical reviews and possibly appraisal services in the acquisitions of easements under the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP), Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (FRPP).  This announcement is for potential sources of qualified technical review appraisers.  Qualified persons responding to this announcement will also be used in our pool of real property appraisers.  

All technical appraisal reviews completed for this program shall comply with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA a/k/a “Yellow Book”) and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.    

UASFLA and USPAP Conflicts:  Conflicts between UASFLA and USPAP are minimal.  When there is conflict, UASFLA takes precedence.  It may be necessary to invoke the Jurisdictional Exception Rule to USPAP to meet certain standards of the UASFLA.  Invocation of the Jurisdictional Exception Rule should never be invoked lightly and must include citation of the over-riding Federal policy, rule, or regulation that requires it.  

PROJECT INFORMATION:

NRCS anticipates needing approximately ten (10) technical reviews on easement acquisitions in the state of Colorado during the remainder of 2006.  

TECHNICAL REVIEW APPRAISER QUALIFICATIONS

Technical review appraisers under this program shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser in conformance with Title XI of the Financial Institution’s Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued.  The review appraiser must have demonstrated competency in compliance with USPAP in conducting and reviewing appraisals of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.  The review appraiser must provide documentation of appraisal education courses attended such as eminent domain or conservation easements, UASFLA course and at least 40 classroom hours of training in performing technical appraisal reviews to the authorized official.  

PURPOSE OF THE TECHNICAL APPRAISAL REPORTS

The purpose of the technical appraisal review is to provide an opinion of the acceptability of the appraisals that provide a market value of the whole subject property (larger parcel) before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the entire subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value, minus any adjustments for excess irrigation water to arrive at the effect on value of the easement.  The appraisals, technical review(s) and technical review report(s) must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS.

The purpose of two opinions of value is to establish the effect on value resulting from imposition of a conservation easement.  A key concept in this appraisal process is defining the larger parcel which is required to begin the appraisal process.  

The market value definition that will be stated and used in developing and reporting this assignment is the definition as stated in UASFLA which is, “Market value is the amount in cash, or in terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which in all probability the property would have sold on the effective date of the appraisal, after a reasonable exposure time on the open competitive market, from a willing and reasonably knowledgeable seller to a willing and reasonably knowledgeable buyer, with neither acting under any compulsion to buy or sell, giving due consideration to all available economic uses of the property at the time of the appraisal.”  

This definition makes no linkage between the estimated market value and exposure time.  A specific exposure time shall not be cited in an appraisal report prepared under UASFLA standards.  Invoke the Jurisdictional Exception Rule to avoid a violation of USPAP standards, which require a specific exposure time.

No other definition of market value is acceptable.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of work is a desk technical review to assure the appraisal meets the definition of an appraisal, examine the appraisals to assure that they meet applicable appraisal requirements which include Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA), supplemental standards issued by NRCS, and appraisal instructions.   The technical appraisal review will be in compliance with USPAP Standard 3, UASFLA, and supplemental standards, and will be type-written, dated and signed by the reviewer.  All items contained in Standard 3 of USPAP must be documented by the review appraiser in the technical appraisal review report. The appraisal reviewer will be required to make a determination as to the acceptability of the appraisal in accordance with instruction provided to the appraiser and these instructions.

The review appraiser may be instructed to express their own opinion of value.  This determination will be made on a case by case basis by the authorized official and will be included in any work order.  
The review appraiser will determine if the appraisal is recommended (as the basis for establishment of the amount believed to be just compensation), or not accepted.  
The review appraiser must obtain a copy of the listed standards at their own expense and have them available during any technical review for reference.   

The review appraiser shall clearly identify the timeframe, not to exceed 12 months, within which the technical appraisal review report is useable for the intended purpose.  The expiration date of all NRCS approved appraisals shall be based upon the market trends as reflected in the appraisal report.  No appraisal report shall be used as the basis of any transaction if it does not represent current market conditions and values as of the date of the decision.  

The review appraiser shall prominently state in the review report any crop base acres and allotment history that are located in the easement area and if it was included in the appraisal.

The technical review report will be attached to the appraisal. 
If the review appraiser determines the appraisal report is recommended, the review appraiser will set forth in the review report the recommended value, if the appraisal report complies with the assignment standards and adequately supports the value estimate, and specifically document any damages or benefits to any remaining property. A copy of the appraisal and technical review will be submitted to the National Headquarters (NHQ) staff appraiser for review and monitoring upon receipt.     
If the review appraiser determines the appraisal report is not acceptable, the review appraiser will provide NHQ staff appraiser with the reasons the appraisal report was not acceptable in the appraisal review report.  NHQ staff appraiser will make a determination if the appraiser should be contacted, by whom and determine if the appraisal report should be returned for corrections or if a new appraisal should be ordered.  The review appraiser may be instructed to work with the appraiser to obtain an acceptable appraisal in an advisory role.  If the technical review appraiser does not recommend or accept the appraisal report, the Option to Purchase will not be signed until an acceptable appraisal report is obtained for the offered property.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: All interested sources are requested to submit a resume and credentials to clearly demonstrate qualifications.  Credentials submissions should be sent to Bethany Mills, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 655 Parfet Street, Lakewood, CO 80215.  Submissions can also be emailed to bethany.mills@co.usda.gov or faxed to (720)544-2962.  Submissions will be accepted until 30 June 2006 with an initial cutoff for submissions will be 31 May 2006.

<RESPDATE>061906
<ARCHDATE>08182006
<CONTACT>Philip Weckesser, 732-532-2396
<DESC>The Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) is a tactical data radio system that is currently in production and is managed by Project Manager, Tactical Radio Communications Systems, Fort Monmouth, NJ.  EPLRS provides a mobile wireless dat a communications backbone for the Armys Tactical Internet, provides embedded situational awareness/position navigation, and is a common system for Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps war fighters.  EPLRS is a key enabler for network centric warfare.  E PLRS supports the Modular Army and is interoperable with US Air Force, US Marine Corps and US Navy EPLRS Radios.  EPLRS mobile networks are used by Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) and Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) host computers for  situational awareness and command & control.  EPLRS consists of an EPLRS Network Manager (ENM) and radios that can be configured for manpack, vehicular and airborne use.          Contract Number DAAB07-97-C-C775 was awarded as a Firm Fixed Price contract on a sole source basis to Raytheon Systems Company, 1801 West Hughes Drive, Fullerton, California 92833 on 16 Sep 97 for the manufacture of approximately 2300 the Raytheon designed  EPLRS radio RT-1720( ).  The contract has been modified over the years to increase the number of radios to be procured.  To date a total of approximately 15, 000 EPLRS radios have been delivered or are on contract to be delivered. Scope of Effort: The scope of this market survey is three fold in nature.  Identify sources for the following: 1.	Production of the EPLRS ADDSI Receiver-Transmitter, NSN 5820-01-514-1408, P/N A3285962.  Additional quantities of EPLRS radios are required to meet new Department of Defense fielding requirements as well as requirement growth to support the Armys Modul ar Force reorganization.  The current manufacturer is Raytheon Company, Fullerton, California 92833-2200.  Raytheon Company is the developer and prime contractor for EPLRS radios and the EPLRS Net Manager.  Raytheon Company maintains configuration manageme nt of internal modules and maintains the software source code.  The Government does not have detailed documentation on hardware modules, software/firmware or source code.  Consequently, the Government does not have the detailed documentation or source code  to provide to a third party.   A technical data package is not available.   The Governments requirement for EPLRS radios calls for the Firm-Fixed-Price acquisition of up to approximately 3,000 EPLRS ADDSI Receiver-Transmitters (RTs), with inherent produc tion qualification testing and initial software programming requirements.  Contract modification award is planned for the 1st or 2nd quarter of Fiscal Year 07.  The resultant contact is expected to consist of a base year and one (1) option year.  Initial d eliveries are expected within six (6) months of receipt of order.  Production rates should average 200 radios per month with a surge capability of up to 400 radios per month.  This will allow the Department of Defense to continue to implement its objective  to digitize and modularize the battlefield.  Any radios produced under this proposed contract will be fully interoperable with the currently fielded system. 2.	Provide an initial quantity of up to 1000 EPLRS Microlight 3G radios to evaluate an interim solution to provide tactical internet capability to the individual soldier.  To do this the Government is currently pursuing an effort to expand the capability o f the EPLRS configuration to add an additional smaller form factor radio, titled the Microlight 3G, capable of running a Software Communication Architecture (SCA) 2.2 compliant Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) or Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EP LRS) waveform (operator selectable), to provide the dismounted soldier connectivity to the Tactical Internet.  Hardware deliveries need to start within six months of award.  Prior to the effort described herein, final design and pro duct qualification of the M3G will have been provided for through a formal change order to the existing EPLRS configuration 3.  Production of up to a total of 300 twenty watt power amplifiers to support the EPLRS Microlight 3 G and SINCGARS Sidehat radios. The power amplifier is an external power source for the EPLRS Microlight 3G and SINCGARS Sidehat radios that is used to boo st signal strength.  Hardware deliveries need to start within six months of award.  The intent is to produce the necessary ancillary hardware to support the interim evaluation of the an interim solution to provide tactical internet capability to the indivi dual soldier Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  Suppliers capable of manufacturing the EPLRS radios and ancillary hardware shall respond in writing and shall identify their capability to both produce the end i tem and conduct production qualification testing and software loading.  The response should be a short introductory description (unclassified) of a viable approach meeting the above needs, and should address production capacity and surge capability.  There  should be some technical description of the proposed subsystem/technologies to include configuration and capabilities and how this will meet the anticipated requirement.  Additional documentation such as test results, product descriptions, and previous pe rformance, may be appended.

Item No. 0001:  Enterprise Engineer Foundation Client – Contributor License Annual Standard Support & Maintenance Renewal; Quantity = 360

Item No. 0002: Enterprise Engineer Foundation Client – Consumer License Annual Standard Support and Maintenance Renewal; Quantity = 240

These items will be sole sourced on the following basis:

The Governement's CAD Library Project Management team determined that the only engineering COTS product that can integrate with Documentum and is supported by EMC Documentum is McLaren Enterprise Engineer.  There are no software alternatives that can allow Documentum to work with CAD drawings and support of the CAD Library cannot continue without utilization of the Enterprise Engineer software.  The CAD Library is composed of approximately 30 CAD Library servers, that need to be maintained, and 600 Documentum licenses and many people and projects would be affected without these services.   McLaren Software is the developer of the software and the software is proprietary in nature.

Statement of Work



I.	Assessing the Legal Environment for Partner Counseling and Referral Services (PCRS)

A.	Project Identification & Purpose.

The purpose of this project is to conduct a legal review and assessment of state laws, policies, and administrative rules concerning PCRS, culminating in a comprehensive report that frames the current legal environment for PCRS in the United States.  


B.	Background and Need

As part of the CDC’s Advancing HIV Prevention Initiative (AHPI), the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) is emphasizing HIV PCRS as an important strategy for reducing HIV transmission in the United States.  The published literature indicates that PCRS is effective and cost-effective for reaching persons at very high risk for HIV infection and is acceptable to individuals seeking HIV testing, HIV-infected persons, and notified partners.  Unfortunately, a recently published survey by Matt Golden found that, in 22 jurisdictions with HIV reporting, health departments interviewed only 32% of 20,353 persons with newly reported HIV (Golden MR, Hogben M, Potterat JJ, Handsfield HH.  HIV partner notification in the United States: A national survey of program coverage and outcomes.  Sex Transm Dis 2004;31:709-12).  Health department program data submitted to CDC, also indicates that PCRS is highly underutilized and that PCRS program performance needs substantial improvement.

For these reasons, DHAP and the Division of STD Prevention (DSTDP) are embarking on a revision of the HIV PCRS guidance.  The specific aims of this project are to (1) revise and update the CDC HIV PCRS guidance and integrate it into CDC’s guidelines for STD partner services; (2) recommend strategies for implementing the revised guidelines and improving partner services program performance; and (3) identify critical unanswered questions and key areas for research and evaluation.  The revised, integrated document will provide a single, unified set of guidelines to serve as the basis for CDC-funded HIV partner services programs and revised training and capacity-building assistance related to PCRS.

DHAP and DSTP recognize that existing laws and regulations concerning partner notification, particularly at the state and local levels, may impact effective implementation of the revised, integrated PCRS guidance.  For this reason, they are seeking a review of relevant laws and regulation to provide an overview of legal requirements concerning partner notification (including spousal) at the state and local levels. 

C.	Statement of Work  

Task 1:Legal Review and Assessment of Laws and Policies Concerning PCRS 
The contractor shall identify and assess existing legal issues related to PCRS at the state and local levels.  The contractor shall design a template table and will then use the template to catalog existing statutory or regulatory legal provisions that authorize or affect PCRS at the state and local levels, either positively or negatively.  The outcome of this initial stage will be the completion of a comprehensive table that summarizes the legal status of PCRS on key issues within health department jurisdictions funded by CDC to conduct HIV prevention programs, including PCRS (the 50 states, the district of Columbia, and the six funded directly by CDC: New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Houston).  

Task 2: Authoritative Guidance Based on Initial Review  
The contractor shall produce and deliver to NCHSTP a comprehensive report that describes the current legal environment for PCRS through detailed analysis of the review and assessment of state and local laws conducted during Task 1.  In addition to summarizing the results of the comprehensive table, the report shall provide relevant examples of both common and exceptional legal requirements, analyze how these provisions may affect the implementation of PCRS, and assess legal obstacles to and pathways toward effective utilization of PCRS under CDC’s new guidance.   


D.	Period of Performance/Delivery Schedule
The period of performance shall be June 19, 2006 through October 27, 2006. 


Task	Item Description	Quantity	Delivery Date
			
Task 1	1. Comprehensive table cataloguing state and local laws related to PCRS provisions	1	3 ½ months after award
Task 2	2. Comprehensive report summarizing the current legal environment for PCRS	1 copy	4 ½ months after award
Tasks 1&2	3. Initial conference call to review contractor’s plan for conducting the project 	1 	2 weeks after award
Tasks 1&2	4. Regular conference calls to discuss progress	6-8	Bi-weekly after initial conference call

<DESC>Brunswick Job Corps Center is requesting bidders for a project of an estimated $500,000 to $1,000,000 to finish the electrical upgrade for building #1. A mandatory pre-bid conference will take place on June 22, 2006. For more information, contact Patricia at 912-264-8843x139 or email at willover.patricia@jobcorps.org. 

Scope of Work: The area of work is in building 1 of the Brunswick Job Corps Center. All Federal Pacific distribution panels and branch circuit panel boards are to be replaced. There are also old GE panels that have been field modified or have been damaged that are to be replaced. The original feeders to these panels should be removed and replaced with new feeder conduit and wire. New feeder conduits will be routed above the ceiling in the corridors unless it can be run through the interstitial space. All panels (new and existing) shall receive new completely accurate updated panel schedules to reflect what exist on site (all circuits should be identified through contractor circuit tracing). Any existing and new wiring, conduit and boxes in the interstitial space shall be made code compliant. Add new emergency lights throughout the corridors and stairwells wired to the local lighting circuits ahead of all switching. Lead painting and asbestos specifications are given to provide abatement criteria for the installation of this work. In general, the areas containing asbestos should be avoided to minimize the abatement requirement. Based on the age of this building, all painted surfaces should be assumed to have lead paint for the base layers. All holes drilled in or through painted surfaces should follow all OSHA and specification requirements for lead paint abatement. 

The work shall be performed in one continuous phase. The center must remain operational throughout this project. All panel and feeder replacements that require shutting down power must be coordinated with the center. Special attention should be given to the kitchen area since the coolers, freezers, ice machines, etc., can only be shut down for one hour periods. Otherwise the kitchen cooling equipment will require a temporary feed from another panel or generator. This brief description of the scope of work is not all inclusive and is complimented by the set of construction documents. 

Alternative #1:
Quote a deduct to leave all D-wing dorm area branch circuit panels in place (do not replace) along with the associated feeder conduit and wire from MDP-3. All other panel replacements and new conduits and feeder in D-wing are to remain in scope.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for professional consultant services, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. MCC06RFQ0056 is being issued as a Request for Quotation.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-23.  The National American Industry Classification System code is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $6,000,000.   The Millennium Challenge Corporation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division, 875 15th Street NW, Washington DC 20005, is a Federal Corporation created under Title VI of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2004. MCC seeks to contract a short-term Impact Evaluation Expert to assess the proposed impact evaluation of the Watershed Management and Agriculture Support Project of the Government of Cape Verde. This Scope of Work requires the provision of technical assistance to MCC and the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) counterpart country management unit (MCA-Cape Verde). Accordingly, MCC seeks to contract a short-term Agricultural Impact Evaluation Expert to improve the proposed impact evaluation plan, methodology and data collection instruments for the Watershed Management and Agriculture Support Project (WMAS). The Impact Evaluation should measure the increase in economic growth as well as the reduction in poverty in the intervention areas attributable to MCA funded project interventions.The Watershed Management and Agriculture Support (WMAS) Project is designed to increase agricultural productivity in three specific watershed areas through the following project activities: (i) improved water management and soil conservation (building reservoirs and small dams, monitoring aquifer levels, etc), (ii) enhanced agribusiness development and marketing services (training on drip irrigation, packing sheds, quality control centers, other technical assistance), and (iii) increased access to credit (specifically for farmers to adopt drip irrigation). The three intervention areas include: Paul (Island of Santo Antao), Faja (Island of Sao Nicolau) and Mosteiros (Island of Fogo).

Introduction:

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the lead Federal agency for enhancing the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health services and access to such services.   AHRQ is one of several public health service agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) along with fellow agencies including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration.  Located in Rockville, Maryland, AHRQ is supported by a staff of approximately 300 federal employees with diverse and varied administrative, operational and research responsibilities.

AHRQ conducts and supports a broad base of scientific research and promotion of improvements in clinical and health system practices, including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions.  The AHRQ mission is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.  AHRQ sponsors and conducts applied and development research which produces information that can be used by decision makers in the public and private sectors to improve the outcomes and quality of health care, reduce its costs, address patient safety and medical errors, broaden access to effective services and facilitate its rapid translation, utilization and adoption into practice. 

The agency maintains 9 major functional components:

Office of the Director directs the activities of the Agency to ensure that strategic objectives are achieved.

Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer designs, develops, implements, and manages programs for disseminating the results of Agency activities with the goal of changing audience behavior. 
Office of Extramural Research, Education and Priority Populations directs the scientific review process for grants and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts, manages Agency research training programs, evaluates the scientific contribution of proposed and ongoing research, demonstrations, and evaluations, and supports and conducts health services research on priority populations.

Office of Performance Accountability, Resources, and Technology directs and coordinates Agency-wide program planning and evaluation activities and administrative operations.

Center for Delivery, Organization, and Markets provides a locus of leadership and expertise for advances in health care delivery, organization, and markets through research.

Center for Financing, Access and Cost Trends conducts, supports, and manages studies of the cost and financing of health care, the access to health care services and related trends. CFACT also develops data sets to support policy and behavioral research and analyses.

Center for Outcomes and Evidence conducts and supports research and assessment of health care practices, technologies, processes, and systems.

Center for Primary Care, Prevention, and Clinical Partnerships expands the knowledge base for clinical providers and patients and to assure the translation of new knowledge and systems improvement into primary care practice.

Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety works to improve the quality and safety of our health care system through research and implementation of evidence.

Background: 

AHRQ is considered a small Operational Division (Op/Div) in HHS which presents unique challenges in implementing an Ombudsperson program.  As such, the Human Relations functions such as Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and Employee Relations have been centralized off site with access provided to employees and members of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Services upon request. By their design, these rights based programs are formal in nature.  As a consequence, when an issue is raised by an employee, it may rise to a higher administrative level when no other recourse is available.  Therefore, an organizational Ombudsperson, as a designated neutral and  impartial dispute resolution practitioner, is being established at AHRQ whose primary function is to provide independent, confidential, and informal assistance to all of the organization’s employees.

The Ombudsperson role has a long and valued tradition as a means of protecting employees against perceived abuse, bias, and other improper treatment or unfairness and enhancing the values of the organization’s culture.  As a designated neutral party, the Ombudsperson is neither an advocate for an individual or the organization but, rather, acts as an advocate for fairness.  The Ombudsperson acts as a source of information and referral, aids in answering individuals’ questions, and assists in the resolution of concerns and critical situations. In considering any given instance or concern, the interests and rights of all parties who might be involved are taken into account. The Ombudsperson supplements and does not replace or circumvent the formal Administrative Grievance Procedure, EEO system or the duties and responsibilities of the Office of Inspection General. Rather the Ombudsperson accesses these programs as needed in service to the employee.

Scope (Function)

The Contractor shall establish, provide and operate an effective Organizational Ombudsperson services program utilizing a conflict resolution management system that assists all federal employees and members of the Commission Corps of the Public Health Service to identify, manage, mitigate and resolve all types of problems that impact their work experience, including those disputes that do not fall into a category protected by statute, contract, or specific policy (such as interpersonal disputes that relate to employee responsibilities). An effective Organizational Ombudsperson services program shall also identify and assess systemic trends in the organization that adversely impact on its overall function, and recommend systems improvements that benefit and enhance the work life of AHRQ’s employees, its function and its culture.  The Contractor shall implement a systematic approach that focuses on the causes of conflict within the organization.  The purview of the Ombudsperson position includes "non-hierarchical" disputes between and among employees and managers.  Such an integrated system is available to all federal employees in the workplace (i.e., workers, managers, professionals, groups, teams involved in disputes).

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and is being made in accordance with the test program for commercial items as authorized in Far Part 13.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  

This solicitation No., RFQ-NCI-60047-NG, includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-08 (January 2006).  

The North American Industry Classification Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

STATEMENT OF WORK: Measurement of Arsenic, Selenium, and Zinc in Toenail Samples from a Case-Control Study of Bladder Cancer in New England using Neutron Activation Analysis.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  Exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water is associated with elevated risk of several internal cancers, and in particular, bladder cancer.  The observation that bladder cancer risk is elevated subsequent to arsenic ingestion comes from studies in several populations worldwide, including Southwest Taiwan, Northeast Taiwan, Northern Chile, and Cordoba Province of Argentina.  These populations historically have been exposed to very high levels of arsenic in their drinking water, and dramatic risk elevations are observed, with relative risks ranging from 3 or 4 to 15, compared to populations with low levels of arsenic in their drinking water.  Exposures in these regions of the world ranged between 200 ug/L to 1500 ug/L.  
	
The National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with Dartmouth Medical School and several state Departments of Health, has completed the field work in a large case-control study of bladder cancer in Northern New England (Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire).  This study was motivated by the persistent elevated rates of bladder cancer mortality and incidence in these three states.  Reasons for this elevation are poorly understood.  

Arsenic in drinking water has emerged as a leading hypothesis that may explain the excess bladder cancer in New England.  Low- to moderate levels of arsenic in bedrock aquifers used for drinking water, especially in private wells, occur in extended parts of the region.   Based on what is known about the distribution of arsenic in Northern New England, and assuming a straight line extrapolation from the well-established risk of bladder cancer observed at high levels of exposure, the excess risk in rural areas appears to fit the expected level of risk.  However, to date there have been no reliable assessments of bladder cancer risk in populations exposed to the lower levels of arsenic in water that are found in New England, and evaluation of this is an important part of the design of the NCI epidemiologic study.   

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT:  The main objective is to determine levels of arsenic, selenium, and zinc in toenail samples collected from subjects who participated in a case-control study of bladder cancer.  The data will be used to estimate exposure to these elements in the context of the case-control study.  

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall:	

1	Analyze samples for the presence and concentration of arsenic (As), selenium (Se), and Zinc (Zn) using nuclear activation analysis (NAA).  

2	Prepare all samples as necessary (routine analysis) prior to NAA analysis.  

3	Contractor shall specify whether cleaning of samples prior to analysis is included in the proposal.  If cleaning is included in the proposal, the cost shall be identified as a separately priced line item. 

4	In the case-control study, toenail samples were collected from 2,545 participants.  The weight of each sample is not yet available, and some samples may fall below the minimum required for adequate NAA analysis.  Under the assumption that all samples meet the minimum weight requirements for analysis, 2,545 sample analyses will be required.  In addition, 10% (255 samples) randomly selected samples of adequate size will be split and blindly submitted for quality assurance (QA) purposes.  Thus the maximum number of analyses, including QA samples will be 2,800.  All analyses must be completed, with results submitted, no later than eight (8) months after the start date of this contract.  Higher throughput, which would permit completion of analyses no later than six (6) months after contract initiation, will be to the advantage of the contracting laboratory.

The contractor shall provide a detailed description of quality control/quality assurance procedures that are used for preparation and analysis of blanks and standardized samples.  

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: 

1	The Contractor shall electronically communicate results of all analyses, including quality control information, to the NCI Project Officer on a weekly basis, using an Excel format to be provided by NCI. Problems or delays relating to any aspect of these analyses shall be reported to the NCI Project Officer as soon as noted by the contractor. 

2	Contractor shall provide a summary report of progress, study management, problems, and their resolution, to NCI on a monthly basis, to commence the beginning of the first month after samples have been received by the contractor.  

3	The report shall include, but not be limited to: Counts of the numbers of samples received, analyzed, and whose results were reported in the monthly reporting period, as well as totals to date.  
		
4	The Contractor shall provide a final report to NCI at the conclusion of all analyses which shall include summaries of these same data.  

GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES: NCI will provide to the contractor toenail samples collected from study subjects in the period 2002-2005.  If cleaning of samples is not included in an offeror’s proposal, this will be done by the Government prior to shipment.   In addition to original samples, an additional 10% of the samples will be blinded replicates, indistinguishable from the original samples.  These blinded replicates will be submitted to the contractor for quality control purposes.

Samples will be shipped to the contractor from NCI's sample repository in batches to be determined by consultation and agreement between NCI and the contractor, and at a frequency to be determined in like manner.   Prior to shipment of samples from the NCI repository to the contractor, the batch size used in analysis will be communicated to NCI to permit the rational organization of QA samples.   The weight of each sample shipped from NCI shall be no less than 10 mg. 

INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:  Within two weeks of submission of data to NCI, the Project Officer will review the data submitted to NCI by the contractor, and inform the contractor of any anomalies found and/or corrective action required

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  May 1, 2006 – January 31, 2007.  NOTE:  Offerors may propose a shorter delivery schedule and will be given additional technical points if this shorter delivery schedule is proposed.

<DESC>The US Government intends to procure services to integrate and flight test up to two (2) laser designator payloads for the Shadow TUAV for system demonstration purposes.  This integration includes two (2) Air Vehicles (AVs), one (1) Ground Control St ation (GCS), one (1) Ground Data Terminal (GDT), one (1) Portable GCS (PGCS), and one (1) Portable GDT (PGDT). Payload Specifications are as follows: Payload Size:  less than 10.3 diameter, No external E-box with no more than 7.5                height inside the fuselage and no more than than 7.5 height below                fuselage during take-off and landing. Payload Weight:  less than 50 lbs. Payload Input Voltage & Avg/Max Power:  28V; less than 300W/600W Command Interface:  RS-422 Video Out (switchable between EO & IR):  RS170/SMPTE 250 Gimbal Stabilization and laser spot stability on target:  less than 50 micro-radians;                                                           90% laser energy on 3.5x3.5                                                           meter target at 3.5km                                                           slant range. Boresight Method:  Min=Factory; in-flight desired. EO Sensor Specifications are as follows: Sensor Type:  Color with near IR capability D/R Range (Det=1.5 cycles; Rec=4.5 cycles, 80% Pd/Pr):  greater than 7.1km ID Range (ID=9.75 cycles, 80% Pi):  greater than 3.5km IR Sensor Specifications are as follows: D/R Range (Det=1.0 cycles; Rec=3.0 cycles, 70% Pd/Pr):  greater than 7.1km ID Range (ID=8.25 cycles, 70% Pi):  greater than 3.5km Laser Designator Parameters are as follows: Basic Interoperability:  Minimum: Hellfire Munition LD wavelength:  1.06 micons Pulse energy:  greater than or equal to 40mJ/pulse Beam Divergence:  less than or equal to 400 micro-radians Pulse Width:  greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 25 nanoseconds Pulse Modes:  PRF/PIM Laser Range Finder Parameters are as follows: Effective Range:  greater than 7.1km Accuracy:  +/- 5 meters Prototype/Production:  8/18 months from AOC The payloads selected for integration shall be production representative prototypes that are form, fit, and functionally capable for demonstration within 6 months after contract award.  The prototype payloads will be evaluated against each of the payload s pecification elements stated above.  The evaluation will consist of a laboratory payload characterization and a limited flight evaluation to determine Laser Designator interoperability with the Hellfire missile and ability of the Shadow 200 system to maint ain the laser designator spot on a calibrated target board. Integration of the Laser Designator Payload into the Shadow 200 TUAV shall include coordination with the Payload vendors, software and engineering changes required for the GCS to control both prototype payloads, and Weight and Balance Analyses for each ins tallation to ensure that performance/safety/specifications of the Shadow 200 system and the Hellfire missile are not denigrated by this integration. The System Demonstration phase shall include a flight test program with each Laser Designator Payload.  Test plans shall be in accordance with DI-NDTI-805566.  After each test phase or event, a test report shall be prepared in accordance with DI-NDTI-80809 . A minimum of five (5) hours of flight testing shall be conducted on each candidate system.  Characterization tests during this testing will be used to demonstrate minimum payload performance per the payload specifications above and basic Shadow 200 system / Hellfire missile interoperability.  Sensor performance (detection, recognition, and identification) in both EO and IR modes and laser performance (minimum laser pulse power, pulse width, beam divergence, and jitter control) will be evaluated. Primary considerations for payload evaluations are EO/IR performance (at minimum equivalent to the current POP300), laser power, beam divergence, pulse width, p ointing accuracy, and cost.  The Government will make the final selection of the laser designator payload vendor. Once the primary vendor for the system demonstration is selected, a Hellfire Missile Live Fire Test shall be conducted.  This test will support a minimum of five (5) hours of flight test for a live fire test with the Hellfire missile system.  The live fire  test will demonstrate the ability of the Shadow 200 system with Laser Designator Payload to successfully designate a tank size target for Hellfire missiles, resulting in at least two hits out of three firings.  Range coordination, obtaining and providing test missiles, coordination of government lab test support, generation of Live Fire Test Plan, conduct of Test Readiness Reviews, Flight Readiness Reviews, and execution of the Test Plan shall be coordinated between the contractor and the Joint Missile Pro gram Office. Integration/Flight Testing/System Demonstration is planned as sole source to AAI (CAGE 97384), producer of the Shadow TUAV under Basic Ordering Agreement W31P4Q-05-G-0004.  Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact AAI, 124 Industry  Lane, Hunt Valley, MD 21030. See Note 22.

<DESC>Amendment 1 to add evaluation criteria, clauses and proposal submission information:

EVALUATION OF TECHNICAL PROPOSAL: 

UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
 
The Offeror will demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the requirements necessary to serve as an on site Organizational Ombudsman for a small federal agency that specializes in health services research.   
 
TECHNICAL APPROACH (30 Points)
 
BASELINE
 
The offeror will provide a methodology and plan to establish a baseline from which to measure and evaluate program effectiveness including current patterns, trends, problem areas, system and organizational issues in the Agency’s operations, functions, policies and practices as well as the current ability to improve the organization’s function, quality of work life and cultural health  
 
Offeror will demonstrate how baseline will be used to measure progress or the lack of organizational improvement, functionality and health. This data analysis and synthesis will form the basis from which to demonstrate clear, measured, documented improvements.  If improvements can not be achieved, this data will be able to provide clear documentation to perform a root cause analysis of the barriers to improvement.  
 
MEASUREMENT
 
The offeror will demonstrate the methodology and plan to be used to identify and measure current patterns, trends, problem areas, system and organizational issues in the Agency’s operations, functions, policies and practices  as well as opportunities for Improvement , organization’s functionality and quality of life.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The offeror will demonstrate the methodology and plan by which this data will be synthesized and while maintaining confidentiality, provide information on outputs ( for example individuals served, types of problems, number of problems resolved and unresolved, number of referrals made, level of case complexity, amount of time per case) and productivity.
 
IMPROVEMENT
 
The offeror will demonstrate the methodology and plan for reporting organizational outcomes and impact following implementation of the ombudsman service program (see below), particularly:
1)  Patterns, problem areas and system and organizational issues in the Agency’s operations, functions, policies and practices;
(2) Recommendations for revisions and improvements in such; and 
(3) Assessment of the climate and wellness of the organization.
 
 
MANAGAMENT PLAN (30 Points)
 
The offeror will demonstrate the methodology and plan for implementing the aspects of the statement of work noted below in order to establish and operate an on-site, full time Organizational Ombudsman at AHRQ.
 
Organizational Structure for Ombuds Services Program.
 
Establish and provide an on-site, full-time organizational Ombudsperson and office that shall be independent of, and separate from, the human resource and any other existing administrative structures. 
 
	Establish and maintain an Ombuds Advisory Board whose employee members reflect the diversity of the Agency and which meets monthly with the Ombudsperson. The Advisory Board shall act as a vehicle for information sharing, communication, and solution building for organizational and system issues.
 
 
Establish Overall Framework and Culture for Ombudsperson Service Program.
 
Establish and provide an Ombudsperson services program that is understandable to all, flexible and user-friendly.
 
Establish and provide a process that ensures confidentiality of individual and group communications, organizational neutrality and independence.
 
Establish and provide mechanisms that encourage employees and managers to voice concerns and constructive dissent early and demonstrate a plan to train employees, supervisors and leaders to address conflict constructively
 
     Promote and maintain a culture that welcomes good faith dissent, and encourages resolution of conflict at the lowest level through direct negotiation. 
 
Demonstrate the methodology and plan by which the Ombudsman will affect cultural change and improvement for the employee and management that positively impacts on the organization and its ability to meet and exceed its mission and vision.
 
Establish and maintain a collaborative problem-solving approach, which promotes direct negotiation between those involved in a dispute.
 
Establish and maintain multiple access points to enable employees to receive advice concerning conflict management issues and assistance in addressing their concerns
 
Develop and Provide Processes and Procedures to Implement the Ombudsperson Service Program.
 
Provide options (rights-based and interest-based) for most types of problems and for all AHRQ employees, including staff, supervisors, professionals, and managers to address conflicts, disputes, issues and concerns. These may occur between two individuals, groups, or organizations, particularly:
 
Formal mediation. (Mediation is the only formal interest-based option. In mediation, an impartial third party, with neither decision-making authority nor the power to impose a resolution, works with the disputants to help them reach a mutually acceptable resolution to all or some of the issues in dispute.) 
 
Generic approaches (i.e. to dispel a problem linked to some individual without explicitly drawing attention either to that individual or to themselves). The Ombudsperson shall suggest a generic approach aimed at changing a process in the workplace or at alerting possible offenders to the need to stop their inappropriate behavior.
 
Establish and provide mechanisms for continuous and constructive communication to all AHRQ employees, with a focus on information sharing, education, and stakeholder feedback and systems improvement.
            
Establish and provide training programs for the Agency in dispute/conflict resolution, mediation, negotiation, facilitation, civility, and related topics. 
 
Establish and provide on-going education and communication about the office’s role to all AHRQ employees and members of the Commission Corps including line staff, supervisors, professionals, and managers.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and is being made in accordance with the test program for commercial items as authorized in Far Part 13.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  

This solicitation No., RFQ-NCI-60047-NG, includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-08 (January 2006).

STATEMENT OF WORK: Measurement of Arsenic, Selenium, and Zinc in Toenail Samples from a Case-Control Study of Bladder Cancer in New England using Neutron Activation Analysis.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  Exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water is associated with elevated risk of several internal cancers, and in particular, bladder cancer.  The observation that bladder cancer risk is elevated subsequent to arsenic ingestion comes from studies in several populations worldwide, including Southwest Taiwan, Northeast Taiwan, Northern Chile, and Cordoba Province of Argentina.  These populations historically have been exposed to very high levels of arsenic in their drinking water, and dramatic risk elevations are observed, with relative risks ranging from 3 or 4 to 15, compared to populations with low levels of arsenic in their drinking water.  Exposures in these regions of the world ranged between 200 ug/L to 1500 ug/L.  
	
The National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with Dartmouth Medical School and several state Departments of Health, has completed the field work in a large case-control study of bladder cancer in Northern New England (Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire).  This study was motivated by the persistent elevated rates of bladder cancer mortality and incidence in these three states.  Reasons for this elevation are poorly understood.  

Arsenic in drinking water has emerged as a leading hypothesis that may explain the excess bladder cancer in New England.  Low- to moderate levels of arsenic in bedrock aquifers used for drinking water, especially in private wells, occur in extended parts of the region.   Based on what is known about the distribution of arsenic in Northern New England, and assuming a straight line extrapolation from the well-established risk of bladder cancer observed at high levels of exposure, the excess risk in rural areas appears to fit the expected level of risk.  However, to date there have been no reliable assessments of bladder cancer risk in populations exposed to the lower levels of arsenic in water that are found in New England, and evaluation of this is an important part of the design of the NCI epidemiologic study.   

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT:  The main objective is to determine levels of arsenic, selenium, and zinc in toenail samples collected from subjects who participated in a case-control study of bladder cancer.  The data will be used to estimate exposure to these elements in the context of the case-control study.  

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall:	

1	Analyze samples for the presence and concentration of arsenic (As), selenium (Se), and Zinc (Zn) using nuclear activation analysis (NAA).  

2	Prepare all samples as necessary (routine analysis) prior to NAA analysis.  

3	Contractor shall specify whether cleaning of samples prior to analysis is included in the proposal.  If cleaning is included in the proposal, the cost shall be identified as a separately priced line item. 

4	In the case-control study, toenail samples were collected from 2,545 participants.  The weight of each sample is not yet available, and some samples may fall below the minimum required for adequate NAA analysis.  Under the assumption that all samples meet the minimum weight requirements for analysis, 2,545 sample ansolicitation No., RFQ-NCI-60047-NG, includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-08 (January 2006).

The weight of each sample is not yet available, and some samples may fall below the minimum required for adequate NAA analysis.  Under the assumption that all samples meet the minimum weight requirements for analysis, 2,545 sample analyses will be required.  In addition, 10% (255 samples) randomly selected samples of adequate size will be split and blindly submitted for quality assurance (QA) purposes.  Thus the maximum number of analyses, including QA samples will be 2,800.  All analyses must be completed, with results submitted, no later than eight (8) months after the start date of this contract.  Higher throughput, which would permit completion of analyses no later than six (6) months after contract initiation, will be to the advantage of the contracting laboratory.

The contractor shall provide a detailed description of quality control/quality assurance procedures that are used for preparation and analysis of blanks and standardized samples.  

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: 

1	The Contractor shall electronically communicate results of all analyses, including quality control information, to the NCI Project Officer on a weekly basis, using an Excel format to be provided by NCI. Problems or delays relating to any aspect of these analyses shall be reported to the NCI Project Officer as soon as noted by the contractor. 

2	Contractor shall provide a summary report of progress, study management, problems, and their resolution, to NCI on a monthly basis, to commence the beginning of the first month after samples have been received by the contractor.  

3	The report shall include, but not be limited to: Counts of the numbers of samples received, analyzed, and whose results were reported in the monthly reporting period, as well as totals to date.  
		
4	The Contractor shall provide a final report to NCI at the conclusion of all analyses which shall include summaries of these same data.  

GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES: NCI will provide to the contractor toenail samples collected from study subjects in the period 2002-2005.  If cleaning of samples is not included in an offeror’s proposal, this will be done by the Government prior to shipment.   In addition to original samples, an additional 10% of the samples will be blinded replicates, indistinguishable from the original samples.  These blinded replicates will be submitted to the contractor for quality control purposes.

Samples will be shipped to the contractor from NCI's sample repository in batches to be determined by consultation and agreement between NCI and the contractor, and at a frequency to be determined in like manner.   Prior to shipment of samples from the NCI repository to the contractor, the batch size used in analysis will be communicated to NCI to permit the rational organization of QA samples.   The weight of each sample shipped from NCI shall be no less than 10 mg. 

INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:  Within two weeks of submission of data to NCI, the Project Officer will review the data submitted to NCI by the contractor, and inform the contractor of any anomalies found and/or corrective action required

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  May 1, 2006 – January 31, 2007.  NOTE:  Offerors may propose a shorter delivery schedule and will be given additional technical points if this shorter delivery schedule is proposed.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO QUOTERS:

BASIS FOR AWARD:  Award will be made, subject to available funding and quoter responsibility, to that acceptable quote, the price or cost of which is not necessarily the lowest, but which is sufficiently more advantageous to the Government than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of additional amounts, based on the evaluation criteria described in this section.

<SUBJECT>B -- Measurement of Arsenic, Selenium and Zinc in Toenail Samples from a Case-Control Study of Bladder Cancer in New England using Neurton Activation Analysis.
<SOLNBR>RFQ-NCI-60047-NG
<RESPDATE>032306

<DESC>Synopsis/solicitation RFQ-NCI-60047-NG is hereby amended to answer questions received from interested parties.  The due date is NOT extended.  All other articles remain unchanged. 

1.  Question:  In regards to the measurement of As, Se and Zn by INAA, what are the required or desired detection limits (measurement sensitivity) for each of these elements for this study?

Answer:  Using neutron activation analysis (NAA), arsenic has been quantified at levels above the detection limit in almost all toenail samples measured with this method.  The issue of detection limits was therefore not of concern when we decided that NAA was preferred, for the reasons noted below.

2.  Question:  Solicitation RFQ-NCI-60047-NG requests neuron activation analysis of toenail clippings for arsenic, selenium, and zinc.  This email is written to identify whether inductively coupled plasma dynamic reaction cell mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-Ms) would be an acceptable alternative. 

Answer:  

i.    The Government assumes that the question pertains to neutron activation analysis (NAA), not neuron activation analysis, as in the question.     
ii.   A non-destructive analytical method was chosen, so as to preserve the specimens for future analyses of other factors.
iii.  NAA was selected to permit the measurements to be fully compatible with closely related studies conducted in New England.
iv.  NAA has often been used in analyses of toenails for the purpose of exposure assessment in studies of arsenic-exposed populations.  In these populations, toenail arsenic is correlated with other, independent measures of arsenic exposure.

3.  Question:  One must wonder why NAA was selected here, other than the fact that it is a non-destructive technique.  Few labs have access to a nuclear reactor for anything like the kind of time necessary to measure these elements in this number of specimens, and those that do may lack the validation for these clinical matrices.  NAA may yet prove to be cost prohibitive.  How was NAA selected for this RFQ.  Was any thought given to other analytical approaches?

Answer:  See answer to question 2 above.

4.  Question:  I had wondered why NCI would even bother trying to assess trace element exposure using toenails.  We know that nails are an unreliable matrix (non-homogeneous trace element distribution), subject to unknown exogenous contamination and, washing procedures notwithstanding, subject to leaching of bound metals.

It seems to me that serum and/or plasma specimens would yield more reliable estimates of Zn and Se nutritional status.  As for as exposure, timed urine specimens (or a spot urine corrected for creatinine excretion) would make better sense.  Yes, as is excreted slowly in nails and hair making a cumulative assessment potential feasible.  Unfortunately, the quality of this specimen (toenail) must surely negate any potential gains.  Since national databases exists for serum Se, Zn and As, they might prove better benchmarks with which to compare local data.

Answer:  Our primary interest is in assessing long-term cumulative exposure to arsenic among individuals in a specific study population.  For this purpose, toenails from study subjects are preferable to other biologic samples that would provide estimates of temporally proximate exposures.  Spot urine samples were also collected from all subjects, and overnight urine and blood samples were collected from a random sample of respondents.  Arsenic speciation has been completed for all urine samples, along with creatinine concentrations.
