<DESC>NIH/ORS requires the services of highly qualified staff to provide interpreting services for the needs of staff, patients, guests and visitors who are deaf/hard of hearing.  The solicitation number is 263-04-P-(GJ)-0024.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541930 and the size standard is $6,000,000. This solicitation is a small business set-aside.  As the world’s premier biomedical research institution, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is committed to meeting the needs of staff, patients, guests and visitors who are deaf/hard of hearing (D/HH).  The NIH uses interpreting services to facilitate communication for events/meetings such as work related meetings, training sessions, safety talks, discussions on work related procedures, policies and assignments, disciplinary actions, conferences and other special occasions as requested.  Last year NIH used 12,500 hours.  On average, the NIH uses approximately 12,277 hours annually.  The services are primarily on and off the NIH Bethesda campus, surrounding areas in Montgomery County, Frederick, and Baltimore.  The contractor is to provide qualified interpreters to meet these requirements. The need for a qualified interpreting services contractor exists because of the continual growth, professional development and daily work routine of the D/HH employees at NIH.  The NIH currently provides services through a centrally-funded and managed contract. The NIH employs approximately 22,000 persons of which an estimated 100 are self-identified as D/HH, who are located primary on the Bethesda Campus as well as leased facilities throughout Montgomery County, MD.  NIH staffs are also located in Frederick and Baltimore, with occasional requests taking place there which require these services.  In certain circumstances on a case by case basis, the NIH will make prior arrangements with the contractor to reimburse for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the interpreter (i.e., mileage, parking, tolls, lodging) in accordance with U.S. Government/NIH travel regulations.  Interpreting services are used principally for meetings, patient consultations, lectures and special events. In addition, social activities with government employees and patients, guests and visitors who are at the NIH may also require interpreting services.  The contractor shall provide adequate interpreting services as well as the overall management of operations in order to meet our growing demand. The NIH plans to advise the contractor of an interpreting service requirement at least 5 working days in advance of the event/meeting.   The requests will include a description of the event/meeting, location, planned duration, and recommended interpreter (if requested).  All requests received 5 working days prior to an event/meeting must be filled and confirmed within 1 working day of receipt of request.  Any requests received with less than 5 working days advanced notice should be filled according to the Performance Requirements Summary.  A Qualified Interpreter is a person who has a college degree (A.A., B.S., B.A., M.A., or M.S.), in an interpreting related field, with at least 3 years of current interpreting work experience.  If the interpreter has no college degree, he/she shall have at least 5 years of current interpreting work experience.  A person may also be considered qualified if he/she is certified through screening as recognized by the National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) and/or the National Association for the Deaf (NAD) (levels 4 or 5 only).  Basic interpreting services, include, but are not limited to, sign language, oral, tactile, close-vision, deaf interpreting, and cued speech.  Qualified interpreters must meet the following minimum knowledge, skills, and abilities: a. Fluency of sign language on the entire sign language continuum to effectively facilitate communication between D/HH employees and hearing employees; b. Ability to perform at least one of the following: (1) interpret voice to sign, (2) interpret sign to voice, (3) oral transliteration, (4) tactile, (5) close-vision, (6) deaf interpreting, and (7) cued speech; c. Ability to interpret in a variety of settings, including those that require specialized, technical, legal, scientific, medical, library, and information technology vocabulary, and familiarity with government vernaculars; d. Ability to keep pace with communications in conferences, meetings, seminars, training classes, etc.; e. Ability to voice interpret when a D/HH person’s speech is not easily understood; f. Ability to abstract, select and highlight within context when dealing with complicated concepts, idioms, etc.; g. Practicing knowledge of and adherence to the RID and/or NAD Code of Ethics; h. Knowledge of the diversity of cultures within the D/HH community to effectively work as an interpreter; i. Knowledge and skill to prepare for each interpreting assignment including the knowledge needed to assist in setting up an environment that is conducive to meeting the communication needs of both the hearing and deaf consumer; j. Ability to effectively assess the language needs of the deaf consumer; and, k. Ability to apply the analytical skills necessary to determine which communication modes the deaf consumer is utilizing.  The NIH has a small need for interpreting emergency and non-emergency requests during both NIH business hours and non-business hours which may also occur during Federal government holidays or weekends.  For any request that is received for interpreting services, the NIH will pay a minimum of two hours for the interpreter’s time.  In addition, payment will also be made for any cancellations if they are made less than 2 full business days prior to a previously scheduled event date.  The Contract type is anticipated to be Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity (FPIQ) with a one-year base period and 4 one-year options. Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of overall best value for the government. Technical factors are more important than cost.  The Evaluation Factors are: 1. Understanding the Requirement; 2. Providing Interpreting Services; 3. Demonstrated Ability to Coordinate Services; 4. Past Performance; 5. Demonstrated Ability and Skill in Providing Customer Service.  Requests for the RFP must be in writing and addressed to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Sanford Cook, National Institutes of Health, DHHS, Division of Station Support Acquisition, 6011 Executive Boulevard, Room 529M, Rockville, MD 20892.  The FAX number is (301) 402-3407.  Mr. Cook’s e-mail address is SanfordC@OD.NIH.GOV.  His telephone number is (301) 402-5583.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about March 23, 2004 to solicit proposals for the research and development of an X-ray imaging device capable of indicating concealed U.S. Treasury Notes (currency).  X-ray technology is the most developed of all the physics-based technologies currently available, and various X-ray imaging systems are already currently being used by Customs as anomaly detectors.  The contractor shall be required to analyze and quantify the elemental content of selected currency notes.  The contractor shall be required to identify a set of currency-specific elements to be used for X-ray imaging detection of currency. The contractor shall use a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) X-ray imaging system currently being used by Customs to evaluate the system’s ability to detect concealed currency based on imaging the identified set of currency-specific elements.  As necessary, the most promising COTS device shall be modified to improve its bulk currency detection capability based on imaging the set of previously identified currency-specific elements that will be spatially co-located.

Interested parties may request the RFP from the Contracting Officer, John A. Palmieri, through email requests at john.palmieri@do.treas.gov. The Request for Proposals will be released on or about March 23, 2004. A pre-proposal conference will be conducted on or about April 6, 2004. The time and place for the conference will be announced in the RFP. Questions and/or clarification requests related to the RFP shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer by email at john.palmieri@do.treas.gov by March 31, 2004 and will be addressed at the pre-proposal conference. Treasury will use the questions and clarification requests to determine if changes to the RFP will be necessary. Proposals shall be required on or about May 4, 2004.

<DESC>NA AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY Sensors Directorate ELECTROMAGNETICS TECHNOLOGY DIVISION (AFRL/SNH) RESEARCH INTERESTS A.  INTRODUCTION 	This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Electromagnetics Technology Division of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/SNH) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Awards for proposals submitted in response to this BAA are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provision of PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  For purposes of this announcement, basic research (6.1) is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge and understanding related to long term national security needs rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  It provides part of the base for subsequent exploratory (6.2) and advanced (6.3) developments in defense related technologies.  Under this BAA 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 proposals are solicited. 	AFRL/SNH contracts with educational institutions, non profit organizations, and private industry for electromagnetics research.  This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to the Division.  Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to the Electromagnetics Technology Division are encouraged to not only carefully peruse this BAA, but to contact the appropriate scientist identified in this publication as well, to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/SNH may have in a specific research project. 	The program is organized by scientific discipline, and the reader will note some overlap between sections.  The research areas described may have short or long-range impact on Air Force capabilities.  Typical research programs sponsored by AFRL/SNH vary in length from 12 to 30 months and require from 1 to 6 total man-years to complete.  If progress in certain areas requires several investigators, and especially if an interdisciplinary approach is necessary, AFRL will consider proposals for more comprehensive research programs.  Only a small number of such large programs can be initiated in a single fiscal year.  Inquiries related to comprehensive and interdisciplinary programs should be sent to the AFRL/SNH Division Chief. 	Proposals may be submitted at any time.  We strongly encourage informal discussion and submission of a brief outline of the proposed research (white paper) prior to the submission of a formal proposal.  Key AFRL staff members for each area of interest are identified in the description of that area.  To contact AFRL/SNH staff members by mail, write to the following address, using the appropriate branch symbol: 				Air Force Research Laboratory /(BRANCH SYMBOL) 				80 Scott Drive 				Hanscom AFB MA 01731-2909 B.  MISSION 	 The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) leads the discovery, development, and timely transition of affordable, integrated technologies that keep our Air Force the best in the world.  AFRL is organized into ten technology directorates.  The Electromagnetics Technology Division (AFRL/SNH) at Hanscom AFB MA is part of AFRL's Sensors Directorate, whose mission is to ensure unequaled reconnaissance, surveillance, precision engagement, and electronic warfare capabilities for America's air and space forces by conceiving, demonstrating, and transitioning advanced sensors and sensor technologies in partnership with industry, universities and other DoD agencies, as well as providing knowledgeable support to both the acquisition community and warfighters.  The Electromagnetics Technology Division, in turn, conducts basic research, exploratory development, and advanced development programs to meet Air Force systems needs for air, space, and C2 applications in electromagnetics, and in related electronic and electro-optics technologies.  AFRL/SNH explores the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from deep ultraviolet to microwaves, to satisfy growing war-fighter needs by providing cost effective performance options. C.  RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS 	To support the mission of AFRL/SNH, research is required in the areas described below. a. ANTENNA TECHNOLOGY The objective of this program is to advance the understanding of array and multiple beam antennas for manned aircraft, UAV's, and both ground- and space-based platforms.  The program encompasses several areas of major activity dealing with fundamental electromagnetics, array control, active array architecture, antenna measurements, and array affordability. Crucial electromagnetic issues include radiation patterns and mutual coupling of antenna elements in arrays, the analysis of antennas conformal to vehicle or support structures, the analysis of printed circuit array elements, and the development of new types of radiators for increased bandwidth or multiple frequency radiation.  The program is concerned with many issues of antenna control.  It deals with digital beamforming, optical distribution of phasing and control signals, novel concepts for limited-scan arrays, and adaptive or intelligent means of aperture control for null steering, local failure detection, compensation, and correction in very large phased arrays including the use of both expert systems and neural networks. Multifunction, multifrequency, reconfigurable arrays for aircraft that can be made a structural part of the aircraft skin need to be understood. Major efforts within the program address the architectural aspects of array fabrication with active amplifiers.  At SHF and EHF frequencies the primary concern is to employ active devices to enhance array control by using amplitude control as well as phase control.  This added flexibility may eliminate the use of hard-wired beamformers and, in addition, may improve the null steering capabilities of adaptive arrays.  The program seeks advances in antenna front-end technology to achieve low cost, low loss, lightweight, compact antenna control over the spectrum from microwave to terahertz frequencies.  Of particular interest is the development of microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices, with the goal of reducing the size, weight, and power (SWAP) requirements for large phased arrays.  The effort exploits new materials and new device, and component concepts for lower loss in passive circuits, higher efficiency in active circuits, higher levels of integration, and expanded performance capabilities.  Key antenna architectural issues include the minimization of required via holes, thermal design, bandwidth enhancement, and multi-layer board integration of control and microwave distribution circuits.  Antenna measurement topics of interest include the measurement of very large apertures which are either so large that one cannot make far field measurements, so non-rigid as not to be self-supporting in the earth's gravity field, or so large that funding limitations prohibit assembling the complete antenna structure.  In each of these cases, there is a need to predict and validate the antenna performance to -60dB levels.   Point of Contact:  LIVIO D. POLES, AFRL/SNHA, Tel 781-377-4087, email: livio.poles@hanscom.af.mil. b.  ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING FROM TARGETS AND TERRAIN 	This research is concerned with the scattering of electromagnetic energy from 1) bodies of arbitrary size, shape, and composition, and 2) a wide variety of terrain types representative of real earth.  Frequencies of interest range from 3 MHz to 300 GHz.  Areas of interest include the calculation of scattering cross-sections from arbitrary multi-wavelength conducting, coated, or penetrable bodies.  Also of interest are high-resolution-radar, bistatic radar phenomena, including depolarization, and the statistical description of bistatic data.  Research is conducted towards the development of algorithms that will allow the integration of phenomenological data from multiple sources for improved detection and identification of difficult targets.  The effect of target and clutter depolarization on the signal to clutter ratio is also of interest.  The target program consists of both theory and measurements. The terrain program seeks research which provides the necessary understanding to formulate predictive models of scattering from a variety of terrain, especially when covered with foliage and vegetation; the collection of data that have been calibrated absolutely; and the analysis of the effects of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and terrain on the performance of radar systems.  The effects of clutter reduction using polarization diversity are also being studied. The effect of clutter cell size on the statistics of the scattered waves in high-resolution, and bistatic radar systems is under investigation.  A comprehensive understanding of statistical behavior of scattering phenomenology is required for the development and validation of models to enhance the performance of adaptive signal processing algorithms with respect to reducing the number of adaptive degrees of freedom, sample support, and computational cost required to suppress clutter.  Issues of importance are robust performance in fiercely non-stationary environments with emphasis on CFAR. Results obtained, for both target and clutter situations, will be used in the design, development, and evaluation of future space-based and airborne radar systems, and for improved detection and target identification in existing radar systems operating against ground-based targets and low-observable airborne targets in a dense clutter environment.   Point of Contact:  BERTUS WEIJERS, AFRL/SNHE, Tel 781-377-1733, email: bertus.weijers@hanscom.af.mil c.  OPTRONICS COMPONENTS and ALGORITMS 	This effort is concerned with basic research and exploratory development of advanced performance optronic components, subsystems, and algorithms for Air Force "space and air" image restoration/recognition, multispectral detection and non-cooperative ID, target tracking, threat warning and countermeasures, missile guidance, and high bandwidth communications/data-network systems.  The emphasis will be on integrable components and technologies in the III-V and group IV materials systems. This includes indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and their alloys.  This does not exclude other technologies or materials systems such as fiber-based devices, organic semiconductors, and non linear optical (NLO) materials, waveguides, and devices.  In addition, new heterogeneous devices and integration techniques offering functional performance beyond the capability of similar homogeneous devices in any material system will be considered.  Of particular interest is component research using, for example, fusion and lift-off or other techniques that provide process compatibility for the integration of high performance state-of-the-art components for space applications without performance degradation.  Other categories include pattern recognition algorithms and architectures, spatial light modulators, and the development of new nonlinear optical materials and the optimization of existing materials. In the category of new nonlinear optical materials, the goal is to provide a material which simultaneously has sub-millisecond response times, high optical efficiency, and low laser power density requirements.  Emphasis is on materials that can be made to work well at visible and IR laser wavelengths.  Research in this category can include, for example, photorefractive materials such as BaTiO3 or bandgap engineered materials such as multiple quantum wells. Also of interest are materials that can transfer wavefront information between visible and non-visible electromagnetic waves, for example, visibl e and infrared.  In the optical signal processing category, we want functions that work in real time.  This can include research into new techniques for performing operations such as correlation, convolution noise removal, edge enhancement, image multiplexing, and optical storage. Point of Contact:  JOSEPH P. LORENZO, AFRL/SNHC, Tel 781-377-2234, email: joseph.lorenzo@hanscom.af.mil. d.  IMAGE EXPLOITATION OF INFRARED CAMERAS Our activities in this area have ranged from the study of metal silicides as infrared photo detectors, to fabrication of complete IR sensor systems, to field testing of cameras, to the development of algorithms for special purpose applications.  Recent emphasis is to exploit and extend the applications addressed by modern staring infrared cameras through image/signal processing algorithm development and prototype hardware implementations.  The major research areas are: development of image/signal processing algorithms for IR image enhancement; algorithms for the detection/tracking of unresolved targets in clutter in consecutive frame IR imagery; and algorithms for hyperspectral data acquisition, data reconstruction, and analysis.  In-house-developed thermal infrared sensors and hyperspectral imagers support the research and hinge the algorithm work very closely to real-world data. Image and signal processing algorithms for image exploitation applications with large format infrared arrays must meet the challenge of real-time operation.  Key applications involve the extraction of information from IR imagery such as through spectral discrimination, point target detection/tracking, range determination, etc.  Improved understanding and control of the effects of noise and ground and cloud clutter and studies on how staring arrays behave in various environments such as on moving platforms are important auxiliary topics to address in conjunction with the algorithm development.

The contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain, and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will govern the operation and maintenance contract(s).  Transfers of property and grants of access are authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2688.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Rights of Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP and grants access to the system(s).

The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: Pillar Point AFS, California, electric, potable water, and wastewater utility systems support a base population of approximately 30 people..

Pillar Point AFS, located on the north edge of Half Moon Bay, California, is an AFSPC installation that supports research and development tests and launch range operations for DoD, USAF, and NASA space, ballistic missile, and aeronautical systems and commercial space launches.  Pillar Point occupies 56 acres.

The following information provided is only an estimate of the size, scope and general description of the electrical, potable water and wastewater utility systems at the base and is subject to changes.  

ELECTRICAL POWER is provided by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E.)  The system is capable of supporting projected future demands for electrical power without new construction.  There is a pole-mounted switch near the entrance to the site, and that pole is the transition point to the underground system on site.  The 12.47 KV line goes from the takeoff pole to an enclosed substation consisting of two 750 KVA transformers with a low side voltage of 480V.  There are four 500KW diesel generators with output of 480V which are not included in the inventory to be privatized.

POTABLE WATER SYSTEM has less than 5,000 linear feet and 70,000 gallons above ground storage tank to provide fire flow.  Two small electric pumps and a pressure tank provide system pressure.  The supplier of water to the site is Coastside County Water District.

WASTEWATER SYSTEMS are available to be privatized at the Pillar Point Site and consist of three septic tanks and multiple leach pits, and one 2000-gallon holding tank that is pumped as needed.  The wastewater lines are of original construction, material unknown but likely to be clay.

21 CONS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Pillar Point AFS on or about 5 April 2004.  Any question concerning this effort, please contact Ben Chaib, Contracting Officer, at ben.chaibb@peterson.af.mil

These reports will be primarily based on 5 visitor surveys administered by the Contractor at the National Archives Building, Washington, D.C., over a two year period.  Visitors will be surveyed following the opening of each new component of the National Archives Experience (NAE) to take advantage of this unique opportunity to determine how each new venue changes behaviors and attitudes, especially corresponding to length of stay, visitor satisfaction, and visitor priorities. The results of the survey will be used to make adjustments in our service offerings that will improve the overall visitor experience.
The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provides public programming at the National Archives Building in Washington, DC.  Over the next two years a number of new venues will open, which are designed to enhance the visitors’ experience and are collectively referred to as the NAE. The NAE encompasses all of the general visitor venues in the National Archives Building in Washington, DC, but excludes the research facilities in that building.  The NAE includes the following elements to be surveyed according to the dates below:
The Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom (opened September 17, 2003)
The William G. McGowan Theater at the National Archives (opening September 2004)
The Public Vaults (permanent exhibit, opening November 2004)
The Learning Center (opening Winter 2005)
Special Exhibition Gallery (first traveling exhibit opening Fall 2005)

The contract awarded as a result of this RFQ will be a Firm-Fixed Price supply contract. The contract is for the supply of possibly 6 statistical analysis reports that would be delivered over a period of approximately 2 calendar years. The requirement is a 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541910 and the Small Business Size Standard is $6 million. All responsible small business sources may submit a quote that will be considered by NARA.

<DESC>The objective of this effort is to create a center to exploit the capabilities of Hawaii- based small business firms in performing high technology efforts related to current and future U.S. Navy programs.  The results of the effort will be a stronger technology base in Hawaii for meeting U.S. Navy technology requirements. 

The center will be responsible for identifying opportunities where Hawaii- based small businesses possess the technological expertise to perform research into technologies to meet existing and future naval requirements.  These efforts will include the identification of opportunities to apply existing technologies developed by Hawaii- based small businesses to meet U.S. Navy needs (so called “spin-on” technologies).  The center shall also provide information on existing U.S. Navy technologies to which Hawaii- based small businesses may gain access for purposes of commercialization (so called “spin-off” technologies).

A major effort of the center will be outreach activities to Hawaii- based small businesses and the U.S. Navy to ensure that appropriate opportunities for research participation; and technology application are identified.   Efforts to assist Hawaii- based small businesses in understanding the business, financial, and technical aspects of applying for and performing such efforts will also be within the center’s responsibilities. 

Proposals are sought from organizations with extensive knowledge of the capabilities of Hawaii- based small businesses and U.S. Navy technology requirements.  Experience in the mentoring of small business high technology firms, especially in relation to the performance of Government- sponsored research and technology development efforts, is desired.

<DESC>The Philippines faces significant challenges in managing its diverse and valuable natural resources, which support the lives and livelihoods of the Filipino people. During the last 50 years, the country’s natural resource base has been severely degraded due to overfishing, destructive fishing practices, illegal logging and conversion of natural forests.   Similarly, only a small percentage of the country’s solid waste is collected, and only 3 sanitary landfills exist today. Heavily polluted water has severely affected environmental quality and public health; close to 31% of reported illnesses during 1996-2000 were related to water-borne disease. This situation is ultimately a result of ineffective governance which, in turn, results in de facto open access to natural resources.  Open access allows exploitation of resources, corruption and conflict that perpetuates poverty and marginalization of communities, particularly those most directly dependent upon the natural resource base.  

Designed to conserve biological diversity by addressing open access and mitigating natural resource-based conflicts in priority ecoregions, the Environmental Governance Phase 2 (EcoGov2) Project will strengthen the capacities of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), local government units (LGUs) and local institutions to sustainably manage forest, coastal-marine and water resources and promote integrated solid waste management by LGUs, through effective governance. This will also include reviewing and recommending for adoption policies on improved environmental governance, assisting local institutions to mobilize financial resources to implement environmental management projects, enhancing capacity of local and national bodies to enforce environmental laws and strengthening institutions to generate greater political will to support better environmental governance. This Project will build on the experience and results of the current EcoGov Project, and transition from planning and training to implementation. The Project will be implemented in conflict affected areas of the country, with a focus on biologically important ecoregions of Western and Southern Mindanao, Central Visayas, and northern Luzon.  

Targeted to begin on or before October 1, 2004, the contract to support the implementation of the EcoGov2 Project will have a base of five years with an option to extend for two years.  By the seventh year, EcoGov 2 Project would have assisted 100 government institutions in meeting good environmental governance benchmark index, placed 300,000 hectares of forest cover and 5,114 hectares of coastal areas under improved management, established 160 marine sanctuaries covering 4,185 hectares, strengthened the management of 75 marine sanctuaries covering 975 hectares, increased to 25% recycling and composting rates in 100 LGUs and supported 26 LGUs to invest in sanitation facilities.

USAID anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursable completion contract beginning on October 1, 2004 for the base of five years and the option of two years.  Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP documents that will be available on or about March 24, 2004 on this website. The closing date for the submission of the proposals, to be specified in the RFP, will be about 60 days thereafter.  To obtain the RFP, send your written requests to the Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, PSC 502 BOX #1, FPO AP 96515, or Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, 8/F PNB Financial Center, Roxas Blvd. 1308 Pasay City, Philippines.  You may also send your requests by e-mail to marenas@usaid.gov referencing the above RFP.  Our telephone nos. are (632) 552-9926 and (632) 552-9924.  Our fax nos. are (632) 551-9297 and (632) 552-9999. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet.  By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5" floppy disk (MS WordXP format), via e-mail, or in hard copy.  The notice can be viewed and downloaded using this website.  The solicitation, once issued, can also be downloaded from this website.  You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing in general, and from overseas Missions, in particular. 

As the recipient of this solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from the Internet in its entirety.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.  Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you downloaded the solicitation.  Generally, the Contracting Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt.  However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet.  You are therefore advised to regularly check the FedBizOps website (http://www.fedbizops.gov/) for amendments.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisitions Procedures, a firm fixed/time and material award to Academy Health, 1801 K Street, NW, Suite 701-L, Washington, DC  20006 for the Chronically Ill Medicare Beneficiary Research, Data, Demonstration Strategy. The purpose of this contract is to provide expert technical assistance in a meeting with researchers, health plan officials, and clinicians to fulfill the statutory mandate for consultations in section 723© of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Modernization, and Improvement Act.  The contractor shall also prepare a model background briefing book, and paper, suitable for public release, regarding the consultation meeting. The contractor should have knowledge of CMS data systems, chronic disease demonstrations, chronic disease research and issues surrounding improving the care of the chronically ill Medicare population.  Academy Health is the nation’s foremost membership organization of health services researchers, economists, and clinicians.  The Academy sponsors original research through grants from a variety of foundations including the Health Care Financing and Organization grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and sponsors annual meetings such as the Health Policy Conference in January in Washington DC where the nation’s leading health policymakers gather to discuss the annual health agenda facing the Congress as well as an annual research meeting where the nation’s foremost health services researchers gather to discuss the most recent research findings.  Academy Health convenes meetings on policy relevant topics with nationally recognized experts in the fields of health services research, health plan data experts, and clinicians on a regular basis.  They have a national reputation for bringing relevant information to bear on key health policy topics in an objective manner. Academy Health staff have expertise in designing, conducting, and evaluating CMS demonstrations generally and specifically those focused on chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries.  Academy Health staff have expertise in designing CMS demonstrations to both improve the quality of care for the chronically ill Medicare population as well as reducing the cost of that care.  There have been numerous studies showing the burden of chronic illness on the elderly, the gaps in coordination of care for the chronically ill, and best practices in the private sector in terms of disease and case management.  The CMS demonstrations’ program draws upon this literature and is seeking to translate these successes to the Medicare program.  Academy Health staff have expertise working with a number of outside researchers, clinicians, and health plan data experts in developing CMS demonstration programs.  
This project requires the convening of nationally respected experts in the fields of health policy research, health data, and clinical care of the chronically ill Medicare population.  Academy Health is the premier health policy/research organization and convenes meetings of the type requested here on an ongoing basis.  Academy Health maintains an active roster of specialists in fields such as health services research, clinicians, economists and others with expertise in the care of the chronically ill.  Academy Health would plan the technical aspects of the meeting providing advice on:  who to invite, how to structure the agenda, produce background briefing books and send them to invitees in advance, facilitate the meeting, prepare a publicly releasable report on the meeting that would include highlights of the presentations, discussion, and recommendations.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.  In addition, all contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.

<SUBJECT>S -- Utilities Privatization of Electric, Water and Wastewater Systems at Fort Belvoir
<SOLNBR>SP0600-04-R-0047

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric distribution system, the water distribution system and the wastewater collection system at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, a firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  
The Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation: Fort Belvoir
Location: Fort Belvoir, Virginia
Installation Description: Located in Fairfax County, near Alexandria, Virginia, Fort Belvoir covers approximately 8,600 acres.  Fort Belvoir’s daytime population is estimated to include more than 12,000 personnel: 3,000 active duty military personnel and 9,000 civilians.
Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.	Water Distribution System:
Fort Belvoir is supplied with potable water from the Fairfax County Water Authority (FCWA). Other than chlorination of water on an as needed basis, there is no water treatment at Fort Belvoir. Fort Belvoir’s potable water distribution system connects to FCWA’s main at four locations and there is one supply point that is dedicated to the Golf Course Maintenance Facility (Building 2990).
The potable water distribution system consists of pipe sizes ranging from less than 2 inches to 30 inches. The total length of the pipes is approximately 446,667 linear feet.  The water pipes are at an average depth of 3 to 4 feet. There are four water storage tanks. All tanks are of steel construction installed in 1948. The valves and piping at the tanks were upgraded in 1994. The tanks were stripped of lead paint and repainted in 1995 and 1996.

b.	Wastewater Collection System 
Fort Belvoir’s wastewater collection system includes 34 lift stations and approximately 389,122 feet of pipe/force mains. There is no wastewater treatment facility at the Base. All the wastewater is conveyed to Fairfax County Department of Public Works (FCDPW) for treatment. The wastewater is metered at seven location and flows into FCDPW’s mains at six connection points.
The sizes of collection pipes range from 4 inches in diameter to 24 inches in diameter with the majority of the pipe size being 8 inches, as summarized in Table 1. The large majority of the pipe is PVC type. Also, within the sewer collection system are 1,173 manholes. Most of the wastewater collection system was constructed between the 1940s and the 1990s, with only replacement and upgrade work being completed since 1997. The upgrade work included relining of pipes, upgrading of manholes, and some pipe replacement. 
There are 34 lift stations and associated force mains within the wastewater collection system at Belvoir. The length of the associated force mains is summarized in Table 1. Figures 3.1.2.1.a through 3.1.2.1.f depict several of the lift stations and their components.
Wastewater is collected at the Woodlawn Village housing area by gravity flow pipes, metered and transferred to FCDPW main. Wastewater from HQ DLA is metered at the Accotink and Route No. 1 and flows into FCDPW main. At the same location there is another flow meter and line, which conveys wastewater from the Airfield. Wastewater collected from other buildings north of Route No. 1, is metered and flows into FCDPW main at Guston Road and Route No. 1. Wastewater collected from buildings located south of Route No. 1 flows to Lift Station 687 or to Lift Station 97. Both of these lift stations replaced old wastewater treatment plants at Ft. Belvoir in the early 1980s. The holding tanks of the old wastewater treatment plant are still used. The pumps in the lift stations were installed to take the wastewater treatment plants out of service and transfer the wastewater to FCDPW main. Both the lift stations have wastewater meters. 

c.	Electrical Distribution System 
The primary distribution system consists of a total of approximately 90 circuit miles of 4.16 kV, 12.5 kV, 22.9 kV, and 34.5 kV circuits.  The majority of the distribution circuits are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits.  The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (which is conventional, open wire/wood crossarm construction) with pole-mounted transformer banks.  However, there is also a substantial amount of underground primary construction, utilizing both direct burial and duct type construction practices.
Fort Belvoir currently purchases bulk electrical power at 34.5 kV from Dominion Virginia Power (DVP) at Substation 2540 (Humphrey's Substation), located near the northeast corner of the base.
Fort Belvoir owns and operates an electrical utility system consisting of:
·	Four 34.5 kV subtransmission switching stations
·	One 34.5 – 22.9 kV subtransmission substation
·	Eight 4.16 kV distribution substations
·	One 12.5 kV distribution substation
·	Approximately 70 circuit miles of overhead primary distribution line
·	Approximately 19 circuit miles of underground primary distribution line
The electrical utility system consists of two 34.5 kV feeders supplying four 34.5 kV overhead feeders.  The 34.5 kV feeders serve as both distribution supply circuits and as sub-transmission circuits supplying one 34.5 - 22.9 kV sub-transmission substation, four 4.16 kV distribution substations, and one 12.5 kV distribution substation.

Description

DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the water distribution system and the wastewater collection system at Sierra Army Depot, California.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  
The Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation: Sierra Army Depot
Location: Sierra Army Depot, California
Installation Description:  Sierra Army Depot (SIAD) is located in sparsely populated Lassen County in northeast California, approximately forty miles southeast of Susanville and fifty-five miles northwest of Reno, Nevada.
Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.	Water Distribution System:
The SIAD water treatment and distribution system was generally constructed between 1943 and 1960, and expanded during the 1970s.  The existing system may include, but is not limited to wells, mains, pump stations, elevated and ground level tanks, services, hydrants, valves, and appurtenances. In general, the system is of advanced age, although individual components have been replaced over time as part of routine maintenance. The distribution system is composed of various types of pipes ranging in size from two to fourteen inches in diameter.  All raw water comes from four deep wells located within the main cantonment area, ranging in depth 350-550 feet below ground surface. Water from the wells is chlorinated at each of the wellheads. The SIAD water supply is under the jurisdiction of the California State Department of Health Services, Public Water Supply Branch.  

There is one ground storage reservoir on the existing SIAD water system, capacity: 1,250,000 gallons. The bottom and sides of the reservoir are constructed of concrete.  A 1.5” to 8” concrete topping was added to the bottom to correct the drainage slope, reducing the capacity to approximately 1.2 million gallons.  This ground storage has a flexible EPDM rubber cover, which is in poor condition.  Chlorine is also added to the water at the reservoir.  It is likely that this tank has a significant buildup of solids due to the extended period of time since it has been cleaned and to the high levels of iron and manganese in the system.

There are three elevated storage tanks in the system.  They were constructed in the late 1950s or early 1960s.  In general, the exterior of these tanks appear to be in fair condition. However, they have had very little maintenance performed and are all in need of complete rehabilitation, particularly on the inside. 
Tank   #1: 					           Capacity:	   125,000 gallons
Tank   #2: 					           Capacity:	     40,000 gallons
Tank   #3: 					           Capacity:	     60,000 gallons
Available SIAD records indicate that the exterior of the tanks were painted in 1982 using a lead-based paint system. Drawings are also available showing a planned interior paint project for the same period of time. However, since records of this project are not available, it is not clear what work was actually performed.  In either case, the coatings on the tanks likely have lead based paint.

b.	Wastewater Collection System 
The SIAD existing wastewater system was constructed in the early 1940s and it is composed of two independent wastewater collection systems. Both systems consist of a series of gravity-fed collection pipelines and laterals with one intermediate lift station. The larger system serves the Cantonment Area as well as the West Patton Village Community Service District (WPVCSD) Area. It is comprised primarily of vitrified clay pipes raging in size from four to fifteen inches in diameter. Most mains are in the six to twelve inches diameter range. The smaller system serves the Eastern Warehouse Area. It is also comprised primarily of vitrified clay pipes, with most mains in the six to eight inches diameter size. All effluent is collected into mains and then routed to two sewage treatment lagoons. The lagoons for the Cantonment area were constructed in 1954 and upgraded in 1965, 1993, 1996, and 2003. The main system consists of three main cells and one two-acre polishing pond constructed in late 1997. The lagoons for the warehouse system were built in 1972. The treatment facility has a capacity of 5,000 gallons per day.
Below is the description of the system and its inventory. They are included in this section to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the bidder’s library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the inventory description. Under no circumstances shall the successful Contractor be entitled to any rate adjustments based on the accuracy of the stated system description and inventory.

There are two existing wastewater treatment facilities at SIAD.  The smaller of the two systems serves only the warehouse area of SIAD.  This plant is an anaerobic lagoon system.  The plant currently operates with two primary ponds.  Each pond is approximately 1 acre in area with a 3-4 foot liquid depth.  Flow is expected to completely evaporate from this system, with no discharge.  The flow meter is a Sigma model 950 with a bubbler level sensor.  
The large wastewater plant uses a facultative lagoon process with discharge to a set of three wetland cells.  Four wetland cells are present, but the plant design is currently approved using three. Currently, the system operates with a lagoon that is aerated by floating surface aerators, followed by an anaerobic polishing pond.  One of the cells is a newly active cell with a bentonite natural liner and newly planted wetland vegetation.  The other two cells will be used as overflow cells to accommodate temporary increase flows.  Two new transfer pumps from the polishing pond to the wetlands was installed in 2003.  The flow meter is a Sigma model 950 with an electronic level sensor.
The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the wastewater system.


The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Douglas Smith at 703-767-9409 to be added to our bidder mailing list.

Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Room 3830, Fort Belvoir, Virginia 22060-6222

Description

DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the water distribution system and the wastewater collection system at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  
The Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation: Fort A.P. Hill
Location: Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia
Installation Description:  Fort A. P. Hill (APH) is located approximately 80 miles south of Washington D.C., Fort A.P. Hill is a U.S. Army Installation serving every component of the U.S. Armed Forces, active and reserve, and several other agencies of the U.S. Government including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the State Department.
Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.	Water Distribution System:
The potable water utility system at APH is composed of eight independent components including; Headquarter Areas, Central Camp, Cooke Camp, Pender Camp, and Rappahannock sites.  Wilcox, Archer, and Anderson area potable water systems are stand-alone, but can be connected to the Headquarters Area system when needed.  The water distribution systems consist of water wells, chlorination disinfection systems, booster pumps, water storage tanks, water mains, fire hydrants, isolation valves, air release valves and service lines.  
A unique requirement of the APH potable water system is to accommodate the National Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Jamboree that has been held at APH every four years since 1981. The actual BSA Jamboree lasts for only 10 days, but takes months to prepare the potable water system to accommodate the potable water demands from the Jamboree’s enormous attendance. It is estimated that APH hosts approximately 30,000 boy scouts and nearly 300,000 visitors during the Jamboree.
Water Sources
Water sources for Fort A.P. Hill are the Aquia, Middle and Lower Potomac aquifers. There are 25 active wells that draw water from the aquifers and supply the distribution systems.

The water systems within APH provide water for both domestic and fire protection use. With few exceptions, lines are located adjacent to roadways and fire hydrants readily accessible and each fire hydrant has its own isolation valve. Isolation valves are located near most pipe intersections making it easy to isolate portions of the system. The normal distribution pressure is approximately 54 pounds per square inch (psi) and is adequate for fire protection.

The water distribution system consists of pipes size raging from 1 to 24 inches. The total length of the pipe is approximately 256,00 linear feet.


b.	Wastewater Collection System 
The wastewater collection system at APH consists of gravity lines, equalization basins, lift stations and force mains that transport the wastewater generated to treatment facilities.  The wastewater collection system at APH can be divided into two sections.  The Main Cantonment section includes the areas where generated wastewater flows to the Wilcox Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) for treatment.  The second section includes the outlying areas where the wastewater treatment occurs within the specific area.  

Equalization Basins
Some of the areas within the Main Cantonment have equalization basins.  The basins are located near lift stations and their primary purpose is to store flows to the lift station that are greater than the pump capacity.  When the flow to the lift station is greater than the lift station pump capacity, the excess flow is transferred to the equalization basins.  When the flow to the lift station is less than lift stations pump capacity and if there is any wastewater in the equalization basin, the wastewater flows by gravity from the basin to the lift station.  Some of the basins have aeration to keep particles in suspension.  The aeration does provide treatment and assists in reducing the potential for hydrogen sulfide development


The wastewater generated at Main Cantonment area facilities flow to gravity collections lines, then on to a lift station where it is pumped to other gravity collection lines and eventually on to the Wilcox Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  The plant is located in the southeast portion of APH. Only a small portion of the wastewater generated at APH flows by gravity directly to the WWTP.  
The sub-areas that make up the Main Cantonment area are: Mahone, Jackson, HETH, Davis, Lake Travis, Rodes, Longstreet, Wilcox, Archer ASP, Anderson Headquarters and Naval Area. 
The wastewater collection system in the Main Cantonment area consists of pipes size raging from less than 4 to 12-inches. The total length of the pipe is 30.3 miles with approximately 380 manholes. 

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Doug Smith at 703-767-9409 to be added to our bidder mailing list.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Sources are sought to identify firms capable of providing management, technical expertise, supervision, tools, equipment, supplies, labor and quality control necessary to provide data evaluation support services to the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), Reactor Products Program (RPP).   AFTAC/RPP provides national authorities with quality data analysis and technical evaluations on nuclear treaty compliance. The anticipated contract requires proficiency in nuclear engineering/physics, statistics, atmospheric modeling/analysis, and computer software design and maintenance.  Nuclear expertise supports data collection, analysis, quality assurance, and evaluation requirements. Atmospheric modeling expertise supports operation and maintenance of a suite of government owned and commercial off-the-shelf atmospheric models. The majority of work is done off-site but some on-site support at Patrick AFB, FL will be required. Contractor presence in the local area is required to provide a responsive framework for adapting or modifying technologies to enhance mission effectiveness.

Nuclear data analysis begins with quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) throughout a radionuclide laboratory network. This includes checking data for trends and biases within and between laboratories and reporting findings via reports and meetings. The contractor will be required to employ industry accepted quality control techniques to analyze data from standard laboratory analysis of pay samples to include statistical analysis of mass spectrometry blind standards in order to provide an evaluation of laboratory performance and analytical studies to diagnose QA problems associated with laboratory processes or measurement techniques. Meteorological data support includes processing, preprocessing, visualization and other analysis techniques. Oracle database technology is used for both nuclear and meteorological databases. All models and analysis tools function in an integrated environment.

It is anticipated that the effort will only involve elements of operational support.  The contractor will be required to maintain a configuration management (CM) program for effective operation and maintenance of the RPP Data Evaluation System (DES). The CM will include the integration and updating of meteorological, statistical, data management, and other analytical tools in the RPP analysis and evaluation process. In addition, the contractor must identify, evaluate, test, implement, and document approved changes for operational systems. 

Operational support will involve: The operation and maintenance of numerous in-house systems developed for AFTAC's unique mission (see attachment 1 to this notice).  The complexity of supporting these systems requires the contractor to have, at a minimum, expertise in hardware and software CM and systems integration experience on SUN, SGI, NT, and LINUX Cluster architectures. Software expertise in Fortran (family), C (family), ADA, and Java languages is mandatory.  .

Contractor personnel will require DoD security clearances at least at the TOP SECRET/SCI level for key personnel.  Handling of material up to TOP SECRET/SCI is required. Storage and Facility clearances of at least the TOP SECRET/SCI level are required.  

This sources-sought synopsis is an invitation for all qualified sources that contemplate submitting a proposal under a future RFP for this requirement to identify themselves.  Sources should submit a brief capabilities statement in response to this notice.  Responses must be limited to no more that 3 pages and should breifly address the following specific areas:

1.  The clearance level of personnel working on the proposed contract.
2.  The capabilities of personnel relating to nuclear laboratory operations, laboratory and meteorlogical QA/QC experience, atmospheric mesoscale modeling, atmospheric transport and dispersion modeling, statistics, nuclear physics/engineering.
3.  Business size/status.
4.  A yardstick estimate of time required from receipt of all computer code until full performance capability is achieved – an estimate of required phase-in time.  This notice is not a synopsis or request for proposal, but is a request for information for planning purposes.  No obligation will be infered from information offered.

A cost plus fixed fee contract is contemplated with a 1 year period of performance.  It is anticipated that this requirement will be fulfilled after October of 2005 as part of a larger contract.  This contract will be for a one year period after the expiration of the current contract and prior to award of the anticipated larger contract.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.  Responses may be mailed to 45CONS/LGCCB, Attn: James Loeffler, 1030 S. HWY A1A, Bldg 989, MS 1000, Patrick AFB, FL, 32925-3002.  Responses may also be e-mailed to james.loeffler@patrick.af.mil.  Questions may also be e-mailed to this address.  Responses are due no later than 12 March 2003.

<DESC>The purchase description has been posted at this site. The solicitation will be posted at a later date.  A best value basic source selection procedure will be used. Past performance information will be required. 



This requirement is for the purchase of Precision Air Data Standard (PADS).  PADS are intended to calibrate high performance air data test sets (ADTS) and other devices in the air data range.  This item fills requirements currently addressed by mercury manometers and/or piston gauges.  The requirements of the PADS are based on maintaining the manufacturer's specified ADTS measurement uncertainty with automated operation.  To meet these objectives, the system does not require facilities beyond the conditions found in a conventional Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) and its operation is fully automated, to the extent supported by the test instrument (TI).  The PADS is an integrated, bench mounted calibration system covering the range of 0.3 to 110 in Hg with both absolute and gauge mode operation.  Operation is fully automated, including setting individual on demand pressure points as well as multi-point calibration sequences and data acquisition and remote control of a capable TI (i.e. TI has an RS232 or IEEE-488 interface and command structure).  The PADS operator interface is through a dedicated system controller with flat screen display, keyboard and pointing device.  AFMETCAL Det1 intends to award a commercial order utilizing best value basic source selection and simplified acquisition procedures under FAR part 12 and 13. The basic order quantity will be for 1 each, additional data, and a 5-year extended warranty will be required.  An FY-05 option for an additional quantity of 0-4 each, and an FY-06 option for 0-4 each will also be included.  Unit test will be required.  Units will be shipped to PMEL locations.  Option quantities will be tested at the PMELS.  Delivery shall be FOB destination.  The solicitation is anticipated to be issued approximately 24 Feb 2004, with a due date of 24 Mar 2004.  The solicitation package including purchase description will be posted at this site.  A complete technical proposal will be required. To be eligible for award, offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as factors or subfactors.

The servers will functionally replicate approximately thirty five (35) IBM RS/6000 UNIX (AIX) servers of varying age, capacity, and capability that comprise the operational infrastructure of the Gateway Server Center (GSC), a subset of the NWSTG.  Functional replication of all applications currently operating on GSC servers is essential to the implementation of the NWSTG Backup System and thereby essential for NWS to achieve critical infrastructure protection.

NWS OCIO is seeking varied concepts and innovative approaches to achieve functional replication of the GSC servers.  The proposed solutions must support without modification all of the GSC software applications currently executed under the AIX (V4.3/V5.1) operating system as well as currently implemented COTS application to include AFS, IBM EdgeServer, and Sybase. Flexibility through server consolidation and dynamic resource allocation, partitioning, scalability, reliability through fault avoidance, and compactness are also necessary attributes for the optimal solution.  

A complete list of the current servers that must be functionally replicated is attached as Appendix A.  The proposed solution must provide equivalent or better aggregate performance for the servers listed. 

In order to fulfill the objective of acquiring the servers in FY2004, NWS OCIO will utilize established GSA schedules and/or other Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) as appropriate.  

One of the principal outcomes of RFI responses will be to ensure that all viable technical approaches are considered.  NWS OCIO will consider input received in response to this RFI as it continues to develop its acquisition strategy to take into account viable acquisition alternatives. NWS OCIO may conduct one-on-one communications in an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI.
 
In addition to using the information provided by vendors to assist us in our acquisition strategy, NWS OCIO may also use the information to determine which vendors do not appear to be viable candidates for the eventual acquisition award.  However, if those vendors choose to remain in the competition and later submit proposals, the Team will not be prejudiced by its initial determination.  Any vendor that requests, will receive a written or oral explanation of the Team's initial determination as it pertains to that vendor.  

It is not the Government's intent to disclose vendor proprietary information and trade secrets to the public.  The information submitted by vendors during the pre-solicitation period may be used by the Government in preparing its acquisition strategy provided this can be done without disclosing proprietary vendor information that is protected from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations.

Interested vendors should respond in writing to the following topics:

(a) A description of a proposed hardware configuration that provides computational capability and network throughput equivalent to the servers listed in Appendix A.  The description must address how the proposed system will meet NWSTG Backup GSC performance requirements.

(b) A description of the support services which will be provided to install, configure, and maintain the  
	 NWSTG Backup GSC.

(c) A description of the vendor's qualifications for providing the NWSTG Backup GSC (including the extent 
	of subcontracting) and past experience in providing and supporting relevant server systems.

(d) Section 508 compliance information on all proposed systems

(e) Product warranty and maintenance support availability

(f) Statement addressing software compatibility issues given that the proposed solutions must support 
	without modification all GSC software applications developed for and currently executing under the AIX 
	(V4.3/V5.1) operating system as well as currently implemented COTS applications to include AFS, IBM 
	EdgeServer, and Sybase.
						


Interested parties may also submit comments or suggestions in addition to or in lieu of a written approach.  Those comments are welcome, but will not be considered an approach for the purpose of advising vendors as to their viability as candidates for the planned competition.  For the comments/suggestion submission, the vendor is encouraged to provide any comments or recommendations it may have on technology, acquisition strategy, contractual mechanism or other issues that would assist the Team in accomplishing the acquisition. 
  
Vendors responding should provide a point-of-contact, including:  representative's name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number.  Written submissions in response to this RFI should not exceed ten (10) pages (including charts and graphs).  Please submit digital copies to the Contracting Officer (William.Voitk@noaa.gov) in either WordPerfect or Word formats. Benchmark results should be summarized in an attachment to the written RFI response, not to exceed four pages.   It is requested for responses to be received by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on Monday, March 22, 2004.  

Responses should be addressed to the Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Acquisition Management Division, 1305 East West Highway, SSMC4, Room 7504, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 Attn: Jenista M. Featherstone.  Further information may be obtained by contacting Jenista M. Featherstone at (301) 713-0828 x184, Fax (301) 713-0809, E-Mail at Jenista.M.Featherstone@noaa.gov.  See Note 26.

<SOLNBR>214B4500MD099

<CONTACT>Patricia Dobbins, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-762-6462, Fax 410-762-6056, Email pdobbins@elcbalt.uscg.mil - Nancy Dean, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-762-6461, Fax 410-762-6056, Email ndean@elcbalt.uscg.mil
<DESC>The USCG ELC anticipates awarding a requirements type contract for the inspection and repair of various Woodward Governors: NSN 2835-01-326-9626 Diesel Engine Part Number A8241-138, NSN 2910-01-215-0459 Diesel Engine Part Number 8573-647, NSN 2990-01-107-6898 Diesel Engine Part Number 8558-657, NSN 2990-01-122-3873 Diesel Engine Part Number 8240-674, Model EG-B2P, NSN 2990-01-148-9821 Diesel Engine Number 8575-262, NSN 2990-01-154-5554 Diesel Engine Part Number A8570-604, NSN 2990-01-255-7497 Diesel Engine Part Number 8570-378, NSN 2835-01-271-7645 Turbine Part Number 8561-070, NSN 2910-01-346-0658  Turbine Part Number 8560-142, NSN 2990-01-266-1107 Diesel Engine Part Number 8240-763 and NSN 3010-01-417-5446 Actuator Part Number J8240-449, NSN 2990-01-386-8191 Diesel Engine Part Number 8241-588, NSN 2910-01-481-4014 Actuator Part Number 8577-356--  The USCG ELC does not possess the manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures or test specification.  The Government intends to solicit only Woodward Governor and/or their authorized repair facilities.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U. S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, as the Woodward engineering drawings, are available from one source only.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the ability to obtain technical data, manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures and test specification along with the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The procurement involves spare parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacture or its actual supplier, and others proposing to manufacture the parts must either: 1) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturer; or 2) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics). The submission of technical data package for review shall not impede the award of this requirements type contract, but will qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered.  It is the Government belief that only Woodward, the manufacture of the parts, or/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities in duplicate within 15 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing data is required.  This is not a RFP.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Responses must be concise and specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capability should be sent to the attention of Patricia Dobbins at the address indicated above.  It is intended to award a Requirements Type Contract with one (1) Base year and Four (4) option years.  Delivery shall be made to U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center, 2401 Hawkins Point Road, Baltimore, MD 21226-5000.  See Numbered Note  22.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.

2.	ISSUANCE DATE: March 10, 2004
3.	CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS:    April 16, 2004 at 3:00 in the afternoon, Manila Time
4.	POSITION TITLE: Economic Governance Advisor
5.	MARKET VALUE: GS-15 ($85,140 - $110,682)
6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: o/a July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2006 with one year option to renew
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Manila, Philippines
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:


A.  BACKGROUND
 
USAID/Philippines' Office of Economic Development and Governance (OEDG) currently manages two complex, interrelated, and important sets of activities:  1) the set of activities leading toward attainment of USAID's Special Objective No. 2 (SO2)- "A More Favorable Investment Climate" throughout the country; and 2) the set of activities leading toward attainment of USAID's Special Objective No. 3 (SpO3)- "Prospects for Peace in Mindanao Strengthened." 
 
Strategic Objective 2  (SO2) targets two main areas: a) strengthening institutions important to the government's efforts to make corruption a high risk, low reward activity; and b) removing barriers to the development of competitive markets.  USAID focuses SO2 assistance in those sectors where corruption can be especially damaging, e.g., tax and customs administration, government procurement, and administration of justice.  USAID also supports the implementation of the Government of the Philippines’ (GOP) pro-competition policy in areas like aviation, inter-island shipping, and information and communications technology.
 
SO2 activities in the future will continue current foci, but may be expanded into additional, but as yet unidentified, areas.  Identification of these additional areas of focus will depend, in part, on which candidate is elected to the Presidency of the Philippines in May 2004 as well as feedback on the Mission’s new strategy which will be submitted for approval in 2004.  
 
SpO3 concentrates on the armed conflict that has been going on between the GOP and Muslim separatist groups in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago for decades.  The basic strategy calls for interventions that address both peace and development, as it is clear that, over the long run, a stable peace is not possible without an expansion of economic opportunities for the people in Muslim Mindanao, and also that sustained and substantial economic growth is not possible without peace.  Current activities include: a program aimed at facilitating integration into the economy of former combatants; significant expansion of infrastructure in the conflict affected areas; expansion of availability of microfinance throughout Mindanao, with special emphasis on the conflict affected areas; an expansion of production and marketing of high value crops throughout the area; etc.  
 
USAID is currently developing a modified "conflict amelioration" strategy that will continue to address the problems underlying the conflict in Muslim Mindanao, but which will also permit the Mission to address some serious conflicts that are occurring outside of Muslim Mindanao, such as a lingering communist insurgency.  The precise identification of the specific set of interventions that may be included in this broader conflict strategy are still being defined, but it is anticipated that the interventions would include some aimed at expanding "livelihood" opportunities (i.e., a means of making a reasonable living) for people in the affected areas; agricultural development activities, local government capability development, and support for civil society.   
 
B.         STATEMENT OF WORK:

The Economic Governance Advisor will be responsible for:  1) devising appropriate strategies and plans for conflict management outside of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); 2) working with the mission’s governance officer in leading the design and implementation of cost-effective programs that produce meaningful results in strengthening governance; 3) facilitating the proper coordination and integration of these activities within the Mission’s portfolio; 4) ensuring that all activities are coordinated with, complementary to, and supportive of similar assistance activities of other USAID and U.S. government agencies; 5) ensuring that the design and implementation of activities are fully coordinated with international organizations and bilateral donors active in this area; and 6) providing policy advice and analyses to senior Mission management on topics related to conflict management and governance.

The Economic Governance Advisor will provide leadership as a member of both the economic governance and conflict SO teams.  The Advisor will be supervised by the Chief of the Office of Economic Development and Governance (OEDG), USAID/Philippines.

6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	One year 
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:		USAID/CENTRAL ASIA, Almaty, Kazakhstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)	Background

The Regional USAID Mission for the Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR), located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, is responsible for the development and management of the USG regional assistance program directed at improving livelihoods through support to economic, democratic, social sector and natural resources reform and development in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

The Program Support Office provides traditional programmatic support to the USAID/CAR Mission.  The office’s principal functions include: (a) management of program budget; (b) monitoring/evaluation of program performance and analyses of program strategic relevance and direction; (c) oversight of program approval process; (d) management of information services; (e) oversight and final preparation of Mission reporting requirements, principally the annual report; (f) preparation and dissemination of public information material; and (g) management of the participant training program and the Eurasia Foundation grant..

The FY04 program budget is approximately $109 million, with a carryover FY03 budget of approximately $25 million.  The USAID/Central Asia Republic Mission is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Dushanbe, Tajikistan and Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.  The technical programs in the Mission focus on energy/water; health; enterprise development; democracy/conflict mitigation and education.

There is strong Washington interest in the program, including close scrutiny by Congress as well as by the State Department.  Funding for the program is authorized through the Freedom Support Act.  The State Department is responsible for implementation of the act, and USAID programming is done in very close coordination with the embassies in each of the countries and the State Department’s coordinator’s office in Washington, D.C., which has oversight responsibility for implementation of the Freedom Support Act.

The Program Support Office is responsible for management and/or oversight of Strategic Objective 4.2 (the cross-cutting SO), which includes one contract (participant training), two cooperative agreements (Arizona-Kazakhstan Partnership and Eurasia Foundation), carryover budgeting for basic education and conflict prevention and funding for program development and support.

B) Major Duties and Responsibilities

The USPSC Program Officer, reporting to the Deputy Mission Director, is responsible for all aspects of programming oversight, including the program budget and strategic planning related to the Mission program.  He/she is a member of the Mission senior staff and has the following major responsibilities:

1. Advises senior Mission management, including the principal country officers in the Central Asian countries, on all matters pertaining to program direction and strategy, providing analytical and conceptualization leadership for all five country programs managed by the Regional Mission for Central Asia. Also, support the development and management of monitoring, information and evaluation systems (including GIS) to track and report and impact of USAID activities in Central Asia.

2. Ensure availability of technical and program resources to accomplish USAID objectives. Direct and coordinate all activities related to the planning, budgeting and strategy development process for the five bilateral assistance programs, including preparation and revision of Congressional Presentations, strategic plans, program impact assessments, evaluations, and other documents, as required.  Creativity in development of appropriate impact reporting is required.

3. Directs and manages Mission wide semi-annual review process and annual reporting.  Serves as primary liaison with the USAID/Washington office of the Europe and Eurasia Bureau for all programmatic matters.

4. Ensures programmatic and budget support services to Mission technical offices, principally in the areas of program/activity approval, ADS (USAID’s Automatic Directive System) and program budget support.

5. Assures reporting and publicity on USAID programs, both within Central Asia, and to wider audience in Washington.  Reporting incorporates activity reporting, budget reporting, impact reports, as well as public information/press reporting. 

6. Represent USAID as required and brief bilateral and multilateral donors, private individuals and others as needs on USG economic assistance programs, policies, objectives and development priorities, thus ensuring coordination and achievement of maximum development impact with USAID resources.

7. Works closely with the U.S. Embassy/Kazakhstan for input into the Embassy’s Mission Performance Plan, annual reporting requirements under the Freedom Support Act and USAID budgetary requirements.

8. Provides direction for the participant training program, PD&S funds and the development of Global Development Alliance activities.  Assures Mission oversight of the USAID/W funded Eurasia Foundation.

9. Program support office staff development to improve capacity to work more effectively with technical and country offices and increased value added functions.

10. Other duties as assigned, including, but not limited to, providing coverage in the event of absence of either the project development officer or the FSN budget specialist, or both, and providing, if required, office coverage of one or more of the country officers (Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan)

C) Supervision and Relationships

The USPSC Program Officer is supervised by the Deputy Mission Director.  The USPSC Program Officer supervises the following program support office staff:
	1 US Resident PSC Information Specialist – GS-11
	1 FSN Program Budget Specialist – FSN-11
	1 FSN Administrative Assistant – FSN-7
Two FSN Project Management Specialists (FSN-12 and FSN-10) are supervised by the USDH Project Development Officer, but the Program Officer, in corroboration with the Project Development Officer, provides overall direction and leadership for their functions.

As a USPSC the Program Officer cannot directly supervise the USDH Project Development Officer, but the Program Officer will be expected to provide technical direction to the Project Development Officer, and input to the Deputy Mission Director for preparation of the Project Development Officer’s annual evaluation.                                      

Direct supervision of the one contractor and two cooperative agreements rests with the FSN-12 Project Management Specialists.  However, the USPSC Program Officer will provide appropriate technical direction and leadership

D) Other  Factors

A high degree of tact, firmness, and creativity is required at all times.  Interpersonal skills are also at a premium, given the large number of people both within and outside the US Mission with which the Program Support Office must engage.  Mission technical offices operate with a high degree of autonomy and program support functions must be adaptive to a value-added approach.

E) Required Qualifications

10 or more years as a USAID program officer is required.  Persons having served in FE-OC positions and demonstrating program management skills are encouraged to apply.  Supervisory management experience is preferred.

<DESC>The government is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) as part of a market survey for an optical and acoustical targeting system.  Currently, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division has an operational and research requirement to replace an antiquated targeting system.  NSWC plans to acquire the targeting systems as a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) acquisition.  This targeting system will consist of:  1) a computerized integrated data collection point comprised of a main stationary and secondary remote capability, and 2) optical and acoustic targeting systems.  The main data collection point should be comprised of a computerized integrated control system serving as a stationary data collection/storage facility capable of supporting up to six target lanes.  An additional laptop system should be available for remote testing capable of supporting two target lanes.  The follo wing programming and operational capabilities are required for both the stationary and laptop data collection points.  Computerized integrated data collection points should be capable of providing simultaneous reports to individual firing stations for data processing and combined test data collection. Computerized integrated data collection points should offer hardwire and radio frequency interface with each target lane.  For radio frequency interface should be capable of transmitting control data up to 1200 meters. Computerized integrated data collection points should be Windows based and enable the operator to define test parameters and individual test configuration measurements.  Test measurements should be capable of metric and English weight and distance conversion, perform multiple timing, correct and calculate functions and illustrate XY coordinates of each shot. Compute rized integrated data collection points should provide open architecture to enable extended and updated capabilities as they become available.  Computerized integrated data collection points should have an Intel Pentium or greater processor, random access memory of greater or equal to 64 MB, hard disk storage of greater or equal to 10 GB, interface bus which is PCI/ISA Bus compatible, a 10-slot backplane, USB, serial & parallel printer Interface, a display screen of 15 or greater, HP color inkjet printer and plotter, and CD ROM Read/Write capability for back-up up data.  The optical and acoustic targeting equipment should be an open horizontal design to ensure there are no obstructions exposed in the target area, minimizing the risk of inadvertent projectile damage during testing.   The targeting equipment should detect subsonic and supersonic projectiles or missiles of 5.56 mm to 155mm.  The optical equipment should have an operational target area in excess of 3m X 3m, accepting 5.56mm to 155mm calibers.  It should provide automatic buffering of data during rapid fire.  The optical and acoustic targeting equipment should be readily man-portable and mounted / secured to ensure precision alignment.  The acoustic targeting system should accept a rate of fire of 900+ rounds per minute and have a 1000 shot memory.  Accuracy should be + 1mm over the central target with + 3 mm otherwise.  The manufacturer or its representative will provide on-site installation and troubleshooting support for any additional hardware or test program software.  The manufacturer or its representative will provide on-site operational training for all equipment and software.  The manufacturer or its representative will provide any scheduled service maintenance, including pr ogram upgrades for a period of 5 years.  The manufacturer or its representative will maintain service and repair of all system parts for a period of 5 years upon completion of installation.  Solicitors must submit performance capabilities and cost estimates in English measurements and US currency.

<DESC>This is a “Request for Information (RFI)” Issued by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Glynco, GA, for the purpose of conducting market research on driver training simulators.  In March 2000, the FLETC issued the original notice seeking information on simulators, but no funds were available to begin the procurement process.  Funding is still not available, but the FLETC Driver and Marine Division (DMD) wishes to obtain the most current information on these simulators for the purpose of identifying simulations and simulators (part task or full task) that can enhance on-range training in-part or whole, and /or augment the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center’s law enforcement driver training.   The information will be viewed with regard to efficacy of positive transfer of training, advanced simulator capabilities, ability to be smoothly integrated into existing programs and any reliable enhancement of the law enforcement driver’s performance over time.  The system should also have the capability of producing/recreating computer generated images all of the FLETC’s driving ranges in their entirety.

Specific information should be provided concerning the potential of Simulator Adaptation Syndrome (SAS) induced within the FLETC typical student demographic by the product.  Please provide detailed information of any countermeasures that are recommended or required to reduce the degree and frequency of SAS.  Also, please provide the time recommended if an introductory weaning-in protocol is necessary prior to training actually beginning.

The DMD will view the manufacturer’s information to determine if an on-site demonstration is desired. There is no guarantee from the FLETC that manufacturers responding to this notice will receive an on-site demonstration request, but if sufficient information showing a simulator meeting the above minimum requirements is not received in response to this notice, the FLETC will assume that there is no interest in such a demonstration from manufacturers who do not respond.  On-site demonstrations must be furnished at no cost to the Government; there is no guarantee on the Government’s part that funds will be made available to the FLETC for a procurement of any simulator.  FUNDS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT AND THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  Send information to DHS, FLETC, 1131 Chapel Crossing Road, Glynco, GA  31524, ATTN:  Cynthia D.

<RESPDATE>031904
<CONTACT>DONA APGAR, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3271
<DESC>The US Army TACOM-Picatinny is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources for supplying the U.S. Army with a Technology for Current 120mm combat rounds to limit mission effectiveness that expose soldiers to unnecessary risk.  Funding for this program could be provided by the (FCT), Foreign Comparative Testing Program.  The technology is to provide Enhanced Lateral Effect against requirements to defeat light & medium vehicles, buildings & bunkers, and double reinforced concrete walls with low collateral damage. This would eliminate safety problems related to the current M830A1.   The Warhead technology could be used to modify existing unserviceable rounds currently in the demil stock pile; which would be either Kinetic Energy (KE) or High Explosive warheads. Existing metal parts can be used to create an alternate inert warhead to meet current mission requirements against light & medium vehicles, buildings & bunkers.    The Government intends to test then procure a round with M830/M908 performance without the associated safety hazards.  The technology should utilize hydrostatic shock to couple non-explosive energy to achieve the desired explosive effects.   Applications should be applied for M908, M830A1, M829, and M455 tank rounds as well as replacement of explosive fills for artillery, mortar ammunition, missile warheads, and low collateral damage bomb fills.  The warhead should not contain explosives or fuzes and should be totally insensitive.  Obsolete ammunition should be retrofitted inexpensively with this technology to make state-of-the-art multi-purpose ammunition that improves the survivability of light vehicles, due to the absence of explosives.  Warheads with this technology should be easily and safely demilitarized. Respondents should have sufficient production capacity to supply the U.S. Army. Interested firms, who feel they are capable, are invited to indicate their interest by providing the U.S. Army a detail description including a ROM, and a brief summary of their company’s capabilities including brief description of facilities, personnel, past production experience and environmental compliance as it relates to the product. A follow-up detailed questionnaire may be provided to survey respondents and on-site visit may be performed as a result of further analysis. Samples from respondents may be purchased for in-house preliminary testing. Interested firms should provide the manufacturer’s name, address, point-of-contact, telephone number, e-mail address, size of business (small/large) and country where the facility is located. The information must be submitted within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication to:U.S. Army TACOM-Picatinny PC3, Picatinny NJ 07821 rpipchick@pica.army.mil.  This Market Survey is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Market Survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The information you provide will only be used by the U.S. Army in developing its acquisition approach for future 120mm combat rounds that expose soldiers to unnecessary risk. Note 25, and 26

<SUBJECT>D -- Pre-solicitation Announcement:  Technology Support & Development Project (TSDP) for the FBI  (previously known as Information Technology Support Procurement [ITSP])
<DESC>Technology Support & Development Project (TSDP) is the name given to the follow-on effort to the Information Technology Support Procurement (ITSP) Contract, which will expire in 2004.    This change of project name was made to more accurately reflect the scope of the follow-on effort.  Once awarded, the TSDP contracts will encompass those continuing tasks that were previously handled under ITSP.  Contractors should not refer to ITSP or ITSP III when responding to this or any future TSDP notices.    
1.  The TSDP contract will require a full range of operational information technology support services.  The full scope of information technology services will be defined in the TSDP solicitation.    
2.  The FBI reserves the right to award up to ten (10) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with provisions for Fixed Price Task Orders utilizing pre-negotiated fixed price hourly labor rates.    
3.  This acquisition will be a total small business set-aside under NAICS code 541511 for which the size standard shall not exceed $21,000,000 in sales annually.  Total small business applies to any and all members of an Offeror’s team.  Large businesses, as primes or subcontractors, are strictly excluded from this acquisition.    
4.  The FBI's Information Resources Division (IRD) will administer the resulting contracts and, to the maximum extent practicable, will issue performance-based statements of work (SOW) with measurable performance outputs.  Several sample SOWs will be included in the full TSDP solicitation.  These SOWs will be for information purposes only and will not be evaluated as a part of the request for proposal (RFP).  However, IRD reserves the right to issue these SOWs for technical and cost proposals after the TSDP contract is awarded.    
5.  Most tasks issued under the TSDP contract will require assigned personnel to have active Top Secret clearance issued by the FBI.  Personnel clearances require at least 5 years of U.S. 
citizenship, absence of a felony record, no history of drug abuse, and a good credit record.  This is necessary for access to FBI mainframe computers and/or to have unescorted access to FBI 
buildings.  The Prime Contractor must also have or be able to quickly obtain, a Top Secret Facility clearance.    
6.  Offerors will be requested to respond with a Letter of Interest via fax identifying whether the Offeror possesses a current facility clearance or has the ability to obtain one; functional areas proposed, and a list of references in which past performance questionnaires were distributed.  The FBI will use this Letter of Interest to make a responsibility determination for each Offeror and create a source list for the RFP distribution.  Those contractors will be invited to submit proposals.  The FBI reserves the right to invite Offerors not possessing a facility clearance, but having the ability to obtain one, to submit proposals.    
7.  In addition to required written proposal sections, oral proposals will be utilized to present an Offeror’s present technical capabilities and business management approach.  These areas will be evaluated in accordance with the factors contained in the full TSDP solicitation.    
8.   The initial term of the contract will be from the date of award through September 30, 2004.  The term of the contract is for a total of sixty months (base period, four one year options and a final option period through month sixty).    
9.   The TSDP solicitation will be released in electronic media only.  It will be available through publication on the Fedbizopps website at a later date.    
10.  Questions or comments dealing with this TSDP announcement must be submitted via the Internet to itcu.finance@fbi.gov by 1/24/2004.

<DESC>CBD COMBINED/SYNOPSIS SOLICITATION

(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source – Hispanic Association of Colleges and University (HACU).  Persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement (see xvi).  

(ii) This Solicitation HQ0095-04-T-0017 is a Request for Quote (RFQ) for Summer Interns. 

(iii) This Solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-20, effective February 23, 2003.

(iv) The applicable North American Industry Classification System code is 813410 and the corresponding size standard is $6.0 million.  The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program does not cover this procurement.

Clin 0001:  Provide six (6) Hispanic Interns for employment at the Department of Defense (DOD) during Summer 2004 (June 7, 2004 through May 30, 2005).  

(v) & (vi) Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities Internship Program General Requirement:  The Secretary of Defense has committed the Department to increase representation of persons of Hispanic background within the overall DoD work force.  A key method of accomplishing this requirement is to better inform current college/university students of employment possibilities with DoD upon graduation through temporary internships of such students in DoD facilities during summer break.  How Requirement Developed:  In the Spring of 1998, the acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy committed the DoD to participate to a much higher degree in programs to enhance the visibility of DoD within the Hispanic community.  The use of the internship program provided by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) was an immediately available vehicle to quickly bring into the DoD workplace a number of highly qualified individuals.  DoD contracted with HACU to obtain the services of interns, who remained as employees of HACU, a more expeditious method than recruitment of persons who would have become temporary Federal employees during the summer period.  Overall Program Objectives:  The primary goal is to continue to increase the visibility of DoD within the Hispanic community, in order to enhance employment opportunities for a wide range of persons.  The expectation is that the interns who work within DoD offices will either themselves apply for permanent positions within DoD upon graduation, or at the very least communicate a favorable impression of DoD as an employer to fellow students, family members, and friends.  Specific Objectives:  Participating interns are provided employment placement to the maximum extent possible into offices closely matching their areas of interest and expertise.  This will serve the two-fold purpose of ensuring that they are able to use their skills in meaningful employment opportunities, and that the offices to which they are assigned achieve maximum benefit of their skills and knowledge in specific functional areas of science, management, financial operations, technology, program planning, or other fields of study.  Supplier Requirements:  HACU will provide the following services:  recruitment of participants; employment (receiving and processing applications, matching assignments); orientation in Washington, DC prior to entry on duty; developmental activities; assisting interns in obtaining academic credit for program participation; support services such as program handbooks and updates, communication; housing assistance; travel expenses to DC area and program evaluation.  Direction on specific methodologies to be used:  Merit principles and careful matching of candidate to employment opportunities.  Applicability of Specification and Standards:  Interns will be fully qualified in specific skills set forth by offices in which employed, and will meet any security requirements.  Period of Performance:  The period of performance for this period is for one fiscal year beginning June 7, 2004 through May 30, 2005.  Government-furnished elements:  OSD and other participating components serviced by WHS will provide office space and requisite office equipment for use by interns during their service.  Government Review and Approval:  A staff member of WHS, Personnel & Security will serve as the internal program manager to provide assistance to management officials and to interns, as required.  Also, will assess the effectiveness of the program at its completion to determine if it should continue in future years.  Reporting Requirements:  WHS, P&S will be continuously monitoring the process to ensure optimum placement opportunities, and overall quality and performance of interns once on board.  Will work closely with HACU to resolve any operational problems, which may arise, plus to assess the program at the end of the summer.  Control Procedures:  The WHS, P&S specialist will work closely with HACU's Program Manager to ensure the highest quality interns, and with OSD managers to ensure that realistic work opportunities are identified to match skills and requirements.  A continuous monitoring will be conducted to quickly and efficiently resolve any program problems.  Inspection and acceptance requirements:

The selection process will result in a group of highly qualified interns to be placed in participating offices.  Interns are subject to review in terms of qualifications and security requirements, and will be in-processed to the extent necessary upon their reporting dates.

(vii) Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance and FOB point: See Item number (ivi) for dates/performance period.

(viii) The following provision applies to this acquisition: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-1 entitled Instructions to Offerors – Commercial.  The following provision is being added as an Addendum: FAR 52.214-31 Facsimile Bids/Quotes.

(ix) The following provision does not apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-2 entitled Evaluation -- Commercial Items.  Award will be based on the best value to the Government, considering price and other non-price factors (ability to meet solicitation requirements and past history).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional 
information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, N00173-04-R-RS05, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2001-19 and DFARS Change Notice 20040113.  The associated NAICS code is 332313 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The Spacecraft Engineering Department of the Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for the supplies and services necessary (a) to replace control systems for three vacuum chambers and their shrouds with new computer-controlled systems, and (b) to properly plumb and wire the three systems. The Government also wishes to acquire an option for installation of a separate thermal conditioning unit for the South chamber, which is described in greater detail below. BACKGROUND: The Design, Test and Processing Branch conduct thermal vacuum testing for satellites and spacecraft components in the Payload Checkout Facility (PCF). The branch operates three large thermal vacuum chambers which can simulate both the vacuum environment of space as well as the thermal cycling that occurs as the satellites orbit the earth.  The largest chamber, referred to as Big Blue, is 16 feet in diameter x 30 feet in length. The chamber is pumped by two CVI TM900 cryopumps. Roughing is by two blowers and a stokes dry pump. This chamber has a shroud that is divided into five zones, each zone having its own circulator. Zone one is shared with the South chamber.  The two smaller chambers are 7 feet in diameter x 8 feet tall. These chambers are referred to as the North and South chambers. The North chamber is pumped by a Liebold Number RPK 60000 cryopump. Roughing is by a Stokes CD 250. The shroud is controlled by a PSI TCU-1000, which has recently been upgraded with a PROCIDIA controller and a Siemens touch screen. The South chamber is pumped by an NBC diffusion pump. Roughing is by either of two pairs of Stokes microvac pumps. The shroud is controlled by the Zone One Circulator, which is shared with Big Blue.   REQUIREMENTS: The objective of this work is to replace the control systems for three vacuum chambers and their shrouds with new computer controlled systems and to properly plumb and wire the three systems. The required systems shall control roughing and hivacuum operation of the chambers as well as regeneration of the cryo-pumps. The required systems shall operate all valves and must display all vacuum performance parameters such as roughing line vacuum, cryo pump vacuum, chamber vacuum, and all other parameters necessary to insure the proper operation of the systems. The required systems shall control the GN2 conditioning for the shrouds in each chamber. Temperature and ramp rate shall be controlled and monitored for the shrouds.  The following requirements are also applicable: A) The control system shall be turn key. B) The control system shall use IBM compatible computers running Microsoft Windows XP professional or the equivalent current operating system from Microsoft. C) Uninterruptible power supplies shall be provided for all controls. D) If power or air pressure is interrupted, valves and other controls shall fail in a safe condition. E) In case of failure of any system the chamber shall shut down safely. F) The controls for the acoustic chamber shall be relocated next to the vaporizer in the pump room. G) All old plumbing, wiring and control panels shall be removed by the contractor. H) Each chamber shall have its own station that displays the status of all systems. The display shall have a graphic representation of the vacuum system and show status of all components including but not limited to: water pressure, water flow, water temperature, nitrogen pressure, nitrogen flow, valve positions, and status of pumps, pressure in chambers and pressure in all sections of roughing lines. I) The control stations shall have a work surface nominally 18 inches deep and the proper height for a keyboard. An electronics rack with a pull out shelf will not be considered satisfactory. J) Each control shall have a backup and turn control over to the backup without interruption should the main control fail. K) The controls shall provide data logging of all parameters. L) The controls for Big Blue shall be wired and programmed so that a third cryo may be installed in the future. M) The shroud controls shall allow the user to enter target temperature and ramp rate. The control shall also allow programming of multiple thermal cycles with temperatures, ramp rates and dwell times. The control shall use multiple type T thermal couples on each shroud. The temperature of the shroud shall be controlled by leading thermocouple or by the average of all the thermocouples. The control shall be able to drop any thermocouple that is out of character with the other thermocouples on that shroud. The operator shall have the option of controlling the five zones in Big Blue individually or as one shroud. N) A blower bypass and valving shall be plumbed into the roughing line for Big Blue. O) The roughing systems for the North chamber and Big Blue shall be connected so either or both pumping systems may be used to pump either chamber. P) All redundant valves and extraneous piping shall be removed from the roughing systems. Q) The roughing system for the North chamber shall be disconnected from the Stokes microvac pumps and all piping removed. R) The shrouds on the South chamber shall be reconnected to zone one of Big Blue. The controls shall isolate the shroud that is not being used. Unless the option for installation of a separate thermal conditioning unit for the south chamber is exercised, proper interlocks shall not allow thermal conditioning to both chambers at once. S) The shrouds on Big Blue and the South chamber shall not be flooded with LN2. T) All solenoids and i/p for Big Blue shall be replaced with current commonly available components. U) The roughing lines for Big Blue and the North chamber shall have valves and vent lines installed to prevent the blowers and pumps from running backwards when shut down. V) The LN2 tank controls and switches shall be moved to the control area. W) The Contractor shall supply five (5) hard copies of AS-INSTALLED drawings as well as a cad file of each drawing. X) The Contractor shall provide five (5) hardcopy operating manuals and one electronic version. Y) The Contractor shall provide vendor manuals for all components. Z) The Contractor shall submit all drawings to the NRL Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) for approval. AA) The Contractor shall submit an acceptance test plan for approval by the NRL COR prior to deliver of the equipment. The test procedure shall be written to insure that all requirements are met by the delivered system. The acceptance test shall be performed by the vendor at the Naval Research Lab with NRL personnel on hand to witness the test and learn operation of the system.  Delivery and acceptance is at NRL, 4555 Overlook Ave., S.W., Washington, DC 20375-5320, FOB Destination.  Delivery shall be no later than 210 days from date of award.   The Contractor’s proposal shall also include the following administrative information, if available: DUNS Number, CAGE Code, and TIN Number. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-2,Evaluation--Commercial Items is incorporated. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>The purposes of Amendment No. 2 to Solicitation No. S-LMAQM-04-R-0045 are to: (1) correct a typo-graphical error to Amendment No. 1 and (2) provide the Questions and Answers to all offerors.  Therefore in Amendment No. 1, under description in the third sentence the word "inadvertly" is deleted and replaced "inadvertently". The following Questions and Answers are hereby provided to all prospective offerors:

1. Question:  Should the cost and technical proposals be
   submitted separately or in one binder:
   Answer:  Separately.
2. Question:  How many copies:
   Answer: Four copies of each.
3. Shall the required “examination operations and support” for
   online examinations be extended to both government personnel,
   and applicants taking the examination?  
   Answer:  The required examination is for applicants.
4. Question:  Shall the proposal include costs to support future
   DS “changes, enhancement(s), or updates?” Or will such 
   requests be covered under separate task orders?
   Answer:  The cost proposal should include costs for the base
   year and the four option years.
5. Question:  Offerors are required to submit 52-212-3 reps. and 
   certs. Can you send me a copy of these so I can complete them.
   Answer:  FAR Part 52-212-3 reps and certs can be attained at
   website http://www.arnet.gov/far.
6. Question:  The RFP indicates that the test results will be 
   delivered according to a schedule.  How often is the test to
   be offered or is it to be offered continuously?
   Answer:  At present, the test is offered twice per year, there
   is a strong possibility that it could be offered continuously
   and it should be designed to do both. (twice per year and
   continuously)  DS will decide that sometime in the future.
7. Question:  The RFP states that deliverables are due X days 
   after contract award.  Are these calendar days or business 
   days?  We are assuming calendar days.
   Answer:  Calendar days.
8. Question:  Will pilot test examinees be incumbents or 
   applicants?  Approximately how many people do you expect will
   be tested during pilot?   Approximately how many people do you
   expect will be tested during each operational administration?
   Answer:  Pilot test examinees will be applicants.  All the
   persons that apply will be tested during the pilot.  DS do not
   know how many people will be tested during each 
   operational administration, it could range from 500 to 2000.
9. What type of cost proposal is expected?  We are assuming fixed
   price.
   Answer:  Fixed Price.
10. Question:  …will this be an ongoing contract?
    Answer:  It is anticipated that this requirement is for a 
    minimum of five years (Base Year and 4 Option Years.)
11. Question:  Will the contract host the application?
    Answer:  The pilot program, the contractor will not host the
    applications.  All applications will come to HR/REE/EVL as 
    always.  The Contractor will keep a database of the 
    applications and the test scores.
12. Question:  Will the Government provide questions for the pre-
    screening?
    Answer:  Yes.
13. Question:  Does the application need to support the multiple 
    sittings – allow a respondent to partially respond, leave, 
    come back and finish application process?
    Answer:  The application does not need to support multiple 
    setting.  It is a one shotlog on; no partial responses leave,
    come back and finish application process.
14. Question:  The pilot phase deliverable requirement indicates
    a “draft” methodology report “30 days” following contract 
    award, and a “final” methodology report 15 days after the 
    review of the draft.  Given that an online demonstration is 
    due at the 30day mark, did the solicitation mean to state the
    demonstration is due 30 days after the final methodology 
    report (or will the report and development occur 
    simultaneously)  
    Answer:  The solicitation meant to state that the “draft” 
    methodology report is due 30 days after the contract is 
    awarded and a “final” methodology report 15 days after the 
    draft.  The final methodology report and the development will
    occur simultaneously.
15. May we obtain a copy of the KSAPs for the Special Agent 
    position?
    Answer:  Yes, KSAPs are listed in the following:

FOREIGN SERVICE SPECIAL AGENT 
QUALIFICATIONS EVALUATION PANEL
(Background information for panel members)

The current qualification evaluation process uses a written “questionnaire” that addresses several qualification areas (specified below).  The questionnaire is followed by an oral qualification review conducted by a Subject Matter Expert (SME).  Both scores are averaged to reach a “QEP score” for the applicant.  HR/REE has reviewed and approved this qualification evaluation process for DS Special Agent applicants.

Although the process has changed somewhat, the factors used to determine an applicant’s competitive profile are virtually the same as those used in the past.  While the following categories were considered when the questions were written, it serves no useful purpose to use them as ‘headings’ on the examination that is given to the applicants.  The process is used to assess an applicant’s knowledge, skills, abilities, and personal characteristics (KSAP’s) in the following areas:
	
&#61623; Organizational and planning skills
&#61623; Ability to interact with others and oral communications skills
&#61623; Educational competitiveness
&#61623; Written communications skills 
&#61623; Leadership and supervision skills
&#61623; Problem solving ability and judgement
&#61623; Volunteer work, internships, extracurricular activities and achievements

It is important that examiners understand that KSAP’s are the basis for the questions and are an inherent part of the entire assessment process.

Questions relating to organizational and planning skills seek to determine an applicant’s work experience, academic achievements, initiative, planning and scheduling ability.  Some of the questions address an applicant’s experience with office operations, serving clients or other organizations, experiences in planning, organizing, budgeting, etc.  Several questions seek specific examples relating to organizing or planning activities or events, experience with a budget, responsibility for equipping or staffing an office.

Questions relating to oral communication skills and ability to interact with others seek to address an applicant’s participation in negotiations and groups (academic, business, government), working with or training or evaluating others, working with the public, explaining policies and procedures, etc.  Several questions seek specific examples of public speaking experiences, formal speech training, and representing a group’s interests.

Questions relating to educational competitiveness seek to determine academic achievements as indicated by grade point average (GPA) as well as higher achievements such as master’s or law degrees.  An applicant’s preparation and interest in the Special Agent position is also addressed.  Specific scores are assigned according to GPA; additional points are awarded for a Master’s degree in criminal justice, a Law degree, or similar degree.  To determine an applicant’s understanding of the position, they are asked to demonstrate knowledge of the job by describing the duties of a DS Special Agent (information concerning those duties is contained within the job announcement).

Questions relating to written communication skills seek to determine the level of an applicant’s past writing experiences.  Specific examples are sought of writing that required analysis and recommendations, of policy documents or standard operation procedures, or instances where the applicant’s writing has been published in a journal or magazine.

Questions relating to leadership and supervision seek to determine the level of an applicant’s experiences in academic, business or social situations.  Applicant’s are asked about participation in informal or formal leadership positions, their work with others, negotiations, and group problem solving.  Several questions seek specific examples of serving on committees where the applicant represented or led a group, experiences in negotiations, training or evaluating others, or informal leadership roles.

Questions relating to problem solving and judgment seek to determine an applicant’s experience in negotiating or solving problems within groups as well as assess an applicant’s situational judgment or reasoning.  Some questions seek specific examples of working within a group or negotiating with other groups to solve a problem.  One question asks what the applicant judges to be the primary purpose of carrying a firearm.  Other questions address what the applicant judges to be the best response to certain situations; two arithmetic reasoning questions are also included.

Questions relating to volunteer work, internships, extracurricular activities and achievements seek to determine an applicant’s involvement in the larger community and participatory experiences which, in turn, provide some indication of abilities to work or socialize with others, show initiative, resourcefulness, or dedication.  Questions seek specific examples of participation in civic, social, professional organizations or associations, work as a paid or unpaid intern as well as certification of the applicant’s skills such as professional licenses, certification of various skills, or awards.

The combination of the written questionnaire, with an oral follow-up to further assess the applicant by asking for specific examples or explanations, are all directed towards evaluating the applicant’s qualifications and competitiveness.  Applicants whose scores are sufficiently competitive may have their candidacy continued through the oral BEX examination. End of Amendment No. 2.
