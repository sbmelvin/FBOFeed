<DESC>Monitoring Worker Exposures to Magnetic Fields and Contact Currents
This is a modification to and existing Purchase Order.  No solicititation will be issued for this requirement. Award will be made to vendor already under contract. 
NIOSH has been measuring worker exposures with two new personal monitors: the Multiwave System III (M3), made by Electric Research and Management, and the contact current meter (CCM), made by Enertech Consultants. In this study, NIOSH is collaborating with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in comparing the MW3 and CCM measurements with exposure estimates from interviews with the same subjects. The vendor shall take full-shift exposure measurements with the MW3 and CCM on workers from 9 occupational categories, following NIOSH's detailed measurement protocol. The vendor will take full-shift measurements on 78 volunteers who also agree to be interviewed.  NIOSH will provide 7 complete sets of instruments (M3, CCM, and EMDEX II meters), their batteries, PCMIA flash memory cards, software for data handling, vests for wearing the instruments, and battery test equipment. The vendor will provide laptop computers with PCMIA slots, an up-to-date Windows operating system, and Microsoft' s ACCESS database program (version 2000 or later), plus equipment for backing up and delivering the electronic data collected on each subject (approximately 50 MB per subject). The vendor shall also obtain the cooperation of company where the measurements can be taken. The company would allow the vendor to recruit volunteers from a range of white collar and blue collar jobs, including some that work with electricity.

Summary of Measurement Tasks:
The measurement protocol (available from the Project Officer) includes the following tasks to be performed by the vendor:
1. Obtain the cooperation of a company (approved by the project officer) to participate in the measurements. Schedule times for measurements at one of the company's sites.
2. Recruit volunteers for measurements from 6 occupational categories from the Standard Occupational Classification Manual (2000). 12 volunteers per occupation will be recruited. The occupations shall include both white and blue collar jobs.  The target occupations will be approved by the Project Officer before full-shift measurements are taken.
4. Before each day of measurements, prepare the instruments, batteries, memory cards cables, electrodes, vests, task logs, and data sheets. Ensure the equipment is working, batteries are charged, and vests are clean.
5. With each volunteer, explain the purpose of the study, and obtain their signature on an informed consent form. Obtain their permission to be interviewed by phone about their work with electricity and electrical equipment (10 minutes duration). Obtain phone numbers and times when they could be interviewed over the next week.
6. Place the CCM electrodes on the subjects' arms and leg, and assist them in running the contact wires underneath their clothes to the contact current data collection unit.
7. Help the subject put on the vest with the MW3, CCM, and EMDEX II in its pockets.
8. Turn on the instruments and record the start times.
9. During the workday, observe the tasks performed by selected subjects, and record the times on data sheets provided by the Project Officer.
10. Before the end of the workday, retrieve the vest with the meters and the task logs. 
Secure the electronic data from all meters and shut them down.
11. After the workday, download the electronic data onto a laptop PC, back it up, and check for data integrity, using software provided by the Project Officer and following the quality control procedures in the protocol.
12. Enter occupations, locations, tasks, and start times into an ACCESS data base provided by the Project Officer.
13. Report progress and problems to the Project Officer each day.
14. At the end of the week, send the Project Officer a CD with all electronic data and copies of all logs and tracking data sheets.
The first 30 measurements in this study will be done by Exponent Health Services of Menlo Park, CA under the direction of Dr. Michael Kelsh (650-688-1764 (phone), 650-699-1799 (fax), mkelsh@exponent.com).  The NIOSH project officer will train the Exponent personnel who will be taking those 30 measurements.  The same people who took the first 30 measurements must take the 78 measurements in this Statement of Work.
Deliverables:
For 78 workers, deliver complete data sets from full-shift monitoring (at least 5 hours) with the MW3, CCM and EMDEX II, plus copies of all data sheets, to the Project Officer. After each day of measurements, provide the names and phone numbers of the volunteers to the interviewer designated by the Project Officer.

Delivery Date: Three months.
No phone calls will be accepted.  Point of contact is Dwight D. Favors dyf3@cdc.gov

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovation Technology Administration, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.    The Volpe Center is currently supporting the Technical Support Working Group (TSWG) and its Credentialing Test and Demonstration Project.  The TSWG Credentialing Test and Demonstration Project seeks to test and demonstrate whether the integration of a biometric with the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) will, (1) enhance vehicle driver authentication without adversely affecting throughput at a U.S. port of entry, and (2) facilitate  defense against nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack.  The proposed period of performance for this project is one year from date of award of the contract.  The project calls for five (5) task areas to be completed by the contractor.  The Volpe Center intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to EG&G Technical Services, INC. Albuquerque, NM (EG&G).  EG&G was determined to be uniquely qualified, due to the company’s prior experience in the design and development of Personal Identification Credential System (PICS).  The demonstration phase will utilize the PICS, which will be installed at various locations at a U.S. port.  EG&G has developed the key technology that will be used in the demonstration project; namely, the PICS.  This system and the biometric devices us ed at the front end of the system are the backbone of the demonstration.  Under the proposed contract, the contractor must integrate the existing PIC devices with a smart card reader and develop a methodology for passing biometric data between the smart card credential to be used (the TWIC) and the PIC biometric device.  Finally, to fulfill the contract, the contractor must perform technical assistance for the duration of the demonstration.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541330 and the small business standard is $4.0 million.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested firms have 15 calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the above named point of contact, clear and convinc ing documentation of their companies` capability to provide required services.  Such documentation will be utilized solely for the purpose determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses received after 15 calendar days or without the required documentation will be considered non-responsive and shall be considered.  The Government shall not pay for any documentation provided in response to this synopsis and documentation received will not be returned to the sender.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses received to this synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202, Advisory Multi-step Process, this Request for Information (RFI) is the predecessor to the actual Request for Proposal (RFP) the government anticipates releasing next month.  We anticipate the award of a Firm-fixed Price (FFP) full service Land Mobile Radio (LMR) IDIQ contract with an expected ordering period of 5 years with 1 year of additional performance.   As part of Market Research, this RFI will be used determine if there is more than one source capable of providing commercial, maintenance services of government owned conventional LMR and Trunked Land Mobile Radio (TLMR) for bases and tenant organizations assigned to the authority of the AETC.  The Air Force is interested in determining if sufficient numbers of capable and qualified small businesses (SB) are available and interested in providing the contemplated services.  The Air Force reserves the right to set-aside a portion of, or this entire acquisition for SB.  In order for the Government to determine if some type of SB set-aside is appropriate, it is requested that SB concerns provide sufficient written information supporting their capability to perform, and comments indicating whether or not they would be likely to submit a proposal if a formal solicitation is forthcoming.  Note:  Small business concerns should also refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 9.6 --Contractor Team Arrangements, and FAR 19.1 -- Size Standards. 

The intent of this advisory multi-step process is to complete a rapid assessment of the qualifications and capabilities of interested sources in order to mitigate program cost, schedule and performance risks by identifying the most “highly competitive” firms who have the greatest potential to be viable competitors.  The North American Industry System Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 811213 with a size standard of $6M.  Once market research is complete, the RFP will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website http://www.eps.gov.  It will be the responsibility of prospective offerors to check this site regularly for any postings or changes.  Prospective offerors must be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Registration (CCR).  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.  All responsible small businesses are encouraged to respond.  

Our desire is to continue into a source selection with only those firms considered most highly competitive.  We will advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  In accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act, any interested firm initially not determined as a viable competitor may participate in the resultant acquisition.  This advisory multi-step process is intended to help prospective offerors make a more informed decision of their probability of success and determine whether or not they should proceed with a full proposal effort.  The information received as a result of this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not be paid for by the government.  


Overview: This acquisition will consist of a firm fixed priced command wide contract to maintain existing Security Forces, Fire and Medical personnel’s Motorola Land Mobile Radios (LMR).  LMRs consist of portables, mobiles, and consolettes, which can be either stand alone (conventional) or part of a network system (trunked).  This requirement will also upgrade LMRs from current Digital Encryption Standard (DES) to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and allow for the purchase of new LMRs.  LMR/Trunked Land Mobile Radios (TLMR) maintenance services in AETC are currently provided on individual contracts at each base.  The Air Force seeks to consolidate LMR/TLMR maintenance services at thirteen (13) AETC bases and tenant organizations in a way that meets or exceeds the required service level through one command-wide LMR/TLMR maintenance services contract.  The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and services necessary to perform the maintenance and repair of government owned conventional LMR and Trunked Land Mobile Radio (TLMR) in the following frequency bands 138-150.8, 162-174, and 406.1-420 Megahertz (MHz).  The equipment, to include TLMR infrastructure (i.e. SmartZone controller, Ambassador Bank, repeaters, telemetry monitoring system), portables, mobiles, consoles, digital interface units (DIU), conventional repeaters, and consolettes, shall be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications, to include original equipment manufactured parts, software, and labor.  

System Requirements: 1) Provide LMR/TLMR maintenance services to 10 bases and 7 conventional bases assigned to the authority of the AETC.  See Table 1 for a complete listing.

An original and two (2) written copies of the proposal are required.   Proposals shall be prepared using "Arial" or "Times New Roman" 11-point font style on 8 1/2 x 11 inch white paper.  Tables and illustrations may use a reduced font style, not less than 8 points.  Foldouts are not allowed.  All material submitted may be single-spaced.  Offerors should ensure t! hat each page provides identification of the submitting Offeror in the header or footer.  Page count for the combined technical/business proposal shall not exceed 15 total pages. Sealed offers for the items to be provided shall be hand-carried or express mailed via UPS or Federal Express to the following location by 2:00PM (EST) August 12, 2005: COMMANDER, Attn: Mrs. Gabrielle Trickett, CTQ, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA, 22134-5010.  NOTE: Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).  Evaluation Factors:   Operational Effectiveness – Describe your ability to currently meet the performance requirements stated in the technical drawings for the GFRK.  Key features to address include Weight and Additional (Value) Features if any.   Supportability - Key Supportability issues to address include Durability and Warranty. Address any specific commercial or extended warranty provisions for the product.  Past Performance - Provide specific examples of favorable recent past performance that illustrates evidence of your ability to produce, deliver, and warrant your product.  Ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number and a description of the items procured.  Relative Order of Importance:   (i) Operational Effectiveness - Most important. (ii) Supportability – Next in importance.  (iii) Past Perfo! rmance - Less important. Price - Evaluated, but not rated.  Award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal presents the best value to the Government.  In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall operational effectiveness, supportability, and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price.  However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals.  Value Added features, if any listed by the offeror will be factored in.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.  FAR Clause! s: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contai! n a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you!  need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.2! 22-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B. Destination. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS: Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form. Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contrac! tor and training will be provided. Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.

<DESC>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institutes’ Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) has a new innovative requirement to develop and implement a centralized model of Internal Review Board (IRB) review for multi-site NCI-sponsored clinical trials. The goal of the Initiative is two-fold: 1) To decrease the duplicative burden of protocol review that currently occurs at hundreds of local IRBs nationwide on NCI- sponsored multicenter trials by providing a single, centralized review that can be utilized by local IRBs participating in these trials, and 2) to maintain, and in some aspects enhance, high standards for the protection of research participants by providing consistent, expert IRB review at the national level. 

Currently, the Initiative involves one central IRB that reviews all adult Cooperative Group Phase 3 treatment trials and more than 170 participating local IRBs who use the CIRB review materials to conduct their own facilitated review. Under the facilitated review mechanism, the local IRB no longer needs to conduct a full Board review in order to approve a protocol; instead, the local IRB chair or subcommittee reviews all the CIRB documents for any local concerns and accepts or rejects the CIRB review. The local facilitated review process can take hours or days instead of weeks. 

The CIRB has been providing reviews for adult Cooperative Group trials since January 2001.  In the summer of 2004, NCI established a pediatric CIRB to review all COG phase 2, 3 and pilot protocols. The pediatric CIRB will begin reviewing protocols by Fall 2004. It will utilize the same infrastructure that has been developed for the adult CIRB.  The CIRB Initiative has the potential to serve the nearly 2,000 sites that conduct Cooperative Group trials.

Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following: 1) Manage and provide administrative/regulatory support for two Central IRBs, one for adult trials and one for pediatric trials; 2) Manage and support current and newly enrolled participating local sites; 3) Conduct the recruitment and integration of new sites into the Initiative; 4) Provide informatics support and system integration; 5) Support NCI’s internal and external communications efforts regarding all aspects of the Initiative; 6) Implement and manage an Initiative-wide Quality Improvement Plan; 7) Provide support for the formal accreditation of both CIRBs in contract year 2 or 3, as determined by NCI; 8) Develop and implement a system for utilizing central review for sites that do not have a local IRB; 9) Establish and support a second Board for adult trials if it is needed to handle the growth in the menu of Phase 2 protocols.

This is a new requirement and the Government anticipates 1 (one) contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of three years with incentive options for three additional years. RFP-N02-CB-57006-48 will issued on or about January 28, 2005.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Research Contracts Branch, NCI (http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/).  The NAICS Code is 541690.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  No Collect Calls accepted.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for the Development of Unsteady Aerodynamic Modeling Updating of High Altitude Long Endurance Aircraft (HALE)Project at Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) has a need for a Contractor to develop a specific technique to update unsteady aerodynamic modeling of HALE class of vehicles. Development is to be performed of a technique to update unsteady aerodynamic models based on correlation with frequency-domain flight test date (typically control surface oscillation sine-sweep data). One of the most important issues in this effort is likely to be definition of the tuning design variables. While a final selection has not been made, there are two leading candidates in this effort. The first is to define the AIC matrix at a few "hardpoint" frequencies in terms of an analytical AIC matrix and a tuning increment. The individual matrix elements of the tuning increment are then used as design variables. The second method is to define the unsteady aerodynamics in terms of a rational function approximation (RFA), and to define increments to the terms in the RFA as design variables. The software will be implemented first as a prototype in MATLAB or SciPy. This will provide a rapid prototyping environment that will make it very easy to test the formulation for bugs, and ensure that the correct implementation will be coded into FORTRAN. Prototype software and analytically defined test case (Matlab or SciPy code, 4 months after contract award). FORTRAN version of software, demonstrated on analytically defined test case and validated against prototype software.  (8 Months after contract award) Software theoretical and user documentation. (9 Months after contract award) NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from M4 Engineering, Inc., 2161 Gundry Avenue, Signal Hill, California 90755. M4 Engineering has proprietary rights over the goods and services being procured. Inlight that it is a novel approach to solving the unsteady arrowelastic model updating problem that offers a significantly higher chance of success than other algorithms. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and 13. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on ____7/29/05_______.

<DESC>The mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of Systems Safety and Mission Assurance (OSSMA), Resource Analysis Office (RAO), located at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, MD, is to provide capability to Center management for independent cost and schedule estimating; financial, technical, and programmatic risk assessment, and mission risk success. To do so, it utilizes the historical and current cost, technical, programmatic, and acquisition data of completed and ongoing missions, adjustskeweedskewed parametrically to predict the likely outcomes of target programs. The mission of the RAO thus includes the development and maintenance of current cost models, supported by programmatic resource and technical databases, as well as on-going market surveys and current cost projections, quotes, bids, and estimates—collectively, the substance of NASA’s “corporate knowledge.”  The CEPAAD program is critical to the efficient operation of the Goddard Space Flight Center, since its product is the basis of accurate and timely resource estimation and forecasting models for the planning and acquisition of future projects and acquisitions. These include spacecraft programs; ancillary scientific instruments; scientific payloads and suites; mission systems integration and test; and other key resource elements (i.e. cost, schedule, workforce, and risk assessment). Because this program is vital to the success of ongoing and future work at the Center, it is critical that the collection and evaluation of acquisition data continue on an uninterrupted basis, and at the same high rate of capture that exists at the present time.  In view of this constraint, the RAO has determined that only Northrop-Grumman Information Technology of McLean, Virginia (the incumbent of some twenty-five years’ standing) possesses sufficient historical, technical, and functional knowledge of both the operational history of the CEPAAD and the vast amount of data that has been collected, analyzed, and archived from the program’s inception to be capable of quick, efficient, and continuous response to the Center’s ongoing demands. The methodologies and approaches used by its support professionals reflect a comprehensive understanding of the evolving needs and objectives of the RAO, and its functional performance has been tailored and refined accordingly.  GSFC therefore intends to make a noncompetitive award to Northrop–Grumman Information Technology for this acquisition. The governing statutory provision is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), “Only One Responsible Source.” Other offerors interested in demonstrating their ability to meet the requirements of the CEPAAD Statement of Work are invited to submit a written statement of their capabilities, qualifications, and management and transition plans to Dr. Carol Barton by e-mail at cbarton@pop200.gsfc.nasa.gov, or by post at 8800 Greenbelt Road, Building 11, M/S 210.3, Greenbelt, MD 20771, not later than 4:30 PM EST on August 4, 2005. Submissions made by any other means will not be considered. Responses will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether this procurement should proceed on a single source basis. After a thorough evaluation of all responses received by the indicated deadline, determination that a full and open competition for this effort will or will not be conducted will be made by the Government, solely at the agency’s discretion. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Calgary, Energy Resources Research Building, 3512 33rd Street N.W. Calgary, AB, Canada to provide research relating to the direct measurement of single line-of-site GPS Signal Delays.  Background: A previous research effort conducted by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory determined that it was not possible to make a reliable slant path signal delay measurement using existing techniques. NOAA’s Forecast Systems Laboratory has proposed an alternate technique to measure a proxy quantity called the differential slant-path signal delay.  The principal investigator will study the feasibility of making such a measurement by carrying out at series of realistic computer simulations of increasing complexity. If the result of these simulations warrant, actual field measurements will be made using GPS observations carried out by University of Calgary and NOAA/FSL. The results will be compared with independent observations and analyzed to verify physical consistency. The University of Calgary has demonstrated an understanding of the technical and scientific issues involved in the required techniques, have the necessary scientific and academic credentials to accomplish this work with a minimum of risk and time, and they possess unique internally-developed simulation software that enables them to model the problem without significant modifications. This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). This synopsis is issued for information purposes. Information submitted in response to the notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government’s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Anticipated award date will be August 9, 2005.

<DESC>USAID/Colombia, Office of Democracy and Governance, anticipates award of a five year contract, with an estimated ceiling amount not to exceed US$25 million, to provide technical Assistance, training, logistics, sub-grant administration, and procurement agent support for justice sector reform and modernization of selected Colombian GOC (Judiciary and Government) and civil society organizations to achieve objectives of a new Justice Reform and Modernization program (JRMP) for the period 2006-2010.

This new effort will include results areas to broaden, deepen and build on justice sector reform achievements to date, while responding to new challenges and opportunities to strengthen the GOC justice system.    

The Judicial Reform Implemented and Access to Justice Broadened program (hereinafter referred to as the Judicial Reform and Modernization Program (JRMP) will support Colombian judiciary initiatives to be more independent, effective and transparent. The program will also broaden access to justice through an array of initiatives offering free and timely access to legal services for millions of economically or socially disenfranchised, violence impacted and/or geographically marginalized Colombians.

While the program’s decided focus is on strengthening the GOC’s capacity to implement the new criminal accusatory system reform, improve court administration in accusatory system jurisdictions and enhance access to justice (especially for the poor and disenfranchised); the  program will also assist the GOC to respond to juridical requirements of peace processes through the following cross-cutting (justice sector, human rights and peace initiatives areas) IR.   

The U.S. Department of Justice in Colombia, primarily through the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance program (ICITAP) and the  Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) will be the lead USG organization providing technical, training and logistics support assistance to GOC Colombian law enforcement organizations (e.g. police, investigative and criminal intelligence agencies, Attorney General and national prosecutor offices, crime scene and forensics organizations).    

The RFP will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fbo.gov) not less than 30 days after this notice is issued. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure services for Mutational Spectrum Analysis of the Von Hippel Lindau Gene in Kidney Tumors from Cases Enrolled in the Eastern European Renal Cell Cancer Study.

This requirement is being prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The acquisition will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial items.  This acquisition is set aside for a Total Small Business.  The North American Industry Classification Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $10M.  

Background: The incidence rates of kidney cancer vary substantially across Central and Eastern Europe, from a low of 9.0 per 100,000 men in Bucharest to a high of 17.0 per 100,000 men in the Czech Republic in the early 1990s. The diverse incidence rates may in part be due to a wide range of environmental exposures, but the specific reasons are unclear.  The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have experienced serious occupational and environmental health problems because of insufficient resources for improvement of old fashioned technologies and replacement of worn out equipment to reduce exposures. The greater chance and more diverse levels of exposures to occupational carcinogens in this part of the world present a unique opportunity to assess occupational risks for cancer. In 2000, investigators at NCI in collaboration with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) launched a case-control study of kidney cancer in six centers in Central and Eastern European countries (I.E., Bucharest, Romania; Brno, Olomouc, and Prague Czech Republic; Lodz, Poland; and Moscow, Russia) to evaluate risks in relation to occupational exposures. 

Contractor Requirement: This procurement shall be for DNA extraction of formlin fixed paraffin embedded and mutational spectrum analysis of exons 1-3 of the VHL gene. 1) Design amplicons for each target fragment for analysis of three exons of the VHL gene, 2) Optimize PCR conditions for PCR amplification of exons 1-3 of the VHL gene, 3) Perform double stranded sequencing and screen PCR amplified samples for sequence variations, etc. 

Period of Performance:

August 15, 2005 – August 14, 2006

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm fixed price award to Charles River Associates International, Inc., 
John Hancock Tower, 200 Clarendon Street, T-22, Boston, Massachusetts  02116-5092. The objective of this simplified acquisition is to make use of Charles River Associates International (CRAI’s). Inc. technical expertise in public finance and computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling.  CRAI staff has been integrally involved in the development of the CMS CGE model of medical care expenditures.  In addition, a CRAI staff member is the developer of the computer software used to code and solve the CMS CGE model (MPSGE—Mathematical Programming System for General Equilibrium analysis).  CRAI will provide consulting services to the CMS Office of the Actuary to provide assistance in several areas: (1) modifications to the CMS CGE medical expenditure model.  (2) simulations using the CMS CGE model.  (3) consistency with Social Security Administration economic projections.  As part of the process to integrate the CMS CGE model with the methods of the Trustees’ Report, CRAI will assist the CMS Office of the Actuary in enhancing our computational framework to provide a closer match with current SSA assumptions over a medium term.  Inputs will include SSA estimates of real GDP, productivity, and interest rate assumptions, and (4) further enhancements to the CGE model.  CRAI is uniquely qualified for several reasons: 
(1) CRAI staff was integrally involved in developing the existing CMS CGE model.  This follow-on project involves upgrading the CMS CGE model to meet the requirements of the Medicare Trustees.  CRAI’s knowledge of the existing CMS CGE model and expertise with the MPSGE programming language make them indispensable to the project.  Even if it were possible to hire someone with CRAI programming skill and knowledge of MPSGE it would take a considerable amount of time to educate the new programmer on the theory and design of the current model. (2) The current model is written in the computer programming language GAMS/MPSGE (General Algebraic Modeling System/Mathematical Programming System for General Equilibrium).  A CRAI staff member is the developer of MPSGE and is continuously involved in updating and improving the system.  He has unequaled knowledge of the capabilities of MPSGE and this knowledge has been instrumental in translating the complex mathematical theory that motivates the CGE model into executable computer code. (3) CRAI has substantial academic and consulting experience.  They have designed and developed models for a variety of applications including:  economic models to study the effects of global climate change, models to analyze the effects trade liberalization, models to analyze the effects of changes in tax policy.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.  In addition, all potential contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration System (CCR) www.ccr.gov.

NIST requires such software to run on NIST's existing software program.  The Government is unaware of any other comparable software or other source from which Knowledge Paks Software can be obtained.

(Subject to FAR 52.217-7); 

This Notice of Intent to Sole Source is not a request for quotation, and no solicitation is available.  However, any interested party may submit a written evidence of their interest and bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement to Myrsonia.Diaz@nist.gov no later than the response date for this posting.  Supporting evidence must be furnished with that statement in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements noted above.  Such information will be reviewed only to determine if it is necessary for the Government to conduct a competitive procurement.  The determination not to compete the requirement is exclusively within the discretion of the Government.  All questions regarding this synopsis shall be directed to Myrsonia.Diaz@nist.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The RDECOM Acquisition Center- Edgewood Area intends to negotiate with Constellation Technology Corporation, 7787 Bryan Dairy Rd, Seminole, FL, for the procurement of a proprietary multiplex, microarray confirmation sensor for biological warfare agen t identification in the Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS). Market research has indicated that no other viable sources for this requirement presently exist. The confirmation sensor shall be able to rapidly identify the presence of a biological  threat with an objective P(id) of 0.98 and P(fid) of less than 0.02 at an 80% confidence, and shall be capable of performing microarray, multiplexed confirmation analysis of at least 10 potential biological threat aerosols.

<DESC>Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs, Cleveland, Ohio, intends to sole source a contract with the University of Chicago, Department of Medicine to furnish a method of evaluating how healthcare is delivered. This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302 - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NAICS 541710 applies to this procurement. The research project is based on a particular uniqueness required by the Medical Center which includes but is not limited to the following: This research project is based upon a particular method of evaluating how healthcare is delivered. Most healthcare is delivered not by a physician alone, but rather by a physician or group of physicians working with other staff members such as nurses. One unique method of analyzing changes in practice is using a concept termed "clinical microsystems." This concept includes not only the doctors and nurses, but also the patients. This concept is particularly applicable for diseases such as diabetes where patient self-management is critical. This concept was designed by a doctor with the University of Chicago and therefore is proprietary in nature. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within ten (10) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs, 10000 Brecksville Road, Brecksville, Ohio 44106 or via fax to (440) 838.6052. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs will proceed with the sole source Clinical Microsystems with the University of Chicago.

<DESC>The VA Network 22 Logistics Office intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Charles River Labs, 251 Ballardvale St., Wilmington MA 01887, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition. Charles River shall provide specified strains and stocks of barrier reared and maintained rats including, but not limited to the following: INBREAD LEWIS RATS VAF Female/Male in Grams, Sprague Dawley Rats Female Male VAF, Retired Breeders Littermates, Lactiating Rat with Litter, Inbred Rats _ Fisher CDF Female/Male VAF. These rats shall be supplied at the specified age, weight or sex, shipping and crates, or surgically altered as required for Gastroenterology Research as requested to meet the needs of the VA Long Beach Healthcare System investigators for ongoing research projects. The Contractor shall be regularly engaged in the breeding, raising, and shipping of the rats. The rats supplied under this contract shall be maintained in the Contractor's facilities. The Contractor shall be accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care or shall be eligible for accreditation. The period of performance will be for one twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for four (4) additional twelve (12) month periods. It is believed that Charles River is the sole source for this requirement because of the following: VA Long Beach Healthcare System investigators have established baseline research data using animals that were consistently obtained from Charles River. Deviations in the procedures used by different vendors to house, breed, feed, water, handle, monitor health, perform timed matings, ship, etc. result in production of animals that may slightly or significantly change response to different types of experimental manipulation. Furthermore, the cost to the Government to re-establish baseline data using rats acquired from a different source would be prohibitive and potentially unsuccessful. Also, if another source were used to acquire animals for these studies, it would be necessary to duplicate some portions or all previously conducted studies, thus necessitating inappropriate utilization of greater numbers of animals. The North American Classified System Code is 112990, size standard $0.75M, will be used for this requirement. All proposals received by 4:00 PM Pacific Daylight Time, July 21, 2005, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquires will only be accepted by facsimile at (562)961-1378. See Numbered Note 22.

<CONTACT>Theresa Barmashi, Contract Negotiator, 781-377-3539; Tracy Sheehan, Contracting Officer, 781-377-3998.
<DESC>This Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) whose purpose is to extend the ordering and performance periods for the Reconnaissance, Intelligence Ground Systems (RIGS) Products and Services (RPS) contracts with Lockheed Martin Corp. (F19628-97-D-0008) and Raytheon Corp. (F19628097-D-0009). The contract's period of performance will be increased one year, from ending 31 December 07 to 31 December 08.  This change will not increase the ceiling price of the two contracts.  The extension is a contract action required to finish the acquisition of upgrades to existing subsystems, Ground Control Processor (GCP) and Deployable Ground Intercept Facility (DGIF), which were developed and fielded by the aforementioned contractors, as parts of the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS). The anticipated upgrade candidate planned for functional integration into the two subsystems is the Advanced Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP).  The ASIP sensor program is a development effort centered on providing a near-term SIGINT capability on-board the Air Force Special and Global Hawk platforms.  Its development period will proceed thru 2008.  The scope of the subject RPS contract is concerned with ground-based ISR solutions, similar to the planned upgrades.  The Government intends to contract with Lockheed Martin and Raytheon as the only holders of RPS contracts under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A) and (B), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". <br><br> Please direct any question regarding this synopsis to Tracy Sheehan, Contracting Officer, (781) 377-3998; Theresa Barmashi, Contract Negotiator, (781) 377-3539; or Captain Bren O'Connor, Program Manager, (781) 377-5562. <br><br> This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). Nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The information you provide will be evaluated to identify qualified potential offerors. ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the respondent.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to ESC. <br><br> See Notes 22 and 26.

Any warranty provision shall commence upon completion of equipment installation by USCG technicians.  Government Furnished Resources: Attachments 1-12.  Contractor shall furnish everything required to perform this contract except for the aforementioned attachments.  Delivery shall be 60 days from contract award.  Early delivery is acceptable.  The USCG intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price type contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Approach (including testing), price and past performance.  Factors are in descending order of importance.  Technical Approach is understanding of and capability to fully meet the requirements of the solicitation.  Offerors meeting the requirements of the solicitation will be requested to submit a 23.1 LCD Monitor test unit, with mount, if applicable (see Attachment 13), Bailment Agreement, which shall be returned in the technical section of your response. The original signed copy of the agreement shall be included with your test unit, if requested.  A laboratory bench test and an operational test will be performed.  Monitors meeting the requirements of the solicitation would be temporarily installed for a period of up to 30 days.  The purpose of the bench testing is to ensure the monitor meets the required specifications outlined in the solicitation.  The purpose of the operational testing will be to ensure the monitor unit interfaces correctly and can operate properly in normal working conditions of an operational unit.  Certain environmental conditions cannot be controlled; however, the Coast Guard conducts its operations in a vast spectrum of weather conditions such as high winds, rough seas, and at times in storm conditions.  Past Performance is based on timeliness of delivery and customer satisfaction within past three (3) years.  Your offer should contain sufficient detail to evaluate your ability to meet the stated requirements.  Please provide three (3) references (names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, if available) for past performance.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by including only the price for the basic requirement; i.e., options will not be included in the evaluation for award purposes. The following provisions are incorporated by reference: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (Reps and Certs must be submitted with offer); 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items.  An addendum to this clause is included in Attachment 14.  52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items.  The following FAR clauses cited in Paragraph (b) of this clause are applicable to this acquisition: 52.203-6, 52.219-8, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-3, and 52.232-18.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further actions by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  Offers are due by 3:00 p.m. on July 27, 2005, to the attention of Linda Mullen via email at lmullen@comdt.uscg.mil.  For information call Linda Mullen at 202/267-1639.

<DESC>The Army plans to privatize its transient lodging at substantially all of its installations throughout the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii.  The Privatization of Army Lodging (PAL) office is responsible for accomplishing this goal.  Afte r lengthy deliberation, the Army has determined that the original strategy to use an LLC management structure (similar to that used under RCI (family housing)) is no longer in the best interest of the PAL program.    Consequently, the PAL office is conducting market research to gather input regarding strategies for implementation of lodging privatization that would maximize contributions to the capital improvement reserve account while still providing an acceptable lod ging product with room rates for official travelers that meet the requirement of an average rate not to exceed 75% of the lodging portion of per diem across the portfolio.  Although the Army will not seek to retain an ownership interest in lodging projects  as a limited member in an LLC, the Army does still intend to engage in a comprehensive Portfolio and Asset Management program.      Previously, the PAL implementation strategy involved combining facilities at several installations into a series of project groups, each of which would have been offered under separate solicitations.  The PAL Office is now also evaluating the benefits of c onsolidating the entire program into a single solicitation.     The PAL office is interested in receiving your feedback regarding strategies for maximizing contributions to the PAL reinvestment account while providing a quality lodging product within the rate limitations noted above, as well as comments regarding the p ossibility of offering the entire program as a single project.   Responses received by the Army will be held in confidence.  Responses may be provided via e-mail or by scheduling a meeting with Mark Piedmonte, Contract Specialist, from the PAL office through the following e-mail address mark.piedmonte@hqda.army.mil.  In  order to continue progress on this initiative, please submit your responses no later than August 20, 2005.    Thank you for your continuing interest.

<DESC>Mass flow meters are the most prevalent method used to accurately measure gas flow rate. However, mass flow meters must be calibrated separately for each gas or gas mixture in order to be useful.  The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed a simple economical new gas flow meter that overcomes these problems.  The gas flow meter can measure the flow rate of mixed gases, pure gases, and gas systems.  The device has been tested to give accurate values for flow rates as low as 5 mL/min.  The device is capable of accurately measuring the flow rate of any gas or gas mixture without the need for calibration for each gas, which is especially useful in situations where the composition of the flowing gas changes over time.  The device can also measure different flow rates – from very low flow rates to very high flow rates.  

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in projects and/or commercializing this technology.  It is anticipated that commercialization will be carried out by licensing this technology to a company.  Additional development and support may be possible through Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with some or all of the funding support being provided by the participant(s).  The INL has a patent pending on the method and device.  The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing and implementing this technology into an operation.  Interested parties should respond on or before September 30, 2005.  For questions regarding the technology, licensing, and working with the INL, please contact Jason Stolworthy:

<DESC>Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs, Cleveland, Ohio, intends to sole source a contract with the University of Chicago, Department of Medicine to furnish a method of evaluating how healthcare is delivered. This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302 - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NAICS 541710 applies to this procurement. The research project is based on a particular uniqueness required by the Medical Center which includes but is not limited to the following: This research project is based upon a particular method of evaluating how healthcare is delivered. Most healthcare is delivered not by a physician alone, but rather by a physician or group of physicians working with other staff members such as nurses. One unique method of analyzing changes in practice is using a concept termed "clinical microsystems." This concept includes not only the doctors and nurses, but also the patients. This concept is particularly applicable for diseases such as diabetes where patient self-management is critical. This concept was designed by a doctor with the University of Chicago and therefore is proprietary in nature. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within ten (10) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs, 10000 Brecksville Road, Brecksville, Ohio 44106 or via fax to (440) 838.6052. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs will proceed with the sole source Clinical Microsystems with the University of Chicago.

<SOLNBR>FA8212-05-R-AAAU
<RESPDATE>042905
<ARCHDATE>09302005
<CONTACT>Lorraine   Vernon, Contract Negotiator, Phone 801-777-0135, Fax 801-777-0389, Email Lorraine.Vernon@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI).  The Air Force plans to replace the existing CADC with a more reliable, longer life Unit that carries a ten-year warranty.  This effort will be using performance-based acquisition specifications.  This procurement will be based on the “best value" to the government, not necessarily lowest procurement cost.  The new CADC will incorporate state-of-the-art technology and be compatible with existing hardware and software interfaces in order to maintain form, fit, function and interface to the aircraft.  The information in this request is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting a market survey of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah.  This is not a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid.

We are seeking contractors who are interested in designing and manufacturing a high reliability CADC using modern technology rather than following traditional build to print requirements.  The F-16 Logistics Operations Division has a requirement for an estimated 1300 units.  This effort will replace the current CADC (NSN 6610-01-308-1859, P/N 4025116-907) and also must be compatible with the Upgraded Central Air Data Computer UCADC (NSN 6610-01-372-8170, P/N 8518930-901).

Interested parties are requested to submit two copies of a summary of the capabilities and facilities they have which will allow them to perform the development and manufacture of the CADC.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and an estimate of the anticipated time between contract award and first article delivery are solicited as an aid in the budgeting process.  Include in the ROM pricing full environmental testing needed for safety of flight certification.  The cost and schedule estimates are for planning purposes only and the contractor will not be bound by these preliminary estimates.  This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that procurement will be accomplished.  The government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Written responses must be submitted by 29 April 2005 to OO-ALC/LGKE, ATTN: Lorraine Vernon 6050 Gum Lane, and Hill AFB, UT 84056-5825.  No telephone or fax requests will be accepted.

•	Manage and support current and newly enrolled participating local sites;
•	Conduct the recruitment and integration of new sites into the Initiative;
•	Provide informatics support and system integration;
•	Support NCI’s internal and external communications efforts regarding all aspects of the Initiative;
•	Implement and manage an Initiative-wide Quality Improvement Plan;
•	Provide support for the formal accreditation of both CIRBs in contract year 2 or 3, as determined by NCI;
•	Develop and implement a system for utilizing central review for sites that do not have a local IRB; and
•	Establish and support a second Board for adult trials if it is needed to handle the growth in the menu of Phase 2 protocols.

As these tasks indicate, the Contractor’s responsibilities are more complex than simply the routine management of two central IRBs.  One unusual feature of this Initiative is that every decision the CIRBs make have an impact on a national trial development and distribution system; consequently, all Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) must be integrated with the relevant administrative procedures of the NCI, the Cooperative Group Operations offices and the Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU).  Also, due to the high profile of this Initiative, sophisticated data management, analysis and presentation reflecting all activities in the above tasks is required.

In addition to the above, all eligible small business concerns must document the ability of their staff to meet frequently/or on short notice (within the workday) face-to-face with CTEP Program Staff.

Basic information about the CIRB Initiative can be obtained from the following website at www.ncicirb.org .  There will be a technical question and answer session on December 14, 2004 in the NCI Research Contracts Branch Conference Room at 6120 Executive Boulevard, Bethesda, MD 20892, Room 6005 of Suite 6001, from 10:00AM until 12:00PM local time, to help you in preparation of your capability statement.  If you plan to attend the question and answer session, please send an e-mail or fax to the person listed under Point of Contact, along with all questions you may have, by December 9, 2004, 3:30PM EST.  Please note, all submitted questions will not be answered until the actual question and answer session on December 14, 2004.

Sources possessing experience and demonstrated capability to accomplish the aforementioned requirements are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform the required services.  Information furnished must not exceed 10 pages and should include an outline of previous or similar projects and other available literature for the NIH to perform a proper evaluation of your capability statement.  Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern’s name and address).

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. This is not a solicitation. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Government doesn't intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on the availability of specialized mountain flying training to its pilots. This training is needed to help ensure safety of flight in regions of high elevation and mountainous terrain by preparing pilots to recognize and learn about unique weather patterns, variations in aircraft performance and the use of specialized emergency procedures. As an initial step in acquiring such training, an RFI is sought from commercial vendors engaged in providing mountain flying training. This information should include a detailed description of their training, estimated costs and references. In addition, all respondents should be able to meet the following minimum requirements: (1) The training facility must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate under US Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 141, (2) The training is a syllabus based mountain flying course approved by the FAA, (3) The training is to be completed in a Cessna R182, TR182, C206, 210 or T210 aircraft operated by the vendor, (4) The training facility is to be based in a ountainous region of the country where the airport elevation is not less than 4000 feet, mean sea level, and (5) The flight instructors have a minimum of 500 hours total flight time, 200 hours of mountain flight instruction given, and also hold an Instrument Instructor rating. Once again, it is not our intent to award a contract, but to obtain price, capabilities, and other market information for planning purposes only. We are not requesting an invitation for bid or a request for proposal, nor is this to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the FBI to form a binding contract. In addition, a formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI. All responses shall be submitted via regular postal mail to:  14800 Conference Center Drive, Suite 202, Chantilly, Virginia, attention: Ms. Rhonda Williams.  NO EMAIL OR FAX COPIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

Statement of Work

Summary:

Background:

The success or failure of Government initiatives rests on the timely and accurate communication of information. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is a vast department with a number of dynamic operating divisions dispersed throughout the county. Almost every form of communications technology is represented within HHS’s five broadcast studios. Technical compatibility and connectivity between Headquarters and the Operating Divisions is essential, and more urgently, HHS Headquarters must be able to speak directly to the public in times of emergency. A few years ago, these deficiencies would have been inconveniences. In today's world, they are strategic weaknesses in the Government’s communications network. We must create a communications system structure that addresses the connectivity between all of HHS and the American people.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to acquire mainframe hardware, required to meet the SSA’s infrastructure capacity needs, from a vendor of IBM Mainframe equipment.  The SSA will pursue acquiring z990 model 2084 Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon (CMOS) processors with sufficient processing capacity to meet the Agency’s requirements.  Additionally, the processors must be capable of operating in 31-bit mode and 64-bit mode, and capable of running OS/390 and z/OS operating systems.  The processor must support z/Architecture, as the Agency’s operating system is z/OS.  The z/OS operating system can only run in 64-bit real support mode on a processor that supports z/Architecture.  The 64-bit real support is essential at SSA to improve operating system and application performance by eliminating page movement between central and expanded storage and increasing the 31-bit real storage size restriction.  Running z/OS in 64-bit mode, which is only possible on a z/Architecture processor, is essential to SSA’s future VSAM, DB2 and WebSphere application growth and performance.  IBM Corporation is the only source known with a product capable of meeting these requirements.   

Any firm that feels they have the capability of providing an equivalent product must respond, in writing, within 15 days of this notice.  Responses must be specific as to the alternate product proposed and must include detailed specifications to support claims of equivalency to the IBM Processors. Vendors may submit pricing data.  This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  The Government will not award a contract based on responses received; however, SSA will use this information to assess capable sources.  SSA will not provide acknowledgement of responses received.  SSA will issue a delivery order against vendors of IBM z990 model 2084 mainframes through a GSA schedule contract if the agency receives no acceptable responses. When responding to this announcement, respondents should refer to IBM2006. Responses should be emailed to Kathleen.Cooney@ssa.gov OR addressed to the Social Security Administration, Office of Acquisition and Grants, Attn: Katie Cooney; 6401 Security Blvd, G-C-7 EHR; Baltimore, MD, 21235. FAXED RESPONSES WILL NOT BE PERMITTED. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Requests for copies of a solicitation in response hereto will not be honored or acknowledged.

<DESC>Sources Sought / Market Survey Notice
   
This announcement constitutes a Request for Information for planning purposes.    This is NOT a Request for Proposal.   NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  The intent of this notice is to assist PEO STRI in conducting market research to identify potential sources to provide COTS Components for the OneSAF Objective System (OOS).  This effort is being considered for considered  as Small Business set aside.

Background:

The OOS has been developed as a composable, scaleable next generation CGF capable of representing friendly forces ranging in size from a few entities (individual combatant) to a battalion of entities (individual combatants, tanks, logistic elements, etc... for a battalion).  It also represents enemy forces and noncombatant entities at a level of detail and functionality in balance with that of the friendly forces.  OOS supports the Training, Exercise, Military Operations (TEMO); Advanced Concepts and Requirements (ACR); and Research, Development and Acquisition (RDA) domains’ requirements for a Semi-Automated Forces generation system.  
 


Description

The OOS Components are collections of capabilities specified as discrete modules for independent software development, reuse, or integration. They can be either software or data. Components come in four types: model, tool, infrastructure, and repository. Model Components are in the battlespace domain representing functionality in the synthetic battlespace, such as weapons models, individual and organizational behavioral models, or environmental models. Tool Components are user interfaces that support the OOS lifecycle applications such as plan view displays, control tools, and data analysis interfaces. Infrastructure Components are within the computer science domain and are required as software elements to form higher components and functioning software products. Repository Components are in the data domain and correspond to data elements that are used in support of models, tools, or infrastructure. Organization of the existing OOS components is depicted in the Product Line Architecture Framework (PLAF). However, COTS components to be included in the OOS are not constrained to this set.  

The Product Line Architecture Framework (PLAF) is a mechanism to organize, categorize, and define the layered software structure to incrementally meet the OneSAF requirements. 
The PLAF identifies functionally relevant software components that can be used as building blocks for higher level functionality. 
Within the Product Line Architecture Specification (PLAS), the PLAF provides a static view of the System Compositions, Products, and Components that comprise the OneSAF Architecture. 
Throughout the OneSAF Lifecycle, system and model composition select and configure the components and products required for general or specific use. 
 
Additional OneSAF information is available at http://www.onesaf.org/


Information Required

Interested parties are invited to submit responses addressing the areas listed below.  Electronic responses to this notice must be emailed to the contract specialist at tim.borowski@peostri.army.mil no later than 4:30 PM EST on 
4 August 2005.  Following a review of the responses received, PEO STRI may elect to schedule one-on-one meetings with some respondents to gain additional information.

1) Brief statement of interest/capabilities

2) Other information at such as catalogs, brochures and/or any other documentation that describes your capability to provide the required distribution effort. 

3) Respondents should identify any government and/or commercial customers to whom the same or similar efforts have been done.  Provide a customer point of contact, including a telephone number, e-mail address or web site, along with project dates and a description of the project.

4) All responses submitted must specify, on the cover page of the response or in the transmittal letter submitted with the response, the business size/status of the organization (i.e., large business, small business, certified 8(a) concern, veteran-owned, hub zone, women-owned, etc.).   Small businesses that possess the required capability are encouraged to submit responses to this notice.

Questions pertaining to this notice may be emailed to the contract specialist at tim.borowski@peostri.army.mil.     

NOTE:   This Request for Information is issued for the purpose of determining market interest, feasibility, and capability of sources and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotes (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice.     All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.     Responses to this notice will not be returned.

This announcement constitutes Request for Information for planning purposes.    This is NOT a Request for Proposal.   NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  The intent of this notice is to assist PEO STRI in conducting market research to identify potential sources to provide Software Distribution for the OneSAF Objective System (OOS).  This effort is being considered for considered  as Small Business set aside.


Background:

OOS was developed as a composable next-generation Computer Generated Forces product line.  Supporting three Army Modeling and Simulation (M&S) domains, and developed to satisfy a diverse set of use cases, no single view of the OneSAF system fully captures its capabilities and breadth.  Being composable, there are a variety of instances of OneSAF, each called a System Composition.  Each OneSAF System Composition satisfies specific users' needs.  As such, System Compositions can consist of one or more of 12 identified OneSAF Products supporting all or part of the complete OneSAF system lifecycle, including simulation event planning, scenario generation, simulation execution, system analysis, or after action review.  A given System Composition is driven by the use case supported by that System Composition.  OneSAF Operational Architectures (OOAs) have been developed to describe the various OneSAF System Compositions needed to satisfy defined OneSAF Use Cases (OUCs) and End State Scenarios (ESSs).  The four OOAs are:
·	Leader and Staff Trainer 
·	Course Of  Action (COA), Doctrine, and Combat Development Tool 
·	Seamless Training Exercise 
·	Materiel Development Tool 
Each OOA provides several static system context views that highlight OneSAF’s role in overall system use.  



Description

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain information from commercial sources in support of the Army’s assessment of existing contractor’s capability to provide the services required for development and coordination of software delivery schedules, installation and configuration of the software at the various fielding sites, on-site training (Train-the-Trainer Basis), and connection of the OneSAF system to real-world battle command systems.

Distribution of the OOS software will be to multiple military users/sites within the continental United States and at overseas locations. Distribution will also be made to foreign military customers as well as commercial users.

<SUBJECT>13 -- Flash Bang Device
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is offering commercial licensing opportunities for the following patent.  Licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the patent in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation.  

US Patent # 6,253,680 entitled “Diversionary Device.”  A diversionary device has a housing having at least one opening and containing a propellant and a quantity of fine powder packed within the housing, with the powder being located between said propellant and the opening. When the propellant is activated, it has sufficient energy to propel the powder through the opening to produce a cloud of powder outside the housing, and insufficient energy to fragment said housing. An igniter is also provided for igniting the cloud of powder to create a diversionary flash and bang, but at a low enough pressure to avoid injuring nearby people.

A cheaper, less dangerous way to stun kidnappers or terrorists holding hostages has been developed by Sandia National Laboratories.   The non-lethal device — about the size of a small soda can — creates a blinding, deafening, yet ultimately harmless explosion when lobbed into a room. Unlike earlier versions that ignite from concentrated materials, the explosive source in this device fans out as an airborne powder before it ignites, making it less dangerous to hostages. The stun grenade is also reusable, making it feasible as a training tool.

<SUBJECT>B -- Intent to Sole Source a Procurement
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source contract to Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, 1800 Harrison Street, 16 Floor, Oakland, CA  94612 to assess the benefits of the Polypill for preventing cardiovascular disease for Type 2 Diabetes. A recently published report of a Polypill to prevent heart attacks and stroke may be an important control measure for cardiovascular risk among persons with diabetes. The Polypill contains a statin, three blood pressure lowering drugs each at half standard dose, folic acid, and aspirin, and is estimated to reduce heart attack by 88% and stroke by 80%. The report suggests that the Polypill should be given to all persons aged 55 or over, with type 2 diabetes, or with a history of heart disease because their cardiovascular risk is higher than the general population.  This research will use a mathematical and statistical simulation model based on biologic evidence and validated against clinical trials to simulate the public health implications of the Polypill. The research is part of an effort to evaluate innovative patient treatments, guidelines for quality of care, and other clinical management tools.  The estimated risk reductions for the Polypill are based on meta-analysis, not on clinical trials. New biologic simulation models, such as the Archimedes model developed by Kaiser Permanente, provide simulated results that extend the results of a randomized clinical trial to a slightly different population than that considered by the trial. A biologic model can give detailed estimates of the interactions and relative risks of integrated but separate diseases, such as diabetes and coronary heart disease. A biologic model can be linked to patient treatment protocols to evaluate quality of care guidelines. This project will use Archimedes, an existing model, to answer a series of public health questions that are important to the understanding of diabetes and its clinical management. It is the belief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the Archimedes model is the only existing product that can perform our requirement.  Though other bioligic models exists they they do not include diabetes and heart disease as Archimedes does.  This notice is not a request for offers. All proposals received by 3:00 P.M. Eastern StandardPacific Daylight Time, August 2, 2005 will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The anticipated date of award is August 2, 2005.

<SUBJECT>58 -- LPM Industry Day Conference
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  This notice is for planning and information purposes.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed or obligated to pay for any information submitted in response to this notice, and no basis for claim shall arise as a result of this notice or contractor response to this notice.  Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, Rhode Island wishes to consult with and discuss an Engineering Development Model (EDM) procurement of an imaging and electronic warfare sensor system for the Virginia Class submarine.  This sensor subsystem is named the Low Profile Mast (LPM).  LPM will be used on the Virginia Class submarine and will be located in the Mission Configurable Mast (MCM) bay within a standard Universal Modular Mast (UMM). The LPM development effort aims to develop a non-hull penetrating periscope system with similar or improved features, performance, and functions of the Type 18 periscope to provide a mast stealthier than the Photonics Mast for littoral operations.   Performance levels achieved by the current Type 18 periscope system set the normal capabilities for electronic imaging and electronic warfare functions.  Image processing and electronic warfare processing functions will be implemented in inboard processing and conditioning units (IPCU) to achieve interoperability with Virginia Class tactical systems.  Control and display functions are to be handled via virtual workstation software.   Because of the complexity associated with this development, the government has conducted a series of technical risk mitigation activities on the optical bench design, electronic imager, Radio Frequency (RF) antenna arrangement, RF interconnect and signal distribution, microwave photonic links, rotary seal mechanism, underwater electrical and fiber-optic hybrid cables, connectors and rotary joints, and control/display integration with Virginia Class inboard tactical imaging and electronic warfare systems.  Knowledge gained from the government's risk mitigation effort will be made available to potential offerors for information purposes only.    The desired functional characteristics of the LPM subsystem are as follows:
1. System Architecture
The LPM System Architecture will be an open hardware and software architecture.  Incremental upgrades will be facilitated by modular mechanical, electrical, and RF interfaces.
2. Physical Characteristics
LPM sensor module will be a pressure proofed, non-penetrating mast with a maximum outer diameter of 7.5 inches. The sensor module will be housed within a UMM in the MCM bay position.  The maximum height will be constrained by the existing UMM, and the height of the optical line of sight will be approximately 16.7 inches below the top of the sensor module.  Electronic warfare capability will be provided by antennas, which will be part of the sensor module, with signal distribution components housed inside the mast module.  The estimated length of the sensor module, which includes the Electronic Warfare Support (ES) antennas, optical bench, cameras, cooling, and electronics, should be about eight feet. An external rotational mechanism is required to train the sensor module to provide 360-degree azimuthal coverage clockwise and counter-clockwise with no restrictions. Radar Cross Section reduction will be provided by a radar camouflage unit similar to the one used for the Type 18 periscope. Advanced paint and/or cover material should be considered to further reduce radar, visual, and infrared signatures.  Active cooling and/or heat removal may be required to improve reliability and reduce infrared signature.  The LPM Subsystem will be capable of being operated totally stand alone or interfaced with existing Virginia Class submarine Imaging, Electronic Warfare Support (ES), Combat Control System (CC), and Exterior Communication Systems (ECS).  
3. Electro-optical Sensing
Optical sensing will be provided by an optical bench and a number of imaging sensors covering the visible light (0.45 to 0.65 micron), near infrared (0.65 to 0.90 micron), and short wave infrared (0.90 to 1.80 micron) optical spectra to provide video images at least 30 frames per second.  The desired optical fields of view are 32, 12, 4, and 2 degrees horizontal, all with a 4 (H) to 3 (V) aspect ratio.  The optical line of sight must be stabilized to 25 micro radians or better.  Elevation coverage with respect to the optical axis is 10 degrees (down) to 60 degrees (up).   
4. RF Sensing
LPM antennas will be in a cylindrical volume within the sensor module to house RF sensors and associated components.  RF sensors will facilitate two functions: ES and support functions.  The required ES functions are omni-directional intercept, radar threat early warning for pulse radar, and automatic direction finding for radar signals.  The required RF support functions are GPS navigation (bands L1, L2, and L5), Iridium communication (transmit and receive), and built-in-test function with in board signal injection.  GPS and Iridium may share the same antenna.  In order to accommodate future capabilities, the antenna design must include a six-inch high cylindrical growth space with signal path and power line provision. 
5. High Speed High Data Rate Data Transport
Fiber optic data transport for a portion of the RF spectrum and digital video streams may be necessary for this application.  Linkage between the non-penetrating LPM outboard equipment and inboard processing electronics will be provided by various cables, fiber optic rotary joint, slip rings, and electrical hull fittings that support both fiber optic and copper based conduits.
6. Conditioning, Processing, and Distribution of Sensor Outputs
Inboard electronics will be necessary to demodulate, process, and distribute RF signals to receivers and processing equipment to maintain the same signal and data interfaces to existing tactical ES system.  LPM subsystem's RF processing will include radar direction finding and radar early warning.  Other inboard processing will include digital image acquisition, real time image processing, display processing, high fidelity storage, and random access retrieval.  Digital video signal will be routed to existing tactical workstations via industry standard real time network protocols.
7. Control and Display
A virtual workstation capability will be required to allow the LPM system operation from multiple workstations.  Remote operation of the LPM will include sensor line of sight control, field of view change, camera selection, camera adjustment, system operation, performance monitoring and fault isolation. Control and display will also provide network connectivity to obtain ownship’s information and exchange contact information and imagery with Tactical Control and other shipboard subsystems including off-board image transmission.  A competitive RFP for the entire EDM LPM sub-system is planned for issue during first quarter of FY06.  The program's inventory objective through FY11 is eight (8) systems inclusive of the EDM.  Industry teaming is strongly encouraged to meet the technical requirements of the LPM subsystem.  This Industry Day is scheduled for Thursday, 11 August 2005.  The government will provide additional time for individual discussions in the afternoon.  Total attendance is limited to 75 and each company may send up to three persons to this industry day.

<SUBJECT>A--TEAMING OPPORTUNITY FOR AEROCAPTURE FLIGHT VALIDATION FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM PROGRAM'S SPACE TECHNOLOGY-9 (ST9)
<DESC>NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is performing a technical assessment of high technology readiness level (TRL) aeroshell and thermal protection system (TPS) capabilities to form the basis of a proposal for the NASA Science Mission Directorate’s New Millennium ST9 opportunity. This proposal will be focused on validating an aerocapture maneuver in Earth’s atmosphere in 2010. The purpose of this announcement is to enable MSFC to obtain a teaming partner to participate in the development of the Phase A technical concept and proposal in response to the upcoming kickoff of the ST9 Phase A/Concept Definition studies. Aerocapture is one of five technology concepts competing for the ST9 flight opportunity.  Specifically, MSFC is seeking a partner to design and fabricate the flight aeroshell structure and TPS for an Earth Aerocapture vehicle. A flight validation is viewed as critical to maturing the Aerocapture maneuver for science mission use, since the combined flight environment and execution of the hypersonic maneuver cannot be simulated on the ground.  Aerocapture will benefit spacecraft sent to orbit other planets, by allowing atmospheric drag to slow the spacecraft to low orbital velocities, saving significant amounts of propellant mass. The New Millennium Program is chartered to advance technologies from at least TRL 3 to TRL6, and to provide the space technology validation necessary for science mission infusion.  (TRL definitions may be found on the NMP website, at       http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/JOIN/docs.html	)  The NMP provides value to other programs by providing enabling or significantly enhancing capabilities that these programs could not afford to develop within their own funding allocations.  The NMP is strongly focused on the validation of ground-based models to predict the performance of the system in other environments following the flight, not simply a “pass/fail” demonstration. The Aerocapture technology concept team is led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with participation from 4 NASA centers.  Component and subsystem technologies will be provided by partners selected through the NMP ST9 NASA Research Announcement (NRA NNH04ZSS002N, available for reference at	 http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/closed.cfm	).      The ST9 Phase A/Concept Definition kickoff is expected to occur in approximately August 2005, with proposals due approximately 1 year later.  One technology concept will be selected for Phase B/Formulation Refinement, to begin in October 2006.	A launch date in early 2010 is planned.	 MSFC is seeking a partner to provide a blunt-body (60-degree sphere cone) flight aeroshell and TPS, including backshell, 1.1 meters in diameter, that can withstand heat rates and loads commensurate with a 10 km/s entry into Earth’s atmosphere. The vehicle’s total mass will be approximately 185 kg.  The aeroshell/TPS system must provide vehicle protection, and maintain the outer aerodynamic shape to enable hypersonic maneuvering through a flight corridor, to achieve a target apogee, for perigee raise and data downlink after atmospheric exit.  Currently the aeroshell is not to be jettisoned following the aerocapture maneuver, but concepts should remain flexible if later designs require separation. The aeroshell and TPS must accommodate, at minimum risk, up to six (6) TPS coupons of 8-15 cm diameter, as solicited in the NMP NRA NNH04ZSS002N.	These coupons may be located in the forebody or afterbody of the vehicle.  The heatshield system must also accommodate aerothermal and TPS performance instrumentation for post-flight model validation, provided by partners selected through the NMP NRA NNH04ZSS002N.  Proposed concepts must meet the NMP requirement of being at TRL 5 by the Confirmation Assessment, which occurs approximately one year from the start of Phase B/Formulation Refinement.  Upon submission of this response, the responder’s concept must meet all conditions of at least TRL 4, as specified in the NMP Technology Readiness Level Definitions document, dated May 22, 2003 (available at the above referenced website).  Funds will not be available for advancing technology during the Phase A/Concept Definition phase.   Responses are solicited from all U.S. industries, academia, non-profit organizations, national laboratories, other government agencies, and Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers.  If selected through this synopsis, the partner is expected to become a full member of the technical assessment, proposal development, and mission implementation team.  MSFC and JPL will require the selected partner to provide a letter of commitment.	MSFC anticipates issuing a Phase B contract to the aeroshell provider, provided the Aerocapture technology concept is selected for implementation by the New Millennium Program’s independent assessment process.  Interested organizations shall provide a short response (not to exceed 15 pages, 12-point font, 1-inch margins), addressing the criteria listed below.  The final page of the response must be a cost summary, by year, of the total estimated cost of the system concept, through launch.  Responses shall be submitted electronically in Microsoft Word or RTF format, via e-mail, by 5:00 PM (Central), August 9, 2005, to: Bryan Williford at: Hervie.B.Williford@nasa.gov. Technical questions should be directed to: Michelle Munk at Michelle.M.Munk@nasa.gov. Procurement questions should be directed to: Bryan Williford at: Hervie.B.Williford@nasa.gov. Responses will be evaluated and a partner selected based on the listed criteria. Suggested page allocations are noted in parentheses, within each criterion description. The criteria are defined as follows: (1) Technology Readiness Level and demonstrated suitability of the proposed technical approach:  This criterion evaluates the responder’s prior developments and current modeling maturity of the system proposed, including the amount of relevant component testing and characterization completed (specifying the number and size of samples, test conditions and facilities, and instrumentation methods used), manufacturability demonstrations completed, and the existence of a high-fidelity material response model.  Concepts must have a TRL of at least 4 at the time of response.  This criterion also evaluates the ability of the proposed technical approach to meet all of the system requirements, and remain flexible to changes during the early design phase.  Responses shall include the development and integration approach for the flight aeroshell, and shall include a risk assessment of the proposed approach.  (Suggest 8 pages)	(2) Relevant Experience and Past Performance: This criterion evaluates the responder’s relevant technical experience and past performance in similar development activities including manufacturing, and control of cost and schedule. Provide a description of no more than three relevant technical experiences including a summary of significant achievements and technical, cost, and schedule performance. Responders shall specifically discuss the relevance of their experience in reference to the design and development of space composite structures and thermal protection systems.  (Suggest 3 pages)	(3) Technical Capability, Key Personnel and Facilities: This criterion evaluates the responder’s technical capability to perform the development proposed, the availability and adequacy of key personnel, and the availability and adequacy of facilities. The responder shall describe the technical capability, facilities and no more than three key personnel available to support the proposal and mission development.  (Suggest 3 pages.)  (4) Estimated Total Cost of the proposed concept, by year, through launch:  This criterion evaluates the affordability of the concept, and the credibility of the estimated cost as it relates to the technical approach.	Estimates shall include costs in the categories of Structure, Thermal Protection System, Subsystem and Subsystem Test (including facilities usage), Subsystem and System Integration, and Other Costs (including travel, systems engineering, and other management functions.)  Responders must clearly identify costing assumptions and areas of highest cost uncertainty.  (One page) Responses will be evaluated by a panel of independent experts.	If considered necessary to clarify an element(s) of the response, responders may be asked to make an oral presentation to the evaluation panel.  Final partner selection will be made within 60 days of receipt of responses by the Manager, In-Space Propulsion Technology Projects Office. NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in response to this synopsis.  This synopsis teaming opportunity does not represent a guarantee for selection or award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited.  It is anticipated that partner selection would result in a Phase A contract under which the partner will participate actively in the ST9 Phase A Concept Definition proposal process.	Under the Phase A contract, it is expected that the partner selected would provide conceptual designs, technical data, proposal inputs, schedule and cost estimates consistent with the NASA NMP guidelines as described in forthcoming NMP proposal preparation instructions.  It is further anticipated that selection of the proposal for the ST9 mission implementation would result in a Phase B contract for the selected partner.

<SUBJECT>B -- UTILIZATION OF MID-URETHRAL SLINGS, RETROPUBIC AND TRANSOBDURATOR SLING PLACEMENT DEVICES IN A NIH SPONSORED MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL IN WOMEN WITH STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE
<DESC>NOTICE OF OPPORTUNITY FOR CLINICAL TRIAL COLLABORATION

UTILIZATION OF MID-URETHRAL SLINGS, RETROPUBIC AND TRANSOBDURATOR SLING PLACEMENT DEVICES IN A NIH SPONSORED MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL IN WOMEN WITH STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE.


The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaboration with industry to provide mid-urethral slings and retropubic transobdurator sling placement devices in a NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trial in women with stress urinary incontinence. 

INTRODUCTION:  	The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK) is planning to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate and compare approaches (retropubic and transobturator) for surgical treatments of stress urinary incontinence in women. The trial will be conducted by investigators participating in the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN). The two-arm trial will enroll approximately 500 women and have equal randomization to two surgical approaches, either a retropubic mid-urethral sling placement approach or a transobturator mid-urethral sling placement approach. Enrollment is expected to be completed over 2 years with follow up of a minimum of 24 months and as long as 48 months. Enrollment will occur at nine participating clinical centers (William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan; Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois; University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama; University of California at San Diego; University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland; University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, University of Texas at Dallas; University of Texas at San Antonio, and the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah). It is possible 1-3 additional centers will be added.  Central data collection and analysis will occur at the NIDDK funded Data Coordinating Center at the New England Research Institutes, Watertown, Massachusetts.

STUDY GOALS:  The primary aim of this randomized clinical trial is to compare objective cure rates for stress incontinence as well as complication rates at 1 and 2 years between these two surgical approaches. Another primary goal is to compare bother scores from stress urinary incontinence between these two surgical approaches at 1 and 2 years. 

Other study aims include: 
-	Comparison of the morbidity between the two approaches which will include intraoperative injury, voiding dysfunction, changes of anatomic urethral support, sling erosion, and other complications.
-	Comparison of patient satisfaction and quality of life variables between the two different approaches. 
-	Comparison of the subjective cure rates of stress incontinence and overall incontinence between the two approaches.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  In 2000, the NIDDK established the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN).  The purpose of the UITN is to conduct high quality randomized controlled clinical trials of urinary incontinence.  Currently, the UITN is completing a trial comparing two surgical procedures for women with stress urinary incontinence, “A Randomized Clinical Trial of the Burch Modified Tanagho and Autologous Fascia Sling Procedures.”  The second protocol, developed by the UITN investigators is:  “Retropubic Mid-urethral Sling (RMUS) vs. Transobturator Mid-Urethral Sling (TOMUS)”.  Although this protocol has been recently approved by an independent NIDDK-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board and patient recruitment is anticipated to begin in late winter to spring 2006, the collaborator(s) will, nonetheless, have the opportunity to comment on the study protocol. The Collaborator(s) will also participate as an ex-officio member of the Steering Committee.  It is anticipated that the duration of this trial will be at least 4 years, a 2 year recruitment followed by a minimum of 24 months follow-up. The collaborator(s) will need to provide products (slings) and devices for placement (disposable per patient use kits or non-disposable, sterilizable instruments) at the time of the surgical procedures. It is anticipated that the need of the products will be during the surgical phase of this study, during the initial 24 month recruitment phase and surgical placement of sling of this trial. The Collaborator (s) is (are) expected to provide the products (mid-urethral slings) and/or the placement device product line (either disposable per use kits or non-disposable, sterilizable instruments) for free without charge. The Collaborators may provide either or both sling products and/or placement device products or instruments. The Collaborator(s) may have access to information about the outcome of the study at the same time as the participating investigators.  If desired, the Collaborator(s) may participate as a member of the publication committee.  A Clinical Trials Agreement between the NIDDK and the Collaborator(s) will need to be executed prior to shipment of the products or placement kits or surgical instruments. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” to help in their deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  The Capability Statement may not exceed 10 pages and should address the following criteria: time line for ability to ship sling product or retropubic or transobturator device kits or instruments after selection of Collaborator is determined and prior studies and approval of safety and use of their product. 

TERMS:	The Collaborator will be expected to execute a Clinical Trial Agreement, an example of which can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/CTA-device-extramural.doc.  No funding from the government is available.

SUBMISSION DATES:  A written statement of interest must be submitted by 22 August 2005 and all Collaborator Capability Statements must be submitted by 6 September 2005.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) 2nd Industry Day - Rescheduled
<DESC>This Special Notice is to inform Industry that the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, MD is re-scheduling its 2nd Industry Day for the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) Program.  The JPALS Capability Development Document (CDD) requirements have stabilized and the CDD has entered into O-6 staffing.  As such, NAVAIR desires to continue its exchanges with Industry and its planning of the JPALS Acquisition Strategy for System Development and Demonstration (SDD).  JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)-based precision approach and landing system (on land and at sea) that enables military aircraft to safely execute approaches to landing when atmospheric ceiling and visibility are limiting factors.  JPALS is a Joint Program with the Navy, Air Force and Army as its participants.  Enabling technologies include Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) with an anti-jam capability, a Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) UHF Data Link, and Inertial Navigation System (Sea Based only).  The JPALS program requirements also include civil interoperability for all airborne platforms and land based installations. 

A competitive, performance-based specification RFP for the JPALS SDD effort is currently planned for release in the second quarter of FY06  (Draft available to industry in December 2005), resulting in a Best Value source selection award early in the fourth quarter of FY06. 

The JPALS Program initiated information exchanges with Industry in April 2004 with an RFI release that solicited feedback on contract type and incentives for the SDD effort, anticipated technical or management risk areas, views on the Industrial base for JPALS-related technology, approaches to maximize hardware and software commonality (including test processes and user interface), Modular Open Systems and Software Communications Architecture approaches, and sparing, support, and obsolescence strategies.  As a result, meaningful feedback was provided from multiple Industry sources.  This information proved relevant and is beneficial as JPALS acquisition strategies and technical approaches continue to mature.

Further, the JPALS Program executed its initial Industry Day on 21 July 2004 in Lexington Park, MD.  This included a full day of JPALS technical and programmatic presentations along with a question and answer period.  Attendance was 107, which included representatives from 31 companies expressing interested in JPALS.  Additionally, the week of 13 September 2004 was dedicated to one-on-one meetings with interested Industry partners.  Nine companies took advantage of this opportunity to discuss ideas and lessons learned with the JPALS Government team.

Interested Industry partners and potential prime and sub-contractors are invited to attend NAVAIR JPALS 2nd Industry Day.  Event details are planned as follows:

When:   Thursday, 8 September 2005; 0900 - 1600
Where:  Holiday Inn in Solomons Island, MD.

Pre-registration is required.  For reservations call or e-mail Ms. Ann Alioto, telephone (301) 995-8076, e-mail at Ann.Alioto@navy.mil with the names of all attendees NLT Monday, 22 August 2005. 

Industry Day check-in is between 0800 and 0900 at the conference facility.  The session will break for lunch between 1200 and 1330.  Lunch is available throughout the surrounding Solomon's Island area.

Draft agenda for Industry Day II includes:

1. JPALS Program Overview and Update;
2. Update of JPALS ICD and CDD Requirements Documents;
3. JPALS Technology Development Phase Update;
4. SDD Request for Proposal and Contract Overview;
5. Logistics Update.

Interested parties should periodically check the PMA-213 web site, https://pma213.navair.navy.mil/jpals_industry, for updated information on JPALS.  Industry members are encouraged to suggest additional agenda topics.

This will be a paperless Industry day, but a CD with all briefings will be provided for all participants.

Following this 2nd Industry Day, the Joint Government team will be available for one-on-one meetings with interested Industry partners.   The one-on-one meetings are planned for 3 - 7 October 05 in the Lexington Park, Maryland area.  Interested parties may  contact Ms. Alioto to obtain a reservation for a two-hour (maximum) meeting. 

Other comments and suggestions regarding the Government's course of action and/or alternatives are encouraged and appreciated.  It is requested all written responses and comments be received no later than 4:00 PM on Friday, 19 August 2005.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are a small business (S), a small disadvantaged business (SDB), an 8(a) firm, or a large business (L).

Statement of Work for " GEOSPECIFIC TERRAIN MODELING FOR GAME ENGINES " dated: 20 July 2005 BACKGROUND.  The USMC is seeking contractor support to conduct a one time analysis of Global Mapper software and its ability to provide geo-specific 3D terrain models for use in Virtual Battle Simulations (VBS) 1, utilizing NGA source data (elevation, culture data, and imagery). VBS-1 is currently utilized for stand-alone and local network training of individuals and small units but is restricted to geo-typical and proprietary terrain models. The Technology Division for the Marine Corps Training and Education Command is considering ways in which to provide geo-specific terrain models for all virtual simulations. Therefore an analysis which identifies proprietary issues for current game engines (VBS-1 for the purpose of this analysis) and the issues with interfacing geo-specific terrain models produced from COTS/GOTS tools (Global Mapper for the purposes of this analysis) is desired.  All offers must be received by the Contracting Officer listed in this solicitation not later than 1200 PM on 30 July. Proposals must be submitted with one printed copy and one electronic copy. 1.	OBJECTIVE. The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide USMC Training and Education Command with an analysis of 3D terrain produced by Global Mapper tools to be utilized in VBS-1.   2.	SCOPE OF WORK and TASKS. Provide a written analysis in MS Word format identifying the input data VBS-1 needs/can accept and the data NGA can provide.  The report will also examine the capability of the GM application to convert NGA data into the formats usable by VBS-1.  This will include investigating other COTS/GOTS applications, such as Terrex Terra Vista Pro, and ESRI products, that can do the necessary data format conversions.  The vendor must evaluate the applications to determine if they are suitable for use by an operator with no formal training other than training offered with the mapping tools. For instance, an individual who has learned certain mapping basics such the meaning of raster, vector, datum, and projection and can perform simple tasks with mapping software.  The report must address the following: a.	Review and analyze the VBS1 application and documentation to determine its mapping data requirements and limitations. b.	Review and analyze NGA source data. c.	Summarize, document and submit to TECOM the information learned about the VBS1 application and NGA data. d.	Review and analyze the GM application and documentation to determine GM's capability to process NGA data and output data in the formats required by VBS-1.   e.	If GM was found acceptable in the previous step, test it using NGA data and VBS-1 to determine if (1) it performs as advertised and (2) its ease of use is suitable for its intended TECOM role and users. f.	Review information on other suitable software with an emphasis on applications the government has developed or already has the right to use to determine if those applications can perform the desired conversions.    g.	Review information on other mapping software with an emphasis on applications the government already has the right to use to determine if those applications can perform the desired conversions.   h.	Make recommendations to the government for performance parameters (technical language) necessary for future game engines to utilize geo-specific terrain adequate to build a technical specification with no proprietary issues. 3.	The contractor will be provided with a fully functional version of GM software and documentation ($219 online) and a fully functional and documented version of VBS1; (this will be provided by TECOM), samples of the NGA data (e.g., raster and vector map data) that are to be converted for use with VBS1, all licenses and software to be returned upon conclusion of work. 4.	Travel. Local travel may be required to TECOM at Marine Corps Base Quantico to gather VBS1 software and documentation and NGA data.  Local travel may also be required to meet with NGA employees to gather data.  No other travel is anticipated.   5.  Security. No security clearance is required. 6.  Time Requirement. The evaluation will be scheduled to take approximately four weeks.  If additional mapping software is to be evaluated, one week will be required to evaluate each software application.   7.  Place of Performance. The evaluation will be conducted at the contractor's facilities. 8.  Deliverables.  The contractor shall provide a report at appropriate times in the process defined in paragraphs above.  Final inspection and acceptance of all work performed, reports and other deliverables will be performed at the place of delivery by the COTR.        9.  Period of Performance- Date of award through 30 September 2005. 9. General Acceptance Criteria General quality measures, as set forth below, will be applied to each work product received    from the contractor under this statement of work.

<CONTACT>Heidi R. Muller Contracting Officer 2022190339     heidi_r_muller@nbc.gov;
<DESC>This is a concurrent Announcement/Request for Quotation (RFQ) #:   NBCQ05488, SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE US DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OFFICE OF INSULAR AFFAIRS seeks professional services to assist with Private Sector-led Economic Development in Insular Areas of Guam, American Samoa, The Northern Mariana Islands, Siapan, US Virgin Islands and the Freely Associated States of Micronesia.   Technical Offer instructions and Technical Evaluation Criteria are listed below.  After technical evaluation of Offers, DOI anticipates entering into a contract with the successful offeror.  The closing date of this concurrent Announcement/RFQ is:  Friday, 22 Jul 05, at 1630.  Please send questions by e-mail to the Contracting Officer at:   heidi_r_muller@nbc.gov.   This concurrent Announcement/RFQ incorporates by reference FAR Clauses 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5.  The assoicated Statement of Work has been included below. ___________________________ BACKGROUND On behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, the Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) is responsible for the general administration of the Federal Government's relationship with the U.S. insular areas of American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and for the administration of financial assistance to the freely associated states (FAS), the Marshall Islands, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia.  OIA provides and manages a number of grants in these locations.  In addition, OIA is responsible for certain aspects of the Secretary of the Interior's civil administration of Midway, Palmyra and Wake Atolls. Over the past two years, at the request of the Secretary of the Interior, OIA has organized two large conferences designed to introduce the mainland business community to the insular areas and FAS with the aim of stimulating private sector-led economic development.  Both of these events were highly successful, the second attracting over 1,000 attendees, and follow-up efforts are currently under way.  One such initiative will be Business Opportunities Missions, modeled on trade missions commonly led by the Department of Commerce and investment missions managed by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.  The first of these missions occurred in May 2005; fifteen businesses participated, and it included stops in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and Palau over a nine-day period.  OIA would like to lead business opportunities missions to other insular areas as well.  OIA's third Island Business Fellows program is under way, and another large-scale conference is likely in calendar year 2006.  The purpose of these initiatives is to follow up on the work of the initial conferences-to further develop the links between investors from Hawaii and the mainland United States and business and government leaders in the insular areas and FAS, with the ultimate aim of stimulating private sector-led economic development. Further and continuing follow-up efforts are also required throughout the year, beyond these large-scale events, to ensure that the links remain strong between, on the one hand, the insular areas and the FAS, and, on the other, Hawaii and the mainland United States.  A sustained effort and consistent outreach to the private sectors of both the islands and the mainland are required to ensure the success of this task.  OBJECTIVES The Contractor will assist OIA in pursuing our general goal of improving the level of private sector-led economic development in the insular areas and FAS, providing market research expertise, outreach assistance, and business development experience in support of this initiative. TASKS The Contractor shall provide the following consulting and development assistance tasks in support of OIA's economic development initiatives: Follow up on linkages between insular/FAS and Hawaii/mainland businesses created over the last two years and work towards the development of new linkages, with the ultimate aim of allowing all jurisdictions to benefit from win-win business opportunities.  These opportunities include: o  Development and promotion of insular/FAS exports to the U.S. customs territory and to other, foreign markets; o  Promotion of partnerships and new investment in the insular areas/FAS; and o  Development and promotion of new markets for U.S. goods and services in the insular areas and FAS. Assist OIA in its outreach efforts aimed at increasing awareness within the Hawaii/mainland business communities of opportunities that exist in the insular areas and FAS. Assist OIA in its efforts to increase and to support local capacity and to increase local awareness of available government and non-profit business assistance options. Assist and support specific OIA events, including future business opportunities missions and conferences. DELIVERABLES AND TIME FRAME The Contractor's services will be provided for an overall period of one year, from the date of award.  Close contact should be maintained at all times with representatives of OIA, as some deliverables will require close coordination with them.  Exact OIA contact information will be provided at time of award. DELIVERY SCHEDULE Work to increase awareness of opportunities in the insular areas and FAS in the American business community by completing the following: o  Beginning in August 2005, produce and deliver, along with a distribution list, a monthly newsletter focusing on trade and investment development in the insular areas and FAS for distribution to the U.S. and international business communities.  o  Beginning in August 2005, arrange at least five events, numbering between seventy and one hundred participants, for the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Insular Affairs, and other representatives of OIA, including at least one each in the Southwest or Hawaii, the Pacific Northwest and the eastern United States, aimed at building relationships with potential multiplier organizations and recruiting for future missions and conferences.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50052-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-04.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) plans to enter into a contract with an organization to provide literature review, interviews and site visits.  The North American Industry Classification code is 541990, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is NOT set-aside for small businesses.

Introduction:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), plans to enter into a contract for a preliminary review of information available about the safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, efficiency, timeliness, and equity of cancer care for the purposes of designing, implementing, and evaluating prototype delivery systems.  This contract will support literature review, site visits, case studies, and clinician group meetings.  Using a framework that outlines the objectives of cancer care, the overall focus of the project is to provide foundational information to guide the reliable translation of research evidence into practice.  A particular area of interest in this solicitation is the period of cancer care from suspicion of cancer through diagnosis and plan of care.

Background:  The mission of the National Cancer Institute is to eliminate death and suffering due to cancer.  From a health system perspective, this goal means  eliminating suffering from cancer and/or the effects of interventions and improving survival for patients whose cancer care the health system provides.  From a patient perspective, the goal can be more simply stated: “I get exactly the help I need, when I need it.”  To make such goals more specific, an appropriate starting place and statement of objectives for design of health care processes are the six aims for health care described by the Institute of Medicine.  These aims are applicable to cancer care though they must be further defined and operationalized.  Increasingly, oncologists, health services researchers, and national advisory committees have focused on the need to better understand systems of care including cancer care and at many levels including patient clinician decision making (e.g., clinical practice guidelines, evidence-based practice, accurate and complete pathology services), the flow of patients and information within and across settings of care; and the effects of external environmental factors, such as reimbursement and regulation, training.  Such understanding includes the effects of changes in these arenas on the outcomes of care that matter to patients and policymakers (e.g., clinical endpoints such as tumor shrinkage; survival, health-related quality of life, economic burden, patient experience of care).  In the field of oncology, the need for attention to care delivery, access, and costs is made more urgent because of the pipeline of new, complex, and costly technologies.  Such technologies include molecular medicine (e.g., genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, molecular imaging) and the anticipated need to tailor many possible diagnostic and therapeutic choices, in a variety of combinations for individual patients.  As in any field, new technologies in oncology bring the potential for error and patient harm as well as benefit.  The complexity of oncology care requires multidisciplinary input, the transfer of patient care across settings, departments, and specialty, and the loss of information about a patient or loss of follow-up of findings will occur unless careful attention is paid to the design of systems that minimizes these events now and in anticipation of advanced molecular and information technologies.  A major part of improving care delivery will rightly include a focus on creating safety systems such that current serious harms from, for example, a mis- or missed diagnosis, use of the wrong protocol or an error in implementing a protocol make the occurrence of adverse patient outcomes extremely unlikely not only in the short run, but also for survival and quality of life.  In addition, informatics and health information systems have the potential for making such information available to clinical settings, linking discovery, development and delivery more quickly.  Numerous studies have shown that even today, many patients throughout the United States do not receive optimal cancer care.  This requirement adopts the six Aims proposed by the Institute of Medicine.  That is, from a cancer care delivery perspective care should be:  Safe—avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them;  Effective—providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit (avoiding underuse and overuse, respectively);  Patient-centered—providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions;  Timely—reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care;  Efficient—avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy; and Equitable—providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.  Useful ideas, better data on the delivery of care, and a comprehensive approach to system change are needed to focus, motivate, and sustain substantial improvements.  Some published and much anecdotal evidence suggests considerable variation in quality, including the appropriate use of the best evidence, skill in diagnostic and treatment interventions; involving patients in decision making throughout the continuum of cancer care; and using data about practice to improve care processes.  However, it is difficult to obtain data that can be used to assess the quality and outcomes of patient care and to support the care process and quality improvement.  In addition, cancer patients often find the care system confusing and advice contradictory, identifying who is in charge of their care, and have trouble having their needs met.  The overall objective of the work is to identify barriers and facilitators of high quality cancer care; and identify innovative ideas for safer, and more effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable cancer care in the United States; including potential gains in each area from clinical information systems.  The contractor shall conduct a literature review (both peer-reviewed and “grey” literature) on the quality of cancer care; semi-structured individual and group discussions; and site visits to a selected set of cancer care service delivery organizations.  The purpose of the semi-structured discussions with key leaders and practicing clinicians and of the site visits to a variety of oncology settings is to learn from clinicians, senior leadership, health care experts, and patients about their views, gather information for improvement including innovations in care, safety-related issues, barriers to high quality care, and ideas for change, even if not already implemented.  The results of this work will inform future projects intended to design and implement systems to improve cancer care services.   The contractor shall synthesize finding of the literature review, discussions, and the site visits and present the findings and conclusions to the government for its use in designing cancer care prototypes.

<DESC>REQUIREMENTS FOR MICROWAVE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM

This is an amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation which superseded the Presolicitation Notice posted on 20 June 2005, FA7000-05-T-0121, and is for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The purpose of this amendment is to respond to the following questions:   

1.	We are unclear if the "common pedestal/turntable" located at the intersection is portable and is also the "pedestal" at the end of the add-on chamber, or if the "pedestal" is a separate piece of equipment.    


ANSWER: The requirements are for a 3-D positioner at the common intersection of the two chamber sections. The variable-height antenna mast is another piece of required equipment at the opposite end of the longest chamber section. USAFA already has a single axis positioner that must be mounted to the floor at the end of the “add-on” section of the chamber.

 
2.	Considering the intended use, the "common pedestal/turntable" might be just a raised turntable, and the "pedestal" could be the "multi-axis positioner for 3-dimensional antenna-pattern measurements".

ANSWER: See answer to Question 1. 
 
3.	For both the "common pedestal/turntable" and the "multi-axis positioner for 3-dimensional antenna-pattern measurements", required load capacities are needed.

ANSWER:  Load limit is 20 pounds minimum.

4. Please better define the microwave measurement system. Is there any existing equipment that needs to be integrated into this system?   

ANSWER: The following equipment must be integrated into the system:
	FR 8502 Positioner Programmer/controller
	FR 959 Signal Distribution Unit
	FR 8601A Power Amplifier
	HP 8510C Network Analyzer
	HP 8511 Frequency Converter
	HP 8514B S-parameter Test Set
	HP 8349B Microwave Amplifier
	HP 11713A Attenuator/Switch Driver
	HP 83621A Synthesized Sweeper

5. Please give us a detailed description of what is to be accomplished in this facility. What EMC or Antenna measurement standards are to be met?

ANSWER:  Annotated in the SOW. 

6. Do you want to measure Radio Patterns or are you trying to  measure EMC?    

ANSWER:  Not sure what “Radio Patterns” refers to. If antenna patterns is meant, then the answer is “yes. The answer to EMC measurements is also “yes”. 

7. Do you have an existing capability that you are trying to duplicate? If so please describe this for us.

ANSWER:  No existing capability duplication.  


Offers must be received NLT Noon, Mountain Daylight Savings Time, 22 July 2005.  Quotes can be emailed to debra.mccraw@usafa.af.mil or faxed to Debra McCraw at 719-333-9103.  Offers received after this date and time will be considered late in accordance with 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated.

Questions & Answers received for solicitation R-OPC-22878 Shuttle Bus Services

1. Q:  Is the contract driver a FTE that needs to be available 5 days a week? A:  Yes. However, because the driver’s tour of duty is for 13 hours per day, a second driver would be permitted; but no more than 2 drivers during the 13-hour per day tour of duty.

2. Q:  Regarding the matter of Additional Services – how can the pricing for these additional services be evaluated without the use of estimated hours?  What is the estimate of hours that should be used in CLIN 0002? A:  We anticipate that the contract relief driver would be needed to supplement staff, while the  motor pool drivers and dispatcher are on annual or sick leave and two weeks during congressional hearings.  Assuming that each member of the motor pool take two weeks annual leave, and congressional hearings requires an additional driver for 2 weeks, a contract driver would be needed for approximately 320 hours annually.  Sick leave would be a variable but could add as much as another 120 hours total.  

3. Q:  According to the scope of work: Shuttle Bus 19 plus passenger bus. Is it a 19 passenger including the ADA lift? A:  No.  ADA lift is in addition to the 19 passengers. Current shuttle bus is a 22-passenger plus ADA lift.


4. Q: What happens if a stop is not missed but late yet an employee deems it missed if they return to their office or find other transportation? A: Each run is 20 minutes.  If the shuttle is 10 minutes or more late, it will be considered a missed run.  

5. Q: Will the Project Manager have an office at HUD. A: No.

6.  Q: Who has the risk for the Motor Pool Vehicles in the contract-for liability?  Who has the risk of loss to GSA when a contractor’s employee is operating the GSA vehicle on behalf of the Agency? A: The contractor will be responsible for any damages to Non-GSA leased vehicles or law suites  resulting from an accident where the contract driver is found to be at fault or negligent.  The government will be responsible to make repairs or recovery of repair costs from the responsible party to vehicles driven by the contract driver as a result of accidents where the contract driver is found to not be at fault.  The GSA vehicles leased will be driven by Government personnel only.  Driving GSA leased vehicles will not be a requirement of this contract, therefore, liability for accidents involving GSA vehicles becomes a non-issue with regard to this task.

7. Q:  Are technical proposals required in addition to cost proposals, or are only cost proposals required? A:  Yes, technical proposals are required in addition to the cost proposal addressing the evaluation factors that were identified in the solicitation.




8. Q: Is HUD willing to accept a price adjustment clause in the contract for option years for materials  such as gas given it’s critical component of pricing and it’s great fluxation in recent months.  Are there ranges acceptable to the government? A: No

9. Q: Is there an incumbent? A: Yes.

10. Q: If So, Who? A:  VGA, Inc.  Any additional information must be requested through Freedom of Information Act, (FOIA). The address to request a FOIA is: Housing Urban Development, 451 7th Street, SW, Office of General Counsel (OGC/FOIA) Room 10248.

11. Q:  May we deliver the response to proposals electronically via e-mail or would you prefer a hard copy delivered to your office? A:  Please provide one (1) original and three (3) hard copies delivered to the address provided in the solicitation at HUD. 

12. Q: Can the vehicle be a 16 + 2 with ADA? A: No, the solicitation states 19 plus passenger bus with ADA lift. (Please read Q&A number 3)
