<DESC>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability and type of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting this potential government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.   Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method including small business socio-economic set-aside possibilities and to determine the availability of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting the Government's potential requirement.  All Small Business companies with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background.<br />The Division of Behavioral and Social Research (BSR) at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans, conducts, fosters, and supports an integrated and coordinated program of research and research training with emphasis placed on: (1) the dynamic interplay among individuals as they age; (2) their changing biomedical, social, and physical environments; and (3) multilevel interactions among psychological, physiological, social, and cultural levels.  Research areas of emphasis are: (1) Health Disparities; (2) Aging Minds; (3) Increasing Health Expectancy; (4) Health, Work, and Retirement; (5) Interventions and Behavior Change; (6) Genetics, Behavior, and the Social Environment; and (7) The Burden of Illness and the Efficiency of Health Systems.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives.<br />The purpose of this potential requirement is to provide contractor services of a Behavioral Geneticist/Genetic Epidemiologist to advise on integrating genetics and genomics with the behavioral sciences, specifically in aging research.  BSR's interests in genetics cover diverse methodological applications and a broad range of phenotypes, including cognition, life expectancy, survival, and disability, as well as social aspects, sociability, economic behaviors, risk-taking, conscientiousness, and various motivations.  BSR's portfolio of twin research is positioned to yield new insights by applying novel molecular and quantitative methodologies to the twin design. BSR is also building research using population genetics. BSR is enhancing its investment in large social/behavioral surveys by pursuing GWAS strategies and developing harmonization strategies that will maximize the use of genetic data for well-planned behavioral and social science studies.</p>
<p>Project requirements. <br />The National Advisory Council on Aging (NACA) encouraged increased emphasis on the following components in which this potential requirement may need support:  (1) Using sophisticated strategies developing valid, reliable, well-defined, and standardized phenotypic measures in behavioral and social research to close the gap between genotype and behavioral phenotypes; (2) Developing opportunities for leveraging the specific and particular advantages of genotyped BSR cohorts (e.g., the extensive longitudinal data available in many studies, the population representativeness of the HRS); (3) Supporting method development to optimize the comparison and integration of heterogeneous data sets, both within and across populations and across omics technologies; (4) Supporting infrastructure for individual studies and for the harmonization of and analyses across cohorts, where the administrative burden in running successful collaborative efforts is especially high. <br /> <br />Capability statements sought<br />Respondents must provide a Capability Statement as part of their response that includes information on:  (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work (c) prior completed contractor support roles of similar nature, including any government contracts and/or contracts with commercial entities; and (d) experience and management capability as it relates to the functions described in this notice. Responses must include the respondents' DUNS number, company name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business pursuant to the NAICS code identified in this announcement.</p>
<p>Other related information in the Capability Statement may include: Respondents' opinion as to the perceived difficulty and/or feasibility of this requirement or proposed acquisition; possible solutions and approaches that may currently exist in the marketplace; and information regarding innovative ideas or concepts as they relate to the development of a potential solicitation.</p>
<p>Capability Statements shall be limited to 15 pages and submitted in response to this notice no later than the closing date specified in this announcement as an attached Adobe PDF or Microsoft Office file via email to hunter.tjugum@nih.gov. Respondents should include their technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>CONCLUDING STATEMENTS<br />Disclaimer and Important Notes. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
