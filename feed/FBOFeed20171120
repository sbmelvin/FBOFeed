<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-17-01132 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i) Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

(iii) Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail. Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

DESCRIPTION:<br />INTRODUCTION<br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to solicit by a request for quotation from Beckton, Dickenson and Company DBA US BD Biosciences on or around November 30, 2017. The purpose of this purchase order will be to provide the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) with Maintenance Support Services for a Custom LSR II Flow Cytometer.</p>
<p><br />NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE and SET ASIDE STATUS<br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 811219 with a Size Standard of $20.5 Million.</p>
<p>This acquisition is NOT set aside for small businesses.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements. FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source provides that: For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, Contracting officers may solicit from one source IF the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name OR industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-85 dated February 26, 2016.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT<br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<br />The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase maintenance services to support a Custom BD LSR II flow cytometer used by the NINDS Laboratory of Viral Immunology and Intravital Imaging (VIIIS). To ensure standardization of research data and continuation of equipment warranties, maintenance may only be performed by the original equipment manufacturer, BD Biosciences.<br />The Viral Immunology and Intravital Imaging Section (VIIIS) of NINDS studies inflammatory diseases processes in the brain induced by injury or infection. As part of this research, the laboratory needs to monitor and quantify expression of various inflammatory biomolecules on cells extracted from various tissues, including brain, spleen, lymph nodes, blood, liver, etc. This type of analysis provides a signature of the inflammatory disease process underway and aids in the evaluation of therapeutic interventions. <br />The Custom BD LSR II is a critical piece of equipment in the VIIIS that is essential to the NINDS mission. The VIIIS requires a service contract for the BD LSR II Flow Cytometer to ensure that the instrument is properly maintained and quickly repaired should a service issue arise. Having a BD LSR II service contract in place helps sustain an uninterrupted research flow within the VIIIS.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:<br />Contractor must be an Authorized Service Provider of the FACSAriaII flow cytometer (Serial Number H47100213) equipment that provides an OEM Service Technician and Certified Parts for maintenance support services as follows:<br />Contractor shall perform two (2) preventive maintenance inspections during each twelve-month period.

Inspections must comply with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) equipment manuals.<br />Contractor shall provide unlimited technical support (telephone) and service repairs at no additional cost to the Government. If technical support is unsuccessful, contactor shall provide a service technician on-site within 48 hours. All repairs under warranty must comply with OEM equipment manuals. <br />Contractor shall provide preventative maintenance, service repairs and technical support between the hours of 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM, Bethesda, MD local prevailing time, Monday through Friday. Emergency service repairs and technical support must be provided as needed, based on MD local prevailing time, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays.<br />Contractor shall provide OEM certified parts for all preventative maintenance and service repairs, except for consumables, at no additional cost to the Government. Shipping and handling parts under warranty or contract shall not be charged to the Government. <br />Contractor shall provide an OEM service technician to perform all preventive maintenance inspections, service repairs and technical support.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br />The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, US BD Biosciences is the only vendor in the marketplace that can provide the products required by NINDS.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR part 10, extensive market research was conducted to reach this determination. Specifically, a sources sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps referencing the above detailed requirements and no responses were received. Additionally, contacts with knowledgeable individuals both in industry and Government, as well as reviews of available product literature, revealed no other sources. Finally, a review of the GSA Advantage, Dynamic Small Business Search, and previous government acquisitions returned no results that meet all of the requirements. Therefore, only US BD Biosciences is capable of meeting the needs of this requirement.</p>
<p>The intended source is:<br />US BD Biosciences<br />2350 Qume Dr.<br />San Jose, CA 95131</p>

The FSSC RPO, whose mission it is to support ROTHR system operations, acts in all activities associated with support of the ROTHR System, including hardware/software configuration management, upgrade installation and Installation Verification and Validation (IV and V), system enhancement development, system performance diagnostics, Pre-Program-Product-Improvement (PPPI), ROTHR non-procurable parts re-engineering, ROTHR system logistic support, ROTHR-related budget and cost/benefit support, ROTHR system development, execution and upgrade, and coordination of ROTHR System improvements with international Over-the-Horizon Radar (OTHR) system efforts and other functions.
  The FSSC RPO requires contractor services in support of this RPO mission.

ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM 330, ARCHITECT ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  THERE IS NO SEPARATE RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.
                                                                                                                                                                       A. INTRODUCTION: This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract that is being procured in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers Statute (Public Law 92-582), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.6, VA Acquisition Regulation 836.6 and Public Law 109-461.  Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms, as there is a reasonable expectation that two or more offers from SDVOSB firms will be received as a result of this notice. 

This announcement is NOT a request for proposal. NO solicitation package will be issued until after an evaluation has been made on the submitted SF 330s. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. Any requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. No material will be issued and no solicitation package or bidder/plan holder list will be issued.

B. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Network Contracting Office (NCO) 23, is seeking to acquire AE Design, Construction, Historic Preservation and other Design Services that follow all local, federal and state regulations and guidelines.  These services are essential for the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide high quality and cost effective facilities in support of our nation's Veterans. The Minneapolis Construction Team s key customers are, but not limited to the Minneapolis and St. Cloud Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and their VA Community Clinics (formerly known as Community Based Outpatient Clinics) which proudly work at the front lines of service delivery.

The VA anticipates awarding up to five (5) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside IDIQ AE contracts for work within Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Fixed-Price (FFP) contracts will be negotiated and awarded for a base period of one (1) year plus four one (1) year option periods.  The amount of the contract awarded to each SDVOSB firm will have a total contract capacity of $10,000,000.00 over the life of the contract. The minimum guarantee amount shall be $1,000.00 for this contract.  The contract is anticipated to be awarded in 2018 and completed in 2023.

AE services will be acquired by the issuance of Task Orders against this contract for work within the boundaries of the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 23. (See the attached Map for VA locations within Minnesota and Wisconsin). In accordance with FAR 52.216-19 - Order Limitations, the minimum order shall not be below $1,000.00 and the maximum single order shall not be greater than $2,000,000.00.  If remaining capacity falls below $1,000.00, the Government will consider the contract complete. 

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICs) codes for this acquisition are Architect or Architect/Engineer firms with an approved NAICS Code of 541310   Architectural Services, with a small business size standard of $7,500,000.00 in average annual receipts and 541330   Engineering Services, with a small business size standard of $15,000,000.00 in average annual receipts. 

To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. Representations and Certifications must be completed electronically via this site.  Register via the SAM Internet site at www.sam.gov or by contacting the SAM Customer Service at 1-866-606-8220.  

Firms must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status and ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz.gov at the time SF 330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal and SF 330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a lower rating.  NOTE: Past performance information should be provided only for projects listed under Criterion 1.
SUBMIT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION FOR EACH PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1.  IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion   1.

<p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/PZIBC Base Support Contracting Branch, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking capabilities packages of potential sources including Small Business (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only, to identify potential sources capable of providing Hotel Rooms to the 711th HPW in Baltimore, Maryland in accordance with the requirements of industry standards and applicable local, state, and Federal laws.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: The Draft Requirements Document has all of the information listed in regards to the technical requirements for this project. As a reminder, these are drafts and estimates which are subject to be changed.</p>

<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 721110 - Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels, with a size standard of $32.5M. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates an acquisition for a Firm Fixed Price Contract, with a period of performance of 1 Jan 2018- 30 Jun 2018.</p>

Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attention All potential respondents: If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement.

If human and animal contact has occurred it may be required to provide the captured animal to the County Department of Health for testing. 

Insect Control:
Non-pesticide Methods of Control: The Contractor shall use non-pesticide methods of control wherever possible. For Example:
Portable vacuums rather than pesticide sprays shall be used for initial cleanouts of cockroach infestations, for swarming (winged) ants and termites, and for control of spiders in webs wherever appropriate.
Trapping devices rather that pesticide sprays shall be used for indoor fly control wherever appropriate

Application of Insecticides to Cracks and Crevices: As a general rule, the Contractor shall apply all insecticides as  crack and crevice  treatments only, defined in the contract as treatments in which the formulated insecticide is not visible to a bystander during or after the application process.

A copy of the diagram shall be given to the EMS Office. All traps shall be placed discretely and not to interrupt staff or patient care.

Use of Rodenticides: In exceptional circumstances, when rodenticides are deemed essential for adequate rodent control inside occupied buildings, the contractor shall obtain the approval of the COR prior to making any interior rodenticide treatment.  All rodenticides, regardless of packaging, shall be placed either in locations not accessible to children, pets, wildlife, and domestic animals, or in EPA approved tamper-resistant bait boxes.  As a general rule, rodenticide application outside buildings shall emphasize the direct treatment of rodent burrows wherever feasible.

Use of Bait Boxes: Frequency of bait box servicing shall depend upon the level of rodent infestation.  All bait boxes shall be maintained in accordance with EPA regulations, with an emphasis on the safety of non-target organisms. The Contractor shall adhere to the following five points:

All bait boxes shall be placed out of the general view, in locations where they will not be disturbed by routine operations.

Reporting:  A rodent diagram will be included in the service log book. All bait stations will be locked and secured. All traps and bait stations will be dated during monthly inspection and log sheets will note the conditions found during the time of service.

General Requirements:

Interference To Normal Function:   Contractor personnel are required to interrupt their work at any time so as not to interfere with the normal functioning of any VAWNY areas, including utility services, fire protection systems and passage of facility patients, personnel, visitors, equipment and carts.

Use of Pesticides: The Contractor shall be responsible for application of pesticides according to the label. All pesticides used by the Contractor must be registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<DESC>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />Notice Number: HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-ETSB-1000-87<br />Title: Integrative Epidemiological Studies<br />NAICS Code: The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990. The small business size standard is $15M
<p>Type of Notice:<br />This is a Small Businesses Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The mission of Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch (ITEB) is to advance understanding of cancer etiology and progression through integrative analyses of environmental and germline risk factors with comprehensive data on histological and molecular profiling of tumors and their precursors, including somatic genomic analyses. The branch also develops methods to support this cutting-edge research.</p>
<p>ITEB employs molecular pathology, somatic and germline genomics, and epidemiology to identify environmental and germline risk factors for cancer. The ITEB research program includes case-control, cohort, family, and cross-sectional studies. Investigators in the branch also participate in and contribute to national and international organizations and consortia to promote research on environmental risk factors and the germline and somatic contribution to cancer etiology. They conduct studies using tissue imaging, digital pathology, automated image analysis, and molecular/genomic analyses of tissues to comprehensively characterize features of normal, precursor and tumor tissues. Branch members and their collaborators develop and use computational tools to integrate and analyze high-dimensional data to link germline and environmental exposures to molecular features of cancer and precursor lesions, including somatic genomic signatures of risk factors, particularly those with high attributable risk.</p>
<p>Research conducted by ITEB investigators involves:</p>
<p>- Design, conduct and analysis of molecular epidemiology studies with tissue collections.<br />- Characterization of tumors using morphology, histopathology and immunohistochemistry/in situ hybridization staining and scoring of tissue slides from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) or fresh frozen (FF) material. <br />- Molecular profiling of tumors, including genomic analyses conducted at the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory (CGRL) and external laboratories.<br />- Design and use of large-scale analytic tools for integrated data analytics of high dimensional, complex data. <br />- Use of publicly available data from resources such as the National Institute of Health (NIH) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), ENCODE and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) projects, and the International cancer genome consortium (ICGC). <br />- Participation and contribution to large national and international consortia.<br />- Development of nodes of excellence in molecular pathology and somatic analyses that will accelerate similar research across other branches.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:<br />This non R&amp;D support services contract is essential for ITEB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate quantitative exposure assessment and molecular epidemiology to provide new insights into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. The National Cancer Institute NCI/ITEB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for occupational and environmental epidemiologic studies, including support for exposure assessment and molecular components, and coordination of activities related to genome-wide association studies (GWAS); and in conducting and simultaneously managing concurrent, multiple, large (including international) epidemiologic investigations of cancer etiology.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:<br />A copy of the draft Statement of Work (SOW) pertaining to this requirement, which is subject to revisions, is attached to this notice.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance:<br />The anticipated period of performance inclusive of options, for this proposed acquisition is December 20, 2019 - December 19, 2024. A single award is anticipated.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC EXWC) Explosion Effects and Consequence Division provides solutions and services in the areas of explosives safety, blast effects analysis, and protective construction design to activities and agencies across the Department of Defense (DoD). One of the primary components that NAVFAC EXWC supports is the Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB), who maintains and improves the standards for storing, handling and maintaining explosives within the Military Services worldwide. This work statement is to provide engineering services to NAVFAC EXWC in three of the support areas that are currently being provided to DDESB: the Risk Assessment Program, the DDESB Science Panel, and DoD Protective Construction..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; mso-outline-level: 1"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">2.0<span style="mso-tab-count: 2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BACKGROUND </span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">In December 1999, the RBESCT recommended and the DDESB approved the use of the Technical Paper (TP) 14 quantitative risk assessment model and DoD risk acceptance criteria for a 3-year trial period. The trial period for explosives safety risk-based siting was periodically extended until the methodology was officially adopted and incorporated into the Department of Defense (DoD) explosives safety manual DoD 6055.09-M. The DoD Components are authorized by DoD 6055.09-M to apply the guidance and criteria for submitting DoD risk-based explosives safety site plans to the DDESB for review and approval.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">In January 2007, the DDESB Chairman approved the DDESB Science Panel as a DDESB Working Group. Initially the Science Panel was a subpanel of the RBESCT that developed the physical science and consequence algorithms and conducted test programs to support the development of TP-14 and the DDESB risk-based siting software tool SAFER. The applicability of the resulting test data transcends risk-based criteria and applies to other standards, i.e., Quantity-Distance (QD) standards. To accommodate the Science Panel addressing broader applications, the decision was made to transform the RBESCT subpanel to a DDESB Working Group. The Science Panel continues to support the RBESCT, as well as the DoD Explosives Safety Testing Steering Group (DDESTSG) and other DDESB-sponsored endeavors. In recent years, the RBESCT transformed into the Risk Assessment Program to take on the broader scope of supporting explosives safety risk assessment across the Services through Explosives Safety Munitions Risk Management (ESMRM). </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">In 2012, work began on merging the DDESB's risk-based siting methodologies into DDESB's Automated Site Planner (ASP) tool. DDESB's ASP tool is the Explosives Safety Siting (ESS) software, and has been developed based on requirements defined by the Services. The primary requirement was to link non-graphic facilities and explosives data to facilities represented in electronic maps, and then develop an automated process to access that information and evaluate it against automated explosives safety siting regulations that specify minimum required separation distances between a Potential Explosion Site (PES) facility and its surrounding facilities. The geospatial relationships provided by the mapping data and explosives information already stored within ESS will be used for the risk-based siting tool.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Whereas ESS implements the QD requirements defined within DoD 6055.09-M and the other Component level explosives safety criteria, the current risk-based siting tool implements the methods defined within TP-14 and other relevant documents. Both DoD 6055.09-M and TP-14 are updated periodically as the state of the art in explosives safety knowledge advances.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">UFC 3-340-02 is the approved design and analysis manual for protective construction required to demonstrate equivalent explosives safety protection. DDESB is chair of the UFC 3-340-02 Technical Working Group (TWG) and works to continuously update the manual. Additionally, they are also have final determination regarding the compliance of structures and systems providing reduced QD, either via testing or analysis. </span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The DDESB Science Panel has conducted numerous explosives safety related tests over the past decade. Explosives safety testing support of government run and lead tests, including data collection, drafting of test plans, data analysis, report generation, and interpretation of results is required. DDESB Science Panel support shall also include technical support of meetings. Typically, there will be one in-person meeting per year, in addition to telecons every other month. Assignments will be as directed per task order, based on the TP-14 priority list as determined by the RBESCT and the DDESB Science Panel, as well as other explosives safety-related tasking. It is also required to provide support to the DDESB Science Panel in the Klotz Group, an international group of subject matter experts on explosion produced debris and consequences, as well as in NATO subject matter expert technical working groups, such as AC/326 Subgroup C and the AASTP-4 Risk Analysis Working Group. Various explosives safety documentation, as outlined in Section 4, will require upkeep and maintenance at periodic intervals, which will require Science Panel support as needed.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Protective Construction support for the DDESB generally falls into one of two categories: 1) updates and enhancements to UFC 3-340-02 or 2) design and demonstration of reduced quantity distance (QD) structures or solutions. UFC 3-340-02 is the required DoD design manual for protective construction when the QD requirements of DoD 6055.09-M cannot be satisfied, and the UFC 3-340-02 Technical Working Group leads the ongoing effort to update and enhance the document. Updates include ensuring compliance with a variety of other related structural documents, whereas enhancements entails sufficiently demonstrating either via testing or analysis that new technologies are sufficiently adequate for incorporation into design code under intensive blast loading. Whereas UFC 3-340-02 supports design and analysis of site specific scenarios subjected to blast loads from potential accidental explosions, DDESB TP-15 defines a series of standard structure designs that have a prescribed reduced QD associated with them. These are demonstrated either analysis or testing, and require periodic update. In addition to support of reduced QD designs, testing or analysis to support other protective construction design is required, such as assistance with development of substantial dividing wall criteria or HD 1.3 structural design criteria.</span></p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, BUT RATHER A SOURCES SOUGHT that will allow the Government to identify interested sources capable of meeting the requirement.  The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for quote (RFQ), Request for proposal (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB), or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of information submitted in response to the Sources Sought.  The Government does not intend to nor will it be required to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought.  The Government will not pay for any costs incurred by any respondent associated with providing information in response to this request.  This notice is for market research purposes only and is not indicative of a full requirement.<br /><br />The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Technology Application Contracting Office (TAKO) is interested in identifying potential vendors who have the necessary capabilities to provide turreted, electro-optical sensor systems for various rotary wing aircraft.  The sensor solutions shall provide imaging in the following spectrums: daylight, SWIR, and MWIR; the system shall also have sensitivity in the NIR spectrum for viewing existing aircraft and ground force beacons, strobes and markers.  In addition, the sensor shall provide a laser pointer, a laser illuminator, an eye-safe laser range-finder, and a laser spot tracker.  Targeting versions of the turret will need to provide a laser designator with boresight capability resident on the turret.  Potential suppliers will provide substantiation to demonstrate their sensors meet or exceed the requirements in MIL-810-G, MIL-STD-461 and MIL-STD-704 for manned rotary wing aircraft.  No development will be funded by the government.<br /><br />Three types of aircraft will be using the sensor system, and will be configured in either targeting or non-targeting variants.  The preference is for a single common turret form factor with two configurations; one designating and one non-designating that will be used on all aircraft.  However, based on weight and performance requirements of various aircraft, a second turret form factor may be required. In order for the solution to be a single common turret form factor for all aircraft types, then the proposed system must weigh under 75 pounds, be 15 inches or less in height, and 19 inches or less in width.  The MWIR for this turret will have a Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference (NETD) of 45mK or better, and a cut-off spatial frequency of 14.0 cycles/mrad or better.<br /><br />One targeting aircraft variant is driving the overall system performance requirement.  This one platform could accept a system weight of up to 150 pounds, and a height of up to 19 inches, if the required performance for resolution, sensitivity and designation is not capable in a 75 pound package.<br /><br />The other platforms, both targeting and non-targeting, drive the weight and size limits.  These platforms could accept a lesser designation capability, an NETD of 65mK or better, and a cut-off spatial frequency of 11.0 cycles/mrad or better.<br /><br />USSOCOM intends to perform a formal flight evaluation of potential turrets on a representative aircraft in the summer of 2019.  The government will provide facilities for informal ground and flight evaluation prior to the summer of 2019 for any vendors willing to provide hardware at no cost to the government.  In order to participate in the evaluation, suppliers will need to provide operational and/or lab test reports sufficient to substantiate an Air-Worthiness Release (AWR) for a test flight on the aircraft.  The government will provide interface requirements, a test plan, and the test platform (including the display).  The potential suppliers will provide the sensor system, controller and operator.<br /><br />Potential sources are requested to submit a brief summary of their capabilities along with their systems capability, size, weight, power and interface information.<br /><br />All interested, capable, and responsible sources that would like to respond to this sources sought are encouraged to provide a statement of interest along with supporting data via email to Aaron Martin at aaron.b.martin12.civ@mail.mil no later than 1600 Eastern Time on 26 January 2018.  Once the sources sought requirement has closed, the Government will contact individual responders for any further information required.

<DESC>SUBJECT: Request for Information - Grounds Maintenance Services
<p>1. <strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY</strong>. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute as a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking quotations and will not accept unsolicited offers. Interested vendors are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal<br />Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: https://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>FAR 52.215-3 Request for Information of Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)</p>
<p>(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI.<br />(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br />(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of market research.</p>
<p>2. The 7th Contracting Squadron (7 CONS) is conducting market research to identify <strong>potential 8(a) contractors</strong> that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to provide grounds maintenance services at Dyess AFB. The NAICS code for this effort is 561730, Landscaping Services. The draft performance work statement (PWS) includes further details and expected workload.</p>
<p>3. The information that is gathered from this RFI will be used to form a formal RFP at a later time. Responders should answer all the following questions in as much detail as possible:</p>
<p><br />a. Do you have any suggestions or questions regarding the attached draft PWS?</p>
<p>b. The government is contemplating awarding this requirement as an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity Firm-Fixed-Price contract. One-time services (such as services listed in Section 1.8 of the Draft PWS) would be awarded via task order once quantity or need is determined. Would the type of contract selected for the award affect your pricing?</p>
<p>4. The aforementioned information along with interest and capability statements are requested to be provided <strong>no later than 11 December 2017</strong> via e-mail to SrA Elvia Arellano at elvia.arellano@us.af.mil and Capt Erika Thornton at erika.thornton.1@us.af.mil. Any questions must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the aforementioned personnel.</p>
<p>5. The information that is received from this RFI will be used to make the best decision on how to proceed with this acquisition. All information will be kept within the 7th Contracting Squadron, and will not be shared with any other potential offerors. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please contact SrA Elvia Arellano at elvia.arellano@us.af.mil (Phone: 325-696-2679), SrA Jonneisha McNabb at jonneisha.mcnabb@us.af.mil (Phone: 325-696-5261), or Capt Erika Thornton at erika.thornton.1@us.af.mil (Phone: 325-696-2353.)</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) intends to modify the three Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts under Information Technology Enterprise Solutions - Software (ITES-SW) to increase the shared ceiling by $139,000,000.00 from $49,000,000 to $179,000,000.00. <br /><br />The ITES-SW scope remains unchanged. The ITES-SW contracts provide commercially available-off-the-shelf (COTS) software products and maintenance that have obtained a full Certificate of Networthiness (CoN) through the US Army's Network Command (NETCOM) networthiness process in the four following NETCOM categories: IT Utility and Security, Modeling and Simulation, Multimedia and Design, Program and Development. Only software and software maintenance not available on another Enterprise Software Initiative agreement can be offered on an ITES-SW contractor's catalog. The ITES-SW contractors must have a Letter of Authorization from each Software Publisher whose products are included on their ITES-SW catalogs. The proposed contract action is for software and maintenance for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate only with ITES-SW contractors under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.
<p>The current contracts are scheduled to expire on 10 February 2020. The increased ceiling will provide for uninterrupted deliveries to Army only customers through the end of the period of performance. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Not awarding this extension would cause serious harm to the Government; however, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the date and time identified. Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source extension described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of Jill Sommer, the Contracting Officer. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to Ms. Angeline Graff at angeline.a.graff.civ@mail.mil or Ms. Jill Sommer at jill.m.sommer.civ@mail.mil, no later than 2:00 PM Central Time, 2 November 2017.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7490-00-NIB-0051<br />Name:		Lamination Machine, Office, 3-5Mil Pouches, 18.5" L x 6.38" W x 3.06" H, 3.75 lbs, Black and Silver<br />Description:	Office Lamination Machine laminates documents up to 12.5" wide with 3mil and 5mil pouches. Simple one touch user interface activates the machine which features an anti-jam lever for release and pouch realignment and auto shut off. Laminator has a 4 minute warm-up with a visual ready indicator and 12" per minute throughput. 18.5" L x 6.38" W x 3.06" H. Color is black and silver. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7490-00-NIB-0051<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	SWI1703075; FEL5736601; FEL5729101; BSN 20875; FEL5726301; SWI1703073; FEL 5739701</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no adverse impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please visit http://abilityone.gov/distributors/potential.html for more information.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.

<SUBJECT>R--Marine CSI Workshop in Malaysia
<SOLNBR>140F0918Q0011
<CONTACT>DeLawder, Sarah
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Contracting and General Services in Falls Church, VA intends to award to RFB Services, 1524 Akahele Pl, Kailua, HI 96734 for a marine wildlife crime scene investigation workshop in Malaysia.  The objective of this work is to develop wildlife law enforcement capacity in relevant government authorities to improve national and transborder wildlife interception, investigation, and prosecution.  The marine wildlife crime scene investigation workshop will support efforts to recognize the importance of coordinating U.S. Government efforts and resources to address wildlife trafficking globally, as established by an Executive Order on Combating Wildlife Trafficking (E.O. 13648).  This E.O. established an interagency Task Force and directed the development of a strategy to guide efforts to end illegal wildlife trade.  RFB Services is the only vendor capable of completing this workshop.  RFB Services has previously partnered with other U.S. Government agencies to teach this workshop and it is essential to have consistent training globally for the individuals participating in marine crime scene investigation.  RFB Services has the necessary past performance, familiarity with scientific/technical aspects of the workshop, familiarity with marine wildlife, and experience in planning and executing an international workshop in a tropical marine environment.  RFB Services has recently facilitated a similar workshop in Indonesia in support of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Project and this is intended to be a replicate of that training for a different audience.  The consistency and continuity afforded by this vendor, who has designed specific training tools (such as 4 foot wood simulation of a sea turtle), is important.  In addition, they recently supported the U.S. Navy project in Malaysia and have the necessary familiarity with the country, relevant government and NGO actors, which gives them an understanding of the local environment.  Lastly, RFB Services has demonstrated a track record of ensuring the safety of workshop participants in an in-water environment, which is very important.

The proposed contract is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  

All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability for this requirement by responding to this announcement. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>Remote Sensing and Geospatial Technology Support Services
<SOLNBR>1284JC18R0001
<RESPDATE>120817
<CONTACT>Mary Shinney, Contracting Officer, Phone 8019753783, Email mshinney@fs.fed.us
<DESC><strong>Purpose:</strong> The Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC) Contracting Office, is seeking industry feedback regarding on the proposed acquisition approach, Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure, and pricing methodology for the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Technology Support Services (RSGTSS) requirement currently under consideration. [Note: This acquisition replaces the canceled requirement that was posted under FedBizOps number AG-84M8-S-16-0005.] <br />
<p><strong><br />Requirement:</strong> The RSGTSS contract provides professional remote sensing and geospatial services for the Forest Service. Services include: geospatial technology evaluation; research and development; geospatial training and technical support; sample design and accuracy assessment; resource inventory, mapping, and monitoring; minor programming and development of geospatial applications; geospatial help desk support, and geospatial information technology management. The anticipated contract vehicle is a single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract for a period of five (5) years.</p>
<p><strong>Draft Solicitation:</strong> Interested companies may review the attached draft solicitation and attachments. Please provide any feed-back, questions, areas of concern, or possible document improvements in order that the contemplated acquisition will be easily understood by all potential sources and will reflect the best practices of commercial companies while adhering to both statutory and regulatory mandates. It is anticipated that the formal solicitation will be released as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The Government is not bound to the information contained in the draft documents; however, it is anticipated that the final will be similar to this draft.</p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong> Additionally, the Government requests interested companies provide responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. The lease for GTAC's current location is expected to expire approximately January 2019. Due to federal leasing requirements, GTAC will be relocated during this time to another location within the Salt Lake Valley. Any on-site contract staff will accompany GTAC in the new facility. The Government will not reimburse the contractor for company relocation and the contractor will be responsible for all moving costs (including labor) associated with moving company/employee items. Costs associated with pre or post-move effort (e.g. tear down/building/modifying support structures for remote sensing and geospatial IT systems, gearing down and getting systems back up and running, troubleshooting, etc.), may be considered within the scope of the contract and will be ordered via task order issuance. Given the fact that the current incumbent contract expires in November 2018, what risks or considerations does the Government need to evaluate in conjunction with this organizational relocation? (Note: The Government is planning to exercise clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services under the incumbent contract and extend performance until approximately 31 January 2019.)<br />2. What is the optimal plan for on-going work under task orders issued under the current incumbent contract?<br />3. What should the estimated timeframe be for transition from the incumbent contractor?<br />4. Is industry amenable to pricing one (1) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) lot/each for transition from incumbent contractor (if required)? What labor or type of activities would be included in the transition price?<br />5. This contract contains work that may be deemed Mission Essential. Some key labor positions may be required to be on-call for emergency response situations. What is the best way to handle emergency work under this effort? Currently the draft solicitation calls for a ceiling labor rate - will this escalate the cost to the Government, considering emergency situations are rare/few? Should the Government include a separate emergency rate for some key labor positions and if so, which positions?<br />6. Are the pricing arrangements listed (FFP and Time and Material (T&amp;M)) the best possible method to competitively price this requirement?<br />7. The Government anticipates that work ordered under this contract will be approximately 85% T&amp;M in nature and approximately 15% FFP. Given the planned work split, what is the best method to evaluate offerors' Total Evaluated Price and ensure cost control under the resulting contract? Currently the draft solicitation calls for a ceiling labor rate - will this escalate the cost to the Government (i.e. will offerors propose a blended ceiling rate that reflects the higher risk FFP pricing arrangement)?</p>
<p><strong>Responses:</strong> All responses to this Request for Information (RFI) shall be submitted via email to mshinney@fs.fed.us by close of business on 08 December 2017. Responses received after this date may or may not be considered during solicitation development. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> This is not a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid; it is only an avenue to obtain industry comments and concerns and is to be used for informational purposes only. The Forest Service does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request, nor will the Forest Service pay for the information requested. Industry feedback is intended to be used to assist with acquisition strategy and may be used to structure the Government's solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to the RFI. Respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information they furnish must comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's confidential treatment regulations at 17 C.F.R. 200.83. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.</p>

<p style="text-align: left; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity <span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">to license a new technology for development and/or partnership.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our goal is to frame the available technology as an <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">opportunity</span>, to participate in the final development of a commercial product that can be made available to potential users including government agencies, and first responder groups.<br /></span></span></p>
<p style="mso-outline-level: 1"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span>: </strong></p>
<p>The United States Government and many state and local agencies have spent billions of dollars fielding radiation detection equipment at borders, ports, and in cities to protect against attempts at radiological or nuclear terrorism or to prepare for the potential life-saving response needed in the aftermath, should such an attack occur. Such training is inadequate because it does not allow for the simultaneous use of their actual radiation detection gear, against scenarios of most concern. Training for scenarios that include high-hazard-level radiation sources such as Radiological Dispersal or Exposure Devices (RDD, RED, respectively), or wide-area contamination. limited because of the unwanted radiation dose, cost, safety, security (especially for special nuclear materials, SNM), as well as licensing and shipping requirements associated with their use. No current training methods provide the fully realistic experience to the user dealing with actual hazard-level RDD/RED sources or SNM in field operations with realistic radiation detection physics in the neighborhoods and borders where responders are expected to be prepared to face such possibilities. Use of small radioactive sources or virtual trainers have fundamental limitations that provide less than adequate training for responders.</p>
<p>In order to address such limitations LLNL has developed RaFTS, an externally mounted device that directly interfaces with the circuitry of operational radiation detection systems. With RaFTS, trainees' detectors respond on their own instruments to radiation levels that are dependent on their physical location relative to a pre-determined scenario. The outputs produced by RaFTS are of a quality that the detection instrument behaves as it would with real radioactivity, producing spectra on the detector that can be analyzed, andradiation intensity levels that realisticly depend on the detector's location, without the presence of any radiation sources. Detectors behave as they would in real life, even including out-of-range responses, if so enabled. The physics of the radiation detection process is absolutely maintained including time and location varying responses, statistical randomness, etc. These same phenomena are observed when measuring real radiation sources.</p>
<p>There are three main components to the RaFTS system: 1) the radiation detector, which can be of any type and from any manufacturer; 2) the RaFTS electronics, which produce the electronic pulses that are injected into the electronics of the radiation detector through a (to be) standardized port interface; and 3) the exercise scenario, which defines the synthetic radiation field and time-varying radioactivity concentrations/signal rates throughout the exercise area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The result is the detector system responds as if real sources are present and located at specific locations or are dispersed over specific areas in the training exercise. As a function of the distance between the detector and those simulated source locations, the RaFTS's signal injection rate adjusts according to realistic physics. The training area can be of any size.</p>
<p>The radiation detector can be of any type and from any manufacturer. The RaFTS system requires simple modifications to the radiation detector: a connection between the actual radiation detection component of the detector, e.g., the high-purity germanium (HPGe) crystal, the phototube, or other detector material, and the electronics of radiation detector, with a wire running to a port located on the outside of the housing surrounding the radiation detector. The RaFTS simply replaces the detector material as the input to the electronics of the radiation detector. Thus, all the output measurements (count rates, spectra, and evaluated data) of the detector function as if a real source were present.</p>
<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none">The above picture shows an Ortec HPGe detector with an early version of the RaFTS equipment attached.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The incremental weight of the RaFTS including the batteries is 1.5 lbs, while the HPGe detector weight is approximately 25 lbs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The final RaFTS system is expected to be approximately the size and weight of a large cell phone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have also demonstrated a modifying a hand-held NaI-based detector functioning with the RaFTS system. The NaI detectors are smaller and lighter than the HPGe detectors and will provide key dimensions for the planned miniaturization of the RaFTS.</p>

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source a DOT-412 Tank Trailer to Amerochem for a period of 156 days. Amerochem is the current contract provider for 93% Sulfuric Acid bulk delivery at the MCAS Cherry Point Water Treatment Plant. However, due to bulk storage tank failure MCAS Cherry Point needs an immediate alternate form of storage for the sulfuric acid. Amerochem will provide this temporary solution which meets all safety requirements for handling and storing this hazardous product. Because this is an environmental emergency and Amerochem has the contract for the delivery of the chemical, sole sourcing the rental of the temporary storage facility is in the best interest of the government.

<DESC>W31P4Q-13-D-0026. This notice is a synopsis in accordance with FAR 5.101 for a proposed contract action to Contract W31P4Q-13-D-0026 published at least 10 days before the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone Arsenal intends to award a modification to the existing Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wireless (TOW) Engineering Services (ES) contract which will extend the contract period from 1 December 2017 through 31 May 2019. The extension will provide for the continuation of ES in support of the TOW family of missiles, the M41 series of TOW Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) including the Modified ITAS, the M220 series of TOW systems and associated equipment.</p>
<p>This eighteen month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>This eighteen month extension is intended to be awarded to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) under FAR 6.302-1 as award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement.</p>
<p>This extension is necessary to allow for the other than Full and Open Competition (FAOC) acquisition of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p>The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or document related to this eighteen month extension. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to Douglas.l.bowen2.civ@mail.mil and Dorphelia.b.foster.civ@mail.mil.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>The current Solicitation 6FEC-E6-030292-B, Refresh 30, dated November 20, 2017 is hereby issued to incorporate multiple clause and regulation updates, and other administrative changes. Offers received after the current refresh date November 20, 2017, using any templates or attachments from previous refresh solicitations will be rejected.

This solicitation is open continuously with no closing date. The resultant contracts are awarded as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity; Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment. Contract periods commence on the Date of Award through a 5-year base period with three 5-year option periods. The resultant contracts provide a streamlined acquisition approach for federal agencies to obtain services related to facilities maintenance and management solutions for real property and energy management, water conservation and support services.  Agency ordering procedures for services and further information on the GSA Multiple Award Schedules program may be found at www.gsa.gov/schedules.   

As part of GSAs continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

Full Products and Broad Services Offerings
Offeror must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). 

Fair and Reasonable Pricing
To determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.   

PLEASE NOTE:  ALL RESPONSES SHALL BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY AS EOFFERS 

The following link provides guidance on utilizing the eOffer and eMod systems, obtaining digital certificates, and using the eOffer and eMod Training Guides:  http://eoffer.gsa.gov.

Offerors are responsible for payment to Open Ratings, Inc. for past performance evaluation prior to submission of an offer.  The report and completed order form must be submitted with the offer. 

GSA is only issuing this solicitation/request for proposal through the FedBizOpps internet site, GSA will not provide paper copies of this solicitation. Interested parties may access the solicitation at Internet address http://www.fbo.gov. This site contains information describing the Federal Business Opportunities and how to register to receive automatic notices of acquisitions.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by this agency.

<p>PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition.

The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (OCT 2014): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) CURRENT, UNRESTRICTED R.N. AND A.C.N.M. LICENSES = 35 POINTS. Potential contractors must submit a copy of registered nursing and American College of Nurse-Midwives licenses (all previous licenses ever held, at a minimum, license numbers and the State(s)) with price quote; (2) RESUME/CURRICULUM VITAE = 35 POINTS. Potential contractors must submit resume/CV with price quote. Resumes/CV's must include information relating to: (a) Professional Education; (b) Certifications; and (c) Previous jobs; and (3) COMPANY PAST PERFORMANCE = 30 POINTS. The Company must demonstrate its record of successful performance in past contracts and/or jobs, Government and/or commercial. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts/jobs. The offeror must include at least three references. In evaluating past performance the Government may also use information from its own files, information provided by the offeror, or from any other sources it deems appropriate. Offerors will be given the opportunity to clarify information concerning the relevancy of an offeror's past performance information, and any adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. If the offeror has no relative past performance, they shall affirmatively state so. NOTE: The Government reserves the right to contact any reference provided by the offeror in evaluating the offeror's past performance. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to use any information that comes to the attention of the Government in evaluating the offeror. (4) COST/PRICE: Price is not assigned an adjectival rating or scored. It will be evaluated to determine whether it is reasonable and if the quotation reflects an understanding of the requirement. This factor will be evaluated utilizing price analysis techniques identified in FAR Part 15.404-1. Analysis will include review of price reasonableness and balanced pricing. Offerors are cautioned that "materially unbalanced" prices and/or unreasonably high or low prices may cause your quotation to be deemed unacceptable and rejected. Technical and past performance, when combined, are considered approximately equal to cost or price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>EVALUATION APPROACH: The content of the written quotations, as well as information derived from discussions/negotiations, if discussions are held, will be evaluated to determine the degree and extent to which the requirements and objectives set forth in the solicitation are satisfied. No assumption will be made by Government evaluators regarding areas not defined in the offeror's written material/information provided to the Government for evaluation.</p>
<p>EVAULATION METHODOLOGY: A team of Government personnel will evaluate the quotations. The quotations will be evaluated in accordance with the aforementioned factors. Any quotation that is unrealistic, in terms of technical approach, schedule commitments, and or costs (high or low) will be deemed unacceptable.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: Selection of the successful offeror will be made based on the evaluation criteria. The quotations will be evaluated and a contract awarded under the Best Value Continuum approach to permit tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors. This will allow the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror who meets or exceeds the technical acceptability standards established in the factors referenced above.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.  Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.  Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.   Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.  If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).  The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.  The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.  The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.  The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.  This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico.  Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.  Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility.  Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.  RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access.  Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p><br />252.204-7004 Alternate A, System for Award Management (May 2013)</p>
<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or an OEM authorized distributor to its current location.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />52.246-2 - Inspection of Supplies -- Fixed-Price (Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work.

The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected.

Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice.

Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

level possible before considering the more formal process described below.

Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC><p>Special Notice (SN) DARPA-SN-18-05: Advanced Plant Technologies (APT) Proposers Day</p>
<p>DATE: December 12, 2017 LOCATION: Arlington, VA<br />REGISTRATION DEADLINE: December 6, 2017 or when capacity is reached, whichever comes first. We will continue to accept webinar only registrations through December 11, 2017 or until webinar capacity is reached, whichever comes first.<br /><br />REGISTRATION WEBSITE: https://events.sa-meetings.com/APTProposersDay<br /><br />TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Blake Bextine, DARPA/BTO<br />Email: DARPA-SN-18-05@darpa.mil</p>
<p>The Biological Technologies Office (BTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a Proposers Day for the potential proposer community in support of a planned Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Advanced Plant Technologies (APT) program. The Proposers Day will be held on December 12, 2017 at The Westin Arlington Gateway hotel in Arlington, VA. Advance registration is required. The event will be webcast for those who would like to participate remotely. Advance registration is required for both the physical meeting and the webcast. Note, all times listed in this announcement and on the registration website are Eastern Time.</p>
<p>The Proposers Day objectives are:</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li>To introduce the science and technology community (industry, academia, and government) to the Advanced Plant Technologies program vision and goals;<br /><br />
<p>To explain the logistics of DARPA contract awards as well as the objectives of the Advanced Plant Technologies program;</p>
<p>To facilitate interaction between investigators that may have capabilities to develop elements of interest and relevance to Advanced Plant Technologies goals; and</p>
To encourage and promote teaming arrangements among organizations that have the necessary expertise, facilities and capabilities to meet research objectives established by the Advanced Plant Technologies program.
<p>The Proposers Day will include overview presentations by government personnel, an information session to respond to questions from participants, "lightning" talks (three minutes, one PowerPoint slide) and posters for potential proposers to highlight technical capability or interest to promote teaming.</p>
<p>Attendance at this event is not a requirement for submission of a proposal or selection for funding. Information relayed during the Proposers Day will be made available on the BTO section of the DARPA Opportunities page: http://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/opportunities.<br /><br />Advanced Plant Technologies Program Overview:</p>
<p>The goal of the APT program is to control and direct plant physiology to detect chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear threats, as well as electromagnetic signals. Plant sensors developed under the program will sense specific stimuli and report these signals with a remotely recognized phenotype (e.g., modified reflectance, morphology, phenology, etc.). Modern plant biotechnology holds significant promise for addressing a range of Department of Defense (DoD) needs; plants are easily deployed, self-powering, and ubiquitous in the environment, and the combination of these native abilities with specifically engineered sense-and-report traits will produce sensors occupying new and unique operational spaces. The long-term success of engineered plant sensors requires the ability to ensure plant survivability for months or years in a natural environment subject to stresses not present in a laboratory environment. Meeting both the sensor and survivability technical goals of the APT program will require a combination of plant genomics emerging technologies, precision gene editing tools, and novel methods for engineering new sensing capabilities and physiological responses. Proposing teams should include experts in diverse fields including plant physiology, gene editing, biochemistry, modelling, phenotyping, remote sensing, and plant ecology.</p>
<p>Proposers to APT are expected to advance plant synthetic biology for the purpose of bioengineering plant varieties for sensor use. DARPA strongly encourages teaming to ensure the expertise and capabilities necessary to meet program goals. Each established team is free to suggest their own potential stimulus-response pairs and applications. Proposing teams should include at least one team member with expertise in the proposed operational environment for the stimulus response capability.</p>
<p>Interested attendees are invited to present a brief one-slide PowerPoint summary of their interests and capabilities (see Attachment 1). These will be presented during 3-minute "lightning" presentations at Proposers Day. Presentations consisting of multiple slides will not be granted a time slot. Attendees may also choose to present a poster (see Attachment 2) describing their research interests that will be available for viewing and interaction for the duration of Proposers Day - those interested may submit both a lightning talk and a poster.<br /><br />Lightning talk and/or poster submissions will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis until time constraints (lightning talks) or physical capacity (posters) is reached. Lightning talk submissions are restricted to those attending the physical meeting. Interested parties are also invited to submit a one-page profile describing technical competencies and facility capabilities as it relates to the program and desired technical competencies in other potential teammates (Attachment 3).</p>
<p>All profiles, presentations, and posters must be emailed to DARPA-SN-18-05@darpa.mil no later than 12:00 PM EDT on December 7, 2017. Following the deadline, a consolidated list of all profiles (not presentations or posters) will be sent via email to the proposers who submitted a valid profile (following the format provided and not exceeding the single page limit).<br /><br />Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants. Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the information and organizations contained in the consolidated teaming profile document, nor does DARPA or DoD exercise any responsibility for improper dissemination of the teaming profiles.</p>
<p>Registration Information:</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: Registration for physical participation will close on December 6, 2017 at 12:00 PM EST or when capacity is reached and webinar participation will close on December 11, 2017 at 12:00 PM EST or when webinar capacity is reached.</p>
<p>Registration is limited by the venue capacity, and early registration is strongly recommended.&nbsp; There will be no on-site registration.</p>
<p>Participants must register in advance through the registration website. There will an optional $54 meal fee for the Proposers Day. Early registration is strongly recommended. Due to space limitations, attendance for the Proposers Day will be limited to the first 125 registrants. Remote participation via webcast is limited to 500 participants. Interested parties are encouraged to coordinate attendance internally within their organizations prior to registration. Physical attendance is limited to no more than two representatives per division/department. Individuals who are unable to register because the deadline has occurred or capacity has been reached, will be added to a waitlist. If slots remain open after registration closes or become available due to cancellations, the slots will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis from the waitlist.</p>
<p>An online registration form and various other meeting details can be found at the registration website, <br /><br />https://events.sa-meetings.com/APTProposersDay.</p>
<p>All attendees are required to present government-issued photo identification upon entry to the event.</p>
<p>Further administrative questions should be addressed to DARPA-SN-18-05@darpa.mil. Please refer to the Advanced Plant Technologies Proposers Day (DARPA-SN-18-05) in all correspondence. This announcement is not a request for proposals; any sent will be disregarded.</p>
<p>This SN is issued solely for information and potential new program planning purposes. The SN does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Submission is voluntary and is not required to propose to subsequent Broad Agency Announcements (if any) or research solicitations (if any) on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred in responding to this SN. Respondents are advised that DARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this SN. NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE SN RESPONSE.</p>

11/16/2017: The Interested Parties List has been updated for an additional 349 entries bringing the total lines to 982.

11/09/2017: The Interested Parties List has been updated for an additional 283 entries bringing the total lines to 633.

11/08/2017: The purpose of this revision is to provide Amendment #1 to SIR No. DTFAWA-18-R-00001. Redline and clean versions are attached. Changes to the SIR consist of including specific dates in paragraph 7 Milestone Schedules (Table 1) and clarifying information in paragraphs 9.3.4 and 9.3.5.

11/07/2017: The purpose of this revision is to make publicly available the first iteration (V1) of the UASIPP Interested Parties List. The list has been added as an attachment.

11/02/2017: On October 25, 2017 the President directed the establishment of the Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Pilot Program (UASIPP) to test further integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) in a select number of State, local, and tribal jurisdictions (this includes U.S. Territories and holdings).

This new pilot program encourages State, local, and tribal governments, in partnership with UAS operators and other private sector stakeholders, to conduct advanced operations safely and with public support in affected communities.  The Department Of Transportation (DOT), through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), is announcing in a Federal Register Notice establishment of the UAS Integration Pilot Program, and identifies this site (https://faaco.faa.gov) to obtain the specific instructions for requesting access to a designated portal for submitting an application (in form of a proposal) to be considered for participation in the program. 

The first formal step for considering participants is the issuance of a Screening Information Request (SIR). The SIR, referred to in other Government agencies as a Request For Proposal, or RFP, is the vehicle through which the FAA will request prospective applicants to submit specific information for evaluation.  Applicants must be State, local or tribal Governments to be considered for award. Government applicants may team with industry.
The specific instructions for requesting access to the application portal are contained in the attached SIR. Applicants are required to provide their Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number with their request for portal access. This SIR (and any future changes) will be available on the FAA Contract Opportunities Web Site (https://faaco.faa.gov).  Additional information about the SIR process including the time critical schedule (SIR Table 1) should be reviewed immediately. The schedule within the SIR will be updated with hard dates when the Federal Register Notice (FRN) is formally published. The FRN publish date is expected to be on or about November 8, 2017.

The FAAs common acquisition process for obtaining information, evaluating, and selecting Applicants is contained in the agencys Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The FAA will use the AMS as guidance in the SIR process for obtaining and evaluating information.  The ultimate selection for the UASIPP Lead Participants will be at the discretion, and order, of the Secretary of Transportation.

Applicants who have been selected by the Secretary will enter, under Other Transaction Authority, into Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) with the FAA.  Each MOA will set out the terms and conditions under which the respective participant conducts the pilot program. A sample MOA is provided as an attachment.

The FAA anticipates awards of five or more MOAs resulting from this Screening Information Request (SIR). The period of performance is anticipated to be for three (3) years.
The Government will not provide any funding for project performance.
Each applicant must submit a proposal in accordance with the instructions contained in the attached SIR. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the SIR.
To be considered for award, applicants must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) and not listed on the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).  Prospective applicants are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this solicitation will be published at http://faaco.faa.gov under the current announcements for the FAA Headquarters.   It is the prospective applicants' responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement.  
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the SIR, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement. Therefore any cost associated with responding to this announcement is solely at the respondents expense.

<DESC>VIRTUAL SITE VISIT:
<p>Please join us to discuss upcoming USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station (NRS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), contract solicitations for the FY 2018 and our change in contracting model to a new 5 year Blank Purchase Agreement (BPA). We are planning multiple awards for FIA contract work in the next fiscal year and the change in contract type will affect many of the contract specifications and procedures that have been traditionally in previous FIA contract solicitations. Colleen Reittinger, NRS Acquisition Management Group Leader and a Contracting Officer, will describe the new BPA contracting model and the difference from our previous contracting model and I will discuss the upcoming FIA work.</p>
<p>We are planning two calls to help with availability and participation from current and prospective future FIA contractors. Both conference calls will try to cover the same materials so attend one should suffice.</p>
<p><br />The first call will be:</p>
<p>Wednesday, November 29, 2017<br />11AM eastern/10AM central/9AM mountain/8AM Pacific</p>
<p>The second call will be the following week:</p>
<p>Wednesday, December 6, 2017<br />11AM eastern/10AM central/9AM mountain/8AM Pacific</p>
<p>Conference call line for both calls: <br />888-844-9904 Passcode - 5952212#</p>
<p>Thanks and I hope you can join one of the calls. If neither call fits your schedule, please let me know if you are interested in learning more about FIA contracts and can't make one of these calls</p>

<DESC>Request for Proposals #140P8318R0001 is to replace windows, skylights, and exterior doors at the North Cascade Visitor Center.  This building was built in 1991 and is 11,930 square feet. The glass elements to be replaced are original. The building will be closed to the public during construction although NPS employees may work on-site intermittently. Additional details will be provided in the Statement of Work and drawings posted with the Request for Proposals, which will be posted at www.FBO.gov on approximately October 23, 2017.
PROJECT LOCATION: The North Cascades Visitor Center is located in Newhalem, WA, approximately 65 miles east of Sedro-Woolley WA within Ross Lake National Recreation Area. Maps and information are posted at www.nps.gov/NOCA.
SITE VISIT: A group site visit will be held at 11:00 am on November 1, 2017; details in Section L of the solicitation. Attendance at the site visit is strongly encouraged (not mandatory). Requests for individual hosted site visits will not be honored; however, contractors may view the building's exterior and site individually any time. The visitor center is open to the public October 7, 8, 14, 15, 21, 22, and 28, 2017, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, and then closes until early May, 2018. 
TARGET WORK DATES: The period of performance will be 60 days after commencing on-site work and substantial completion must occur by May 4, 2018. The Notice to Proceed will likely be issued in January and the Contractor may select their on-site starting date. We anticipate that the work will occur in March and April, 2018, due to winter weather conditions at the site.

The NAICS code for this project is 238150, Glass and Glazing Contractors, and the small business size standard is $15 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years. All work will be performed under a single firm-fixed-price construction contract subject to the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction), formerly known as the Davis-Bacon Act. In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $150,000 and $250,000.
The entire solicitation package, including drawings and specifications, will be in Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF. Offerors will submit their proposals in digital format per instructions included in the solicitation.  The RFP will require offerors to submit both a technical and a price proposal; the government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price and award to the firm whose offer represents the best value.  All eligible responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the National Park Service, however offerors who have not established and/or maintained an active registration at www.SAM.gov prior to the offer due date and time will be considered either ineligible or non-responsive and will not be considered for award.  A bid (offer) guarantee (20%), payment bond (100%), performance bond (100%), and liability insurance will be required prior to contract performance.
Vendors can search for opportunities and award history on www.fbo.gov without registering.

<DESC>Amendment to update Industry Day information 

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando will be hosting Industry Days on November 28, 2017 and November 30, 2017.  The topic will be Sailor 2025 (S2025) / Ready Relevant Learning (RRL).
 
The RRL project is a transformational Navy training initiative that will accelerate the learning of every Sailor for faster response to our rapidly changing warfighting requirements, and achieve higher performance by coupling the timing of training delivery with every Sailors actual deck plate need.  RRL creates a learning continuum across a Sailors career that will ensure every Sailor has the latest training to support assigned task.
 RRL will modernize delivery methods from traditional brick-and-mortar schoolhouses to mobile, multi-media, multi-platform delivery solutions that leverage the best concepts to accelerate learning as individuals, teams and organizations. Finally, RRL will allow rapid infusion of relevant course content to accelerate the dissemination of critical warfighting knowledge to Sailors.

<DESC>Amended Notice:

Due to low response and interest for an open forum industry day for Portal Cranes, Navy Crane Center has decided to change the forum from an in-person open forum to teleconferences with individual companies.  The industry day dates will remain the same (12/5 and 12/6).  Companies previously registered for the in-person forum will be added to the teleconference schedule, unless you express your desire to not participate in a teleconference with Navy Crane Center.  Those not previously registered that have an interest in an industry day teleconference can be added to the schedule by providing the requested information from the original notice.  This information must be forwarded to lisa.sumpter@navy.mil no later than Monday, November 27, 2017.
  

The Government will provide registrants with the following information by Tuesday, November 28, 2017:  1) teleconference schedule (meetings will be scheduled in 2-hour blocks); 2) teleconference call-in number and password; and 3) meeting agenda.

*In order for this meeting to be productive and meaningful, companies are encouraged to have technical staff (e.g., engineer, designer, etc.) participate in the meeting.

*All other intent and content of the original notice applies unless changed via this amendment.

Please also include in past performance information the contract numbers, dollar value, and period of performance for each contract referenced in the response to this sources sought.

11.	The Government is still determining the acquisition strategy and if this acquisition will be a small business set-aside, then FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, applies.
 Note that if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small businesses, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR clause 52.219-14.

If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, and if subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of the effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large business subcontractors will be used.

<DESC><p><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) SUMMARY</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENT: Telecommunications Transition and Management Support</strong></p>
<p><strong>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Labor, Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) requires expert transition and management support to enable the department and its sub-agencies and offices to successfully transition telecommunications services off of expiring contracts and onto new contracts, which will be issued under four master task orders. Under this proposed contract, the Contractor shall provide management services for the OCIO Transition Program Office which will be overseeing task orders awarded by DOL on the GSA EIS contract. These management services will aid the OCIO Transition Program Office in transitioning, obtaining, and maintaining proper contract administration and management controls of the task orders issued under the master GSA contract.</p>
<p>This effort is a new effort. There is no incumbent. This&nbsp;requirment is total small business set aside.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> <br />Prior telecommunications acquisitions have traditionally followed a similar path or acquisition of services, utilizing broad scoped GWAC's such as FTS2000, FTS2001, Networx, WITS and other GSA vehicles. The next iteration of these GSA contracts will be a large multiple award IDIQ contract; Enterprise Infrastructure Services (EIS). DOL currently uses these expiring GSA contracts for a large portion of the Department-wide telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for the Telecommunications Transition and Management Support. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government for forming a binding contract.</p>
<p>This RFI is a request for interested parties to describe their technical capabilities and demonstrated experience with services and support necessary to plan and execute the transition of services from OCIO's expiring local and long distance contracts to new contracts. The expiring contracts include but are not limited to Networx Universal, Networx Enterprise, WITS3, GSA Regional Services, other GSA Local Services Arrangements and other contracts that are currently acquired under agency specific contracts.</p>
<p>All interested contractors are requested to provide written response to the questions and potential task areas provided below. All small businesses to include Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, and Women-Owned and service Disabled are strongly encouraged to provide timely response to this Request for Information (RFI). A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist DOL in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to provide the required services. In addition, this information will also be used to assist DOL in establishing a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract/small business participation plan and/or small business goal percentages.</p>

<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>122217
<CONTACT>Timothy Whitaker, Email timothy.a.whitaker@usdoj.gov
<DESC>The Department of Justice is seeking attorneys to litigate debt collection cases for various Federal agencies. Using negotiated procedures authorized in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15, the Department of Justice (DOJ) contemplates award of up to three (3) contracts with private practitioners of law for debt collection services on behalf of the United States in the counties that comprise the Federal Judicial District for the Eastern District of New York. The DOJ launched the Private Counsel Program following the passage of the Federal Debt Recovery Act of 1986 which first authorized the use of private law firms for this purpose. The Debt Collection Management Staff manages the program with legal oversight by the United States Attorney's Offices at the district level. The program is currently running in 19 districts nationwide, with further expansion planned. This procurement is strictly limited to attorneys who are licensed to practice law in the Eastern District of New York. Contractors will be required to pursue debt collection activities which parallel existing industry procedures that have proven to be effective and efficient; to interact with government representatives at defined stages of the collection process (i.e., settlement, compromise, etc.); and to input relevant case data in a computer database maintained by the Government. Contract payments will be based primarily on contingency fee payments for unsecured debt collection and firm-fixed prices for secured debt collection. The anticipated period of performance for each contract will be a base year with up to four option years. The solicitation will be available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fbo.gov, and is anticipated to be released on or about November 20, 2017. Amendments to the solicitation, if any, issued prior to the receipt of proposals will also be posted on www.fbo.gov. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site for access to the solicitation. All responsible sources meeting the eligibility requirements may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. It is highly recommended that, prior to submitting a proposal, interested parties obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and register in the System for Award Management (SAM), www.sam.gov, as these requirements are mandatory for any firm selected for a contract award.

<DESC>Amendment 1 - Replace Attachment "Draft HPC Lease Benchmark/Scorecard Template" with corrected version "Draft HPC Lease Benchmark/Scorecard Template Revised"

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) of the Department of the Interior (DOI) intends to solicit information from multiple sources through a Request for Information (RFI).  The RFI is not a solicitation for a contract or grant award and is for informational purposes only.
Through the RFI, the Government intends to seek information from companies about a potential future High Performance Computing (HPC) system activity.  The Government intends to request information on current industry capabilities and performance on several areas of scope relating to the system hardware and software as well as training and support services, which is being considered for a future contract. Areas of scope may include HPC System Development, Technical Support for the developed system, Training and other materials. The government will also be soliciting feedback on Burst Buffer, Compute partition, and Storage System upgrade options. 
Furthermore, in the RFI, the government intends to seek feedback regarding the acquisition approach for a potential HPC system contract, and solicit alternative approaches that may reduce cost and risk.

The T3 transformer needs a complete refurbishment that will include the following:</p>
<p>The work includes but is not limited to installing retrofitted seismic anchors per detailed Government design, provision of transformer fall protection, performance of pre-refurbishment tests, draining and storing transformer oil, performance of internal inspections, refurbishment of the transformer, servicing the de-energized tap changer, provision of new equipment, weld leak repairs, reclaiming transformer oil using Regenerative Clay, provision of oxidation inhibitor for transformer oil, refilling transformer, performance of post-refurbishment tests, commissioning, and painting.</p>
