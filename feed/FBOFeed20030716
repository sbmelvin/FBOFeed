<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award Task Orders with one or more contractors to meet specific objectives of the study entitled Continuation of Arctic Nearshore Impact Monitoring In Development Area” (cANIMIDA).  The MMS encourages teaming of contractors for this procurement, but does not require that an Offeror bid on all Task Orders.  The study “Continuation of Arctic Nearshore Impact Monitoring in Development Area” (cANIMIDA) will continue monitoring impacts associated with production of oil from the Northstar Unit and any other development activities in the nearshore portion of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Beaufort Sea.  The cANIMIDA will 1) provide a basis of continuity and consistency in evaluation of potential impacts and 2) have the flexibility to incorporate new monitoring issues for any upcoming development and production in this study area.  ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT: The government estimates a period of performance for this contract will be 2003-2008 and a cost range up to $3,500,000 covering all Tasks. Ranges for each individual tasks over the period of performance are as follows:  Task 1 $1M-$1.2M; Task 2 $450,000-$500,000; Task 3 $250,000-$300,000; Task 4 $180,000-$210,000; Task 5 $450,000-$500,000; Task 6 $400,000-$450,000 and Task 7 $120,000-$150,000. A Core Contractor (Task 1) will be awarded in fiscal year (FY) 2003 and the science Tasks in FY 2004, prior to the summer 2004 field season.  BACKGROUND: In response to interagency reviews of related EIS’s and development and production plans for Northstar and Liberty Units, MMS initiated the ANIMIDA Phase I and ANIMIDA Phase II Programs as a long-term monitoring of potential impacts of Northstar and Liberty.   Northstar proceeded to development and is now producing.  No decision has yet been made to develop Liberty.  ANIMIDA Phase II of the program is built on the Phase I results (OCS Study MMS 2001-104) and will be producing final reports in early FY 2004.  Interim 2002 and (draft) 2003 reports covering Phase II are available on a CD-ROM for the ANIMIDA science task orders (TO’s) through the Contracting Officer (CO).  The ANIMIDA Phase II science TO’s are:  Hydrocarbon and Metal Characterization of Sediments, Bivalves and Amphipods in the ANIMIDA Study Area; Annual Assessment of Subsistence Whaling Near Cross Island; Sources, Concentrations, and Dispersion Pathways for Suspended Sediment in Areas in Oil and Gas Development along the Coastal Beaufort Sea; Monitoring the Boulder Patch as Part of the Arctic Nearshore Impact Monitoring in the Development Area (ANIMIDA) Program; Partitioning of Potential Contaminants between Dissolved and Particulate Phases in Waters of the Coastal Beaufort Sea; and Baseline Characterization of Anthropogenic Contaminants in Biota Associated with the Alaska OCS Liberty and Northstar Oil and Gas Production Unites in the Nearshore Beaufort Sea.
SCOPE OF WORK: Proposed cANIMIDA task orders follow.  Procurement of all of these tasks or task objectives will be dependent the availability of funds.  TASK ORDER 001: "The continuation of Arctic Nearshore Impact Monitoring in the Development Area (cANIMIDA) Program – Core Contractor Program Management, Logistics, Database, and Reporting.” provides overall project coordination and management role reporting to MMS Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR); field logistics including captain for MMS Launch 1273; develops cANIMIDA database design and analysis tools, imports forms and metadata source file and integrates with the MMS CORIS database; prepares annual cANIMIDA Synthesis Report for the overall cANIMIDA program, draft Final and revised Final Synthesis Report and Technical Summary; and submits summary paper to a peer-reviewed journal. 	Task Order 002: "Hydrocarbon and Metal Characterization of Sediments in the cANIMIDA Study Area" 	in summer 2004, repeats the field monitoring of sediment chemistry program conducted in 1999, 2000, and 2002 for ANIMIDA, focusing on potential impacts from the Northstar and potential Liberty development and Bivalve and amphipod samples will be collected at sediment stations for cANIMIDA Task Order 5. 	In 2005, 2006, and 2007, similar effort will be extended in similar or alternative summer sampling efforts, depending on level and location of development activities. 	Perform organic and inorganic chemical analyses, verify their consistency with previous measurements and thereby their capability of determining any observed incremental impacts.  	Task Order 003: "Sources, Concentrations, and Dispersion Pathways for Suspended Sediment in the cANIMIDA Study Area” further delineates and quantifies the offshore dispersion of river runoff and suspended sediments during the spring melt; traces the dispersion of suspended sediments into deeper, outer shelf water; continues to refine sourcing and marker techniques for suspended sediments in the cANIMIDA Study Area; expands the chemical analyses of suspended sediments to include hydrocarbon composition; and investigates the contribution of shoreline erosion to suspended sediment load and composition.  	Task Order 004: "Partitioning of Potential Contaminants between Dissolved and Particulate Phases in the cANIMIDA Study Area”  	continues to delineate trace element distribution by water mass type from rivers to offshore, full salinity water; determines the reactions/mixing during freshwater/seawater mixing; and better defines the adsorption/desorption of petroleum hydrocarbons and selected metals under ice, in water with low total suspended solids (TSS), and in the well-stratified waters after spring melt.  	Task Order 005: "Integrated Biomonitoring and Bioaccumulation of Contaminants in the cANIMIDA Study Area” refines conceptual model of contaminant uptake, bioaccumulation, and trophic interaction in cANIMIDA biota; examine the uptake of dissolved contaminants into the food chain; and measures bioaccumulation in selected species, determining petroleum hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals, CYP1A induction (P-450), and bile fluorescing aromatic compounds, where appropriate; coordinate amphipod and bivalve sampling and analyses with Task Order 2 sediment program; and continues ANIMIDA deployments and analyses of SPMDs and caged bivalves.  	Task Order 006: "Monitoring the “Boulder Patch”, as part of the cANIMIDA Program, measures kelp production and biomass; continues monitoring spatial and vertical distribution of measures of total suspended solids; and monitors diversity of the benthic community in the Boulder Patch. 	Task Order 007: "Continuation of Annual Assessment of Subsistence Bowhead Whaling Near Cross Island as Part of the cANIMIDA Program." continues the Annual Assessment of Subsistence Bowhead Whaling Near Cross Island started by ANIMIDA Task Order 4.  	Following the last field season, compare and summarize significant results from the 2001-2007 annual ANIMIDA/cANIMIDA reports on Cross Island Whaling.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to award a sole-source contract to the National Center for Atmospheric Research who currently supports NASA/GSFC in providing data product services for the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposhere (MOPITT) Instrument.  The current contract with NCAR started April 10, 1990 and will end in December 2003. The purpose of this procurement is to ensure that the processing and reprocessing of the data from the MOPITT instrument and delivery of standard data products to the user community continues through three years beyond the expected life of the instrument.  The instrument, Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), is one of five instruments on the Terra satellite, one of several spacecraft that are part of NASA Earth Science Enterprise's Earth Observing System (EOS) Program.  Terra was launched in December 1999 and has been collecting data from all of its instruments and transmitting them to the ground station in White Sands, NM.	The data are being routinely processed at the EOS Data and Operations System to remove telemetry artifacts, and higher-level scientific data products The expected lifetime of Terra, launched in December 1999, is (six) 6 years and the data will need to be reprocessed for about three years beyond that period to ensure a consistent time-series of products at the end of the mission.  Thus, it is necessary to support generation of standard products through December 2008.	The MOPITT Principal Investigator (PI)	has been processing the instrument data into Level 1 and higher-level products since Terra was launched and the instrument was first turned on.  This work is currently performed under Contract NAS5-30888 that ends in December 2003. NASA/GSFC intends to continue support services with NCAR based upon 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source as implemented by  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  Only NCAR is intimately familiar with MOPITT Science Investigator-Led Processing System (SIPS) processing and reprocessing data continuation currently being performed under NAS5-30888.  Prospective replacement of the incumbent at this time introduces duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirements already established.  In addition, NCAR possesses unique knowledge and expertise not possessed by other vendors at this time including detailed understanding of data continuation for the MOPITT Instrument Program.  However, companies that believe they can provide these services for this period without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported under NAS5-30888 should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis on the NAIS or Commerce Business Daily.  These capability statements will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to award this contract on a competitive basis.  Responses to the synopsis received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension on a full and open basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  See Note 22.  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:   http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nnotes.htm   .

<DESC>NA This award will be sole source to ILC Manufactured Products Division for a quantity of 22,292, M40A1 (Field Mask) (S, M, L), NSN: 4240-01-370-3821, 3822 and 3823, Part Number: 5-1-2740-10, -20 and -30.  This notice is for subcontracting purposes only.  The  M40A1 CB Masks protect face, eyes, and lungs from field concentrations of chemical-biological agents, toxins, and radioactive fallout particles.  A mask consists of a silicone rubber facepiece with a filter canister.  The facepeice is equipped with front and side voicemitters, drink tube, and eye lenses.  Clear and neutral gray outserts protect the eye lenses and reduce glare and lens fogging.  A hood, not permanently attached to the facepiece, provides protection of the head and neck.  A canvas carrier is  provided with each mask for storing and carrying the mask and its accessories.  A waterproof bag is provided for temporary storage of the facepiece when required by climate and mission.  A faceform holds the facepiece in proper shape when stored longer th an 30 days.  The mask is issued in three sizes: small, medium, and large.  In addition to the preceding, the M42A2 facepiece is connected to a filter canister (with carrier) or directly to the vehicle collective protection equipment by a corrugated hose. A microphone and cable mounted to the facepiece allows interface with the vehicle communication system.  The silicone rubber facepiece fits closely against the face to form a seal. Air enters the canister and passes through an air deflector into the eye ar ea of the facepiece.  The canister (screwed on to either the left or right side of the facepiece) filters out the CB agents, toxins, and radioactive particles.  From the eye area, air enters a nosecup and is inhaled through the nosecup valves.  Exhaled air  passes through the nosecup area and is expelled through an outlet valve.  Outserts are fitted with a rubber ring, which hold them securely to the facepiece eye lenses.  Optical inserts, available by medical prescription, are required for personnel who mus t wear glasses.  The mask does not protect the wearer from ammonia or carbon monoxide.  It is not effective where the amount of oxygen in the air is too low to support life.

Spectra-Physics  Corion Filters Company, of Franklin, MA shall manufacture and provide the Government with Filters, Anti-Reflective Window for the ASOS  Ceilometer.

The receiver optics is designed to focus the incoming light onto a silicon avalanche photodiode. Because only the wavelength of the transmitted pulse (904 nanometers (nm)) is needed, a filter built into the receiver circuit blocks out the majority of the extraneous signals.  The photodiode converts the light signals into a small electrical current. The preamplifier in the receiver circuit converts this current into a larger voltage signal and is sampled by the A/D converter to produce a digital value. This digital value is then stored in the sample accumulator, processed and reported to the data collection package (DCP).

 For the Anti-Reflective Window Filter with the specific Corion P/N: 53-1931 on the VAISALA model CT12K that protects the Transmitter and Receiver boards from the element and filters potentially damaging light while allowing the CT12K to send and receive the transmitted pulse (904 nanometers (nm)).  The window is optically pure white glass with an anti-reflective coating designed to proprietary specifications for frequency absorption, reflection and pass through.  16mmx14mmx1.55mm. The Government shall procure 150 Anti-Reflective Window Filter. NWS performs repair of the VAISALA model CT12K at the NWS National Reconditioning  Center in Kansas City, MO.

Vendors who believe that they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating they can meet the Governments requirements.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement tot competition based upon response tot his notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative responses must be received no later than 5 calendar days after the posting of this notice.

Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding
hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.


REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems
necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

2. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

3. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically
destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

A—MULTIPLE AWARD, INDEFINITE DELIVERY, 
INDEFINITE QUANTITY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT SUBCONTRACT FOR GENERATION OF HUMAN AND MOUSE CLONES MISSING FROM THE MGC COLLECTION OR FULL-INSERT CDNA SEQUENCING


The NCIFCRF will be soliciting proposals for a multiple-award, 5 year contract. The RFP is expected to be issued on or about 08/11/03. The National Institutes of Health has established the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) program to obtain one representative full-open reading frame (ORF) clone and its complete sequence for every human and mouse gene.  The MGC recently has also established partnerships with the rat, zebrafish and Xenopus communities to generate full ORF clone collections for those organisms.  The MGC program is a multi-Institute effort that is building a publicly accessible resource of sequences and clones, along with associated informatics tools.  This effort has already generated more than 1.4 million clones, of which approximately 50,000 have been fully sequenced, and nearly 20,000 human and mouse genes are currently represented in the collection.  (For the most current numbers, see http://mgc.nci.nih.gov).  This clone collection is used by scientists worldwide to enable biomedical research.  

The project has used an EST based strategy to identify putative full ORF clones. This approach has been quite productive, but there are many genes for which full ORF clones have not been identified yet.  While the MGC will continue to use this strategy, it is anticipated that the most cost-effective approach to completing this collection will be one that is targeted to these missing genes.  The MGC is open to different cost effective and efficient strategies to achieve this goal, including, for example, PCR cloning directly from RNA or cDNA library sources or clone synthesis.  The acquisition of pre-existing sets of full-ORF clones to be incorporated into the MGC clone collection could also contribute to meeting the project’s goals.  

At the same time, the existing random EST strategy will continue to be employed for the rat, zebrafish and Xenopus gene collection projects since this approach is effective for the scale of the projects being undertaken.  To accomplish all of these goals, the MGC will also need to support high quality full-insert cDNA sequencing activities.  Organizations interested in participating in the either the generation of human and mouse clones missing from the MGC collection or full-insert cDNA sequencing are requested to send or e-mail letters of interest to the address contained herein. Multiple multi-year awards are anticipated.

The production of supplies listed may require a substantial investment.  Place of performance will be the awardees locations.

<DESC>This project includes the maintenance dredging of the access channel to the BT-11 boat harbor as well as the boat harbor itself.  This area was previously dredged in the late 1980's.  This project shall restore the area to the dimensions achieved during the previous dredging.  Dredging to the original dimensions is expected to produce approximately 25,000 cubic yards of spoil material. All dredging shall be done by the Contractor between the dates of September 1, 2003 and April 30, 2004 to avoid times when sea turtle densities in in-shore waters are relatively high. Prior to start of dredging, the Contractor shall survey layout and construct a 130' wide by 2,000' long containment/settling basin surrounded by a 7.2' high earthen berm with a splashboard riser type bleed-off system on the runway target area.  The bottom of dike elevation shall be 5'6" and the top of dike elevation shall be 12'8".  The containment/settling basin is to be constructed in preparation for receiving the wet dredged spoils.  Pipes shall then be temporarily installed along existing BT-11 roads and the dredged spoils pumped to the simulated runway target for disposal.  Spoils shall remain in the basin until they have dewatered, then the Contractor shall return with suitable heavy equipment and spread the dried spoil materials on the low areas and potholes in the runway target area, as directed by the Government. BT-11 is an island, and logistics & costs associated with transport of all necessary equipment, personnel, and materials shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. All necessary Federal and State permits will be obtained and associated fees paid by the Contractor.  Contractor shall obtain Erosion and Sediment Control Permit and a Corps of Engineers Dredging Permit.  The Dredging Permit shall be applied for prior to the start of any other construction activities.  This will require the Contractor to obtain current soundings in the area to be dredged and submit that data to the Corps of Engineers for approval.  Another set of soundings shall be taken immediately before starting dredging operations and a third set of soundings shall be submitted for quantity computations upon completion of dredging activities.

<DESC>This synopsis is being issued for Informational Purposes Only.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, N.J. intends to procure fifty-six (56) each, with an option quantity of twenty-five (25) each, AN/AWM-102, Part Number 3638AS100-1, NSN 6RD-4920-01-9026, Firing Circuit Test Sets.  These will be procured from Raytheon Technical Services Company, 6125 E. 21st Street, Indianapolis, IN  46219-2058.  These Test Sets are in support and in conjunction with multiple aircraft of the Italian, Royal Thai and Spanish Navy FMS Programs and the Spanish, Malaysian, Finnish, Swiss and Kuwait Air Force FMS Programs as well as domestic programs.  This Test Set is used to test the firing circuits of various aircraft weapon release and Cartridge Activated (CAD) systems.  It will also check the firing voltage and current for sufficient values to cause the charge to explode and eject the weapon/seat from the aircraft.  The test set will also check for stray voltages that could cause premature firing of the ejection cartridges.  Raytheon Technical Services Company is the only source that has completed the extensive qualification phases necessary for any manufacturer prior to commencing production.  They are the only manufacturer of the AWM-102 and are currently under contract with the Navy for these units.  Drawings are not available in order to issue a competitive solicitation, therefore, Raytheon is the only source available at this time to furnish these Test Sets. A manufacturer other than Raytheon would also require extensive first article/pre-production testing. 

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses received to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received as a result of this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for information received.  All responses should be directed to Mrs. Joyce Discenza.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), (DHHS) through the Program Support Center has a twelve  (12) month simplified acqusition procurement described as follows: 

CMHS objectives are to provide technical assistance and consultation requested by local providers and other federal and state agencies, especially, but not only the ORR grantees providing preventive mental health and other related human services; to develop training programs and educational modules on refugee mental health and social adjustment issues; and to maintain collection of resources on refugee mental health issues, programs and expertise.

This CMHS/ORR Entertainment Industry Roundtables with a focus on “Trafficking in Persons,” is a pilot program and includes several components.  Specifically, it is a public awareness campaign focusing on media portrayal of “Trafficking in Persons” and provides presentations to students in Departments of Communications/Film at Colleges and Universities to continue the educational process.  CMHS/ORR is looking to societal influences through educational messages.  This pilot program  will raise awareness with public and non-governmental organizations, and will broaden the scope of outreach through mass media venues in an effort to access and educate the general public.  

Trafficking in Persons, also known as “human trafficking,” is a contemporary manifestation of slavery.  Around the world, as many as 700,000 people each year, primarily women and children, are being trafficked for the purpose of forced commercial sex or slavery.  This illicit practice has not eluded the United States, where thousands of foreigners - legal and illegal - struggle behind closed doors against their will as prostitutes, factory workers, domestic servants, and migrant agricultural laborers.  Congress found that thousands of women and children each year are trafficked into the United States for such purposes.

All firms interested in being considered for this potential acquisition shall submit a written request for a copy of the solicitation to the above address by 3:00 PM  EST July 31, 2003.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), (DHHS) through the Program Support Center has a twelve  (12) month simplified acqusition procurement described as follows: 


The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) was created in 1992 to work in partnership with States to improve prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals with mental illness and substance abuse disorders. SAMHSA’s Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) provides national leadership for mental health service delivery improvements.  One of SAMHSA’s stated priorities is addressing issues of seclusion and restraint of persons with mental illnesses. 

During the past five years, concerns with deaths and injuries resulting from seclusion and restraint have received considerable attention.  In response, SAMHSA has developed a National Action Plan that was launched on May 5, 2003.  Key domains and activities within this plan focus on the identification and collection of effective reduction practices and guidelines from various sources as well as the development of standards as per the Children’s Health Act of 2000.

To date, there has been various state, Federal, facility, accreditation entity, advocate and provider policies, legislation, and data collection systems related to seclusion and restraint.  These, however, have not been compiled or analyzed to assist States, providers, consumers, and others to implement effective strategies to prevent and reduce the use of such practices.

This project aims to address this need by obtaining baseline information for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) on how States, other jurisdictions, and accreditation, professional trade and academic organizations are addressing the prevention and use of seclusion and restraint for individuals with a substance use and/or mental disorder across the lifespan within institution and community-based facilities.  This information will help develop a national-based compendium of seclusion and restraint guidelines directed to the prevention of and reduction in use of these practices.

Additionally, SAMHSA is working to develop standards on the use of seclusion and restraint as required within Part I of the Children’s Health Act of 2000.  In so doing, SAMHSA is publishing a Notice of Intent to gather public feedback on various aspects of these standards.  This project aims to analyze the public input on a SAMHSA Notice of Intent (NOI) to be published within the Federal Register, expected to occur by Summer 2003, to help formulate future regulation development of the Child Health Act (CHA) of 2000 Part I regarding non-medical community-based residential facilities for children and youth.  

In addition to supporting a key SAMHSA program priority, this effort supports the Department of Health and Human Services’s Program Objectives to “improve health outcomes” in order to “reduce the incidence and consequences of injuries and violence” and to “improve the well-being and safety of families and individuals, especially vulnerable populations.”  

The time is right for SAMHSA to identify and compile seclusion and restraint practices and guidelines and analyze public feedback to assist with required standard setting.  

	The purpose  is to 

identify and compile government, facility, advocate, accreditation entity, academic and provider policies, practices, legislation and guidelines related to seclusion and restraint for individuals with a substance use and/or mental disorder across the lifespan within institution and community-based facilities.  This information will help develop a national-based compendium of seclusion and restraint guidelines directed to the prevention of and reduction in use of these practices.



All firms interested in being considered for this potential acquisition shall submit a written request for a copy of the solicitation to the above address by 3:00 PM  EST July 31, 2003. 
E-mail and fax are accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cell Regulation and Carcinogenesis (LCRC), plans to procure a Fluorescence Package Upgrade for an existing laser capture microscopy system, from Arcturus Engineering Inc., 1220 Terra Bella Avenue, Mountain View, CA 94043.  LCRC continues its strong tradition of emphasis on the study of the family of key regulatory peptides known as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), with focus on understanding both its basic biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry, as well as its roles in disease pathogenesis.  Areas of research include identification of underlying mechanisms of epithelial carginogenesis in prostate, breast, gastric, and other cancers, with emphasis both on the dual tumor suppressive and oncogenic activities of TFG-beta, its receptors and hormonal regulation of prostate and breast cancer.  The LRCR studies mechanism of signal transduction from the novel TFG-beta receptor serine-thereonine kinases, and the mechanisms of TFG-beta action in regulation of immune cell function, particularly as it relates to disease pathogenesis.  The scope and breadth of the research in the LCRC provides a framework for integrating basic molecular and mechanistic studies with more complex animal model systems including transgenic and knock-out mice as well as conditional knock-out mice.  Reccurence of breast cancer generally occurs after a long latent period and metastasis may become manifested a decade or more after primary treatement.  The Molecular mechansm involved in the recurrence of breast cancer is largely unknown.  Currently the only technology known to the NCI which is capable of performing such studies is through the use of laser capture microscopy (LCM) to obtain pure population of labeled metastaic cells in vivo.  Arcturus Engineering is the only known source to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned fluorescent upgrade system for the existing LCM equipment.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requiremetns.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT, (local Washington, D.C. time) on July 23, 2003.  If you have any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considereed solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code is 423450.

<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), Washington, DC.
Purpose:
	Minorities represent less than 10% of mental health professionals.  Increasing the numbers of racial and ethnic minority mental-health professionals is necessary to serve their own communities, to promote responsiveness to the unique needs of culturally diverse groups and to contribute to the overall quality of the mental health system. 

	Traditionally, few minorities select the specialty of psychiatry, and even fewer, an advanced residency of two more years in child and adolescent psychiatry.  Nevertheless, surveys have repeatedly identified the need for an increase in the number of child and adolescent psychiatrists to meet existing clinical needs (AACAP, 1989).  Because so few medical students enter child and adolescent psychiatry, and even fewer are from minority groups, minority presence needs to be expanded.  As the United States population becomes more ethically and racially diverse, the number of practitioners serving this community needs to increase proportionately.  The treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of mental illnesses experienced by child and adolescent minorities are best handled by minority psychiatrists who are sensitive to their own culture’s unique requirements.  The AACAP understands that if minority medical students are not introduced to child and adolescent psychiatry, they will not pursue careers in this area.  Therefore, promising minority medical students must be exposed to the clinical practice of child and adolescent psychiatry. 

	Surveys and interviews with medical specialists in general, and child and adolescent psychiatrists in particular, illustrate that the key to stimulating interest is early exposure to challenging clinical experiences and personal contact with mentors.  Child and adolescent psychiatry must be presented as a viable career for minority medical students and as an opportunity for them to serve their communities in a very critical way.


	The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) is the only U.S. professional association of child and adolescent psychiatrists.  Its membership (6,400) includes the leading researchers, academics, and practitioners in the field.  The Academy’s monthly journal (Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry) and Annual Meeting both include scientific and clinical papers and presentations about all aspects of child and adolescent mental disorders.

<SUBJECT>R -- Integrating Behavioral health services into Virginia''s Primary Care Settings
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-03M000236
<RESPDATE>073103
<ARCHDATE>08152003
<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the Virginia Primary Care Association, INC.  Richmond, VA.
Purpose:
 Objective: The objective of this is to complete the work initiated by the Virginia Primary Care Association under the HRSA/SAMHSA Mental and Behavioral Health Summit Initiative.  This initiative, originally planned for multiple years, was prematurely discontinued. Virginia had not yet completed the actions necessary for fully developing technical assistance materials and identifying and implementing a set of strategies for increasing the integration of physical and behavioral health within these community health settings.  The specialized behavioral health focus of this initiative was the introduction and continued support of screening and brief intervention for persons with substance use problems.  One part of this initiative involved the Virginia Community Health Centers, which serve distinct portions of the State, as well as distinct segments of the Virginia population. 

The report, “Shortages of Mental Health Professionals in Virginia”, documents that many areas of Virginia, especially rural areas, continue to suffer from inadequate access to specialty behavioral services.  While this lack of access to specialty behavioral services cannot be compensated for in its entirety, given adequate technical assistance resources, primary care clinics, especially those in rural areas may be able to provide some appropriate behavioral health services, including screening and brief intervention.
In health care, screening refers to a process designed to identify people who have or are at risk of having an illness or disorder.  The purpose of screening is to target persons for treatment, so as to reduce the long-term morbidity and mortality related to the condition.  In addition, by intervening early and raising the individual’s concern about the risk factors and substance related problems, it is expected that screening for drug and alcohol problems in community settings, can itself, reduce subsequent use.  In addition, some types of clinical approaches to patients, for example, Brief Intervention, may also be appropriately delivered within the primary care setting by trained staff.  A variety of models for Brief Intervention exist, ranging from relatively unstructured advice giving to counseling and formalized feedback. 

No Screening and Brief Intervention models have been specifically designed for use within Community Health Clinics (CHC), for the staffing at such clinics or for use with a relatively poor and significantly rural population.  For successful implementation to occur, technical assistance materials need to be developed that are customized and appropriate to the specific audience(s).  In addition, strategies for dissemination and engagement of the Virginia CHC’s and CHC staff in the process must occur if the introduction of screening and brief intervention for substance use problems is to succeed. 

 THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED

Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.  (E) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of “very good” or lower.  In that event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  (x) The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD) intends to award a sole source contract to The Nida Corporation, located at 300 S. John Rodes Blvd, Melbourne, FL 32904, for the purchase of standardized classroom instruction of prototype curricula.  The Naval Education and Training Center (NETC), Naval Personnel Development Command (NPDC) has a requirement for the development and delivery of standardized classroom instruction prototype curricula in the field of Electricity, Electronics Communication and Radar (EEC&R).  The standards and curricula for these prototype courses shall be based upon the results of a front-end analysis (FEA) currently being conducted with the Nida Corporation and conducted upon the electronics equipment of which the Nida Corporation is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  This effort requires in-depth knowledge of the FEA, the ability to apply the results of the FEA to the standardization of the prototype curricula.  This effort also requires an in-depth knowledge of the electronics equipment currently in place, as well as the new equipment required by the FEA.  Pursuing award through competition would result in substantial duplication of costs that the Government would not recover through the competitive process and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling NPDCs mission requirements.  This prototyping effort is expected to have a 15-month period of performance.  Following the proof of concept resultant from this prototyping effort, the Government intends to pursue full and open competition for the continued instruction of the prototyped curricula.  This is not a request for quotation, nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  This contract modification will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD) intends to enter into negotiations with the Nida Corporation in ten (10) business days after publication of this notice.  Questions regarding this acquisition strategy may be directed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Kate Holcomb, e-mail address: katherine.holcomb@navy.mil or NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD), 12350 Research Parkway, Attn: Kate Holcomb Code 25333, Orlando, FL 32826.

This sole source procurement is justified based on the fact that Virginia Tech is uniquely qualified in the area of sensitivity analysis of indoor air quality simulation results based on their extensive work in the area of exposure analysis. Additionally, NIST is not aware of any other organization that has this unique expertise to fulfill the required tasks.

The Government anticipates the award of a commercial firm-fixed price (FFP) purchase order for a twelve (12) month period of performance on or about August 4, 2003.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The following is the Government’s response to questions regarding the above referenced solicitation.

Question 1.  The RFP specifies “top-level” coverage of each DHS mission area.  Please comment further on the depth of coverage.  In terms of the news topics included, and the sources to be used, will the human news editors deliver (a) exhaustive coverage all news stories of interest to officials within each mission area, even if a number of these stories do not rise to the level of DHS-wide interest, or (b) a broad briefing covering all DHS mission areas, but intentionally culled of lower-priority news stories?  Or is there a better way to convey the level of depth required?

Government’s Response:  This requirement is for only “top-level” coverage which includes all articles concerning the Department of Homeland Security.  This includes all major newspapers, local area coverage, the wire services, international newspapers such as the financial times, and national and local television coverage. 

Question 2.  The RFP requires inclusion of “the full-length version of news articles outlined in the news summary.”  Is it sufficient to provide within the summary briefing document a hypertext link which connects directly to each full-length article appearing on the Internet? 

Government’s Response.  Yes.  Within the clips package, a hypertext link shall be provided to the full-text version of news articles outlined in the news summaries.

Question 3.  Section 508 Accessibility Standards.  The service as described would be text based and would be viewed on the IP-protected Web site and delivered to DHS in electronic format (MSWord) for on-site printing to hard copy.  Can you envision a scenario in which the vendor would be required to do more than this in order to comply with 508?  If so, what might the vendor be required to do?

Government’s Response.  No.  The contractor is only required to comply with the Section 508 Accessibilities Standards at (www.section508.gov).

Question 4.  The solicitation requires the creation of an IP-protected web site.  Do you have a standard for which web programming language should be used to accomplish this IP protection (Perl, ASP, Cold Fusion, ...)?  If not, can the contractor choose which language to use?

Government’s Response.  No, not at this time.  The contractor can choose the language to use for this requirement.

Question 5.  Will the contractor be required to both create and host (that is, provide a computer as a web server) the IP-protected web site or will the contractor only be required only to build the site?

Government’s Response.  Yes.  This requirement is to create and host the IP-protected web site.

Question 6.  The solicitation stipulates that the web site will maintain a 30+ day archive. Should this say "31 day" or "one month" archive?

Government’s Response.  No.  A 30+ archive means that it will carry anywhere from a 30 day archive and more.  The minimum requirement is 30 days.  However, there is no stipulation on the maximum days of the archive. 

Question 7.  The solicitation stipulates "The summary brief shall be sent electronically in a compatible format (MS Word) Monday through Friday (except Federal holidays), by 7 a.m., to five DHS personnel."  Because MS Word can become infected with a VB-based worm or virus, would you consider another format (e.g., Adobe Acrobat)?

Government’s Response.  MS Word is the minimum requirement.  However, another format in addition to MS Word would be considered.

Question 8.  The solicitation requires that the briefings be delivered daily by 7:00 a.m. (EST) on each federal workday, Monday through Friday.  Is electronic delivery sufficient?

Government’s Response.  The summary brief is to be provided electronically and on the website daily by 7:00 a.m. (EST).  
 
Question 9.  The RFP requires coverage of local television and other media sources. Please clarify what is intended by 'local' or the scope of 'local'. Do you have an idea of how many local sources are to be covered, and does that mean local to Washington, DC or local regional sources.

Government’s Response.  Local means the local TV affiliate stories concerning Homeland Security, as well as the local newspapers.  For example, if Secretary Ridge is traveling in a local area, we want the coverage of that visit in the clips.  By "local", we mean local television and newspaper articles.  

Question 10.  Approximately how many news stories are you expecting to be covered on a daily basis?  

Government’s Response.  The requirement is to provide a complete and comprehensive review and summary/analysis of “all” top-level coverage of news stories on a daily basis.

<DESC>This amendment to PRDA solicitation 03-59, Transformational Communication MILSATCOM Network Technical Requirements Definition Study, extends the proposal due date from 18 July 2003 to 4 August 2003, and revises Special Contract Requirement (SCR) SMC-H006, Organizational Conflicts of Interest (July 2003).  Changes made to the uploaded model contract are shown in bold font.  The central paragraph of the OCI clause is revised as follows: “(i) The Government places the highest priority on protecting the integrity of the TCM Space and Network Segment acquisitions by precluding either segment from biasing the independent development of other’s design or by creating an unfair competitive advantage.  Contractors interested in competing for both the Space and Network Segment acquisitions shall submit OCI plans that prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might bias the contractor’s judgment and provide unfair competitive advantages.  Contractors will address the scope and magnitude of work under consideration and the impacts of having the same division of a company work on both segments.  The TCM Network PRDA prime contractor shall submit an OCI risk mitigation plan addressing all prime or subcontractor activity that presents a potential or actual OCI as defined in FAR Subpart 9.505.  This restriction will permit subcontractors with essential expertise to assist in optimizing the TCM Network architecture in multiple segments while mitigating the potential for bias.”

The MILSATCOM Joint Program Office (MJPO), HQ Space & Missile Systems Center, requests proposals to support the development and validation of technical requirements for the Transformational Communication MILSATCOM (TCM) Network.  The MJPO anticipates awarding up to two Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts to individual firms or teams responding to this solicitation, in accordance with FAR SubPart 35.016, Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), as modified for the Air Force’s Program Research & Development Announcement (PRDA) process.

<DESC>IF YOU WOULD LIKE A MORE EASILY READABLE COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT SUE PROCTOR AT 708-786-5182 OR SUSAN.PROCTOR@MED.VA.GOV SUBJ: Sources Sought Notice for Wound Care Products This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various wound care products. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system. The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA_s purchasing of products. BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME. Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date. Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below. If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME. Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process. Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process. If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria. NOTE: ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED (INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF ANY KITS) MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO). THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES. A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559. All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer_s name. Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples. Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available. Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed. If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria. In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples. Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent. If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation. Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period. This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization. Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award. For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183. Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples. If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract. The VHA Wound Care User Group, a group of VA nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted. VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts. Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable. **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Acquisition and Analysis Service (049A5S), ATTN: Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL 60141** SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN JULY 28, 2003. Companies not submitting samples by this date may be eliminated from consideration on any subsequent procurement action for these items.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  This document is for information and planning purposes and to promote competition.  This is a Request for Information issued by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Headquarters Procurement Office to seek industry comments and inputs for the administration of the NASA Resident Research Associateship Program (RRAP). The Contractor will recruit, screen, evaluate, select, place (including payment of stipends and associated costs), and maintain on tenure postdoctoral and senior postdoctoral guest research associates at NASA Centers for one year, with the potential to renew for a second year. The objective of this Program is to provide scientists and engineers of unusual promise and abilities the opportunities for professional experiences that are also compatible with the research interests of the sponsoring NASA Centers. NASA is seeking capabilities from small, small disadvantage, and women-owned small businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for this requirement.  Potential sources shall provide a letter of interest including their name, location, and size; a capability statement that demonstrates their understanding of the work requirements, as well as their qualifications, capabilities, and experience and past performance history for such work.  This information must be detailed because the purpose of this synopsis is to identify businesses capable of performing this work.  Please submit your responses to Ms. Jamiel C. Commodore, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Mail Code 210.H, Greenbelt, MD  20771, by E-mail at Jamiel.C.Commodore@nasa.gov, or by fax to (301) 286-0357.  Responses via regular mail or fax should also be provided via an electronic copy in Microsoft Word format. The closing date for responses is 30 calendar days from the issuance of this notice.  All information received from this RFI will be combined and used for Government procurement planning purposes only.  Sources are urged to describe their approach in enough detail so that NASA can plan for subsequent proposal opportunities for which proprietary information is appropriate.    The information received in response to this RFI will be reviewed and summarized by a panel of experts.  Some or no part of the summarized and synthesized recommendations may or may not form the basis of a future NASA solicitation, such as a NASA Request for Proposals.   This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.	Any questions regarding this announcement should be directed to the identified point of contact.   An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".   The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA GSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?group=C&pin=51.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of the solicitation and amendments, if any.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any.  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:  http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>Small businesses qualified to respond to the following Statement of W= ork (SOW), shall e-mail only phone calls will not be returned) the Contract= ing Officer at Phyliss.Schlegel@faa.gov by close of business July 22, 2003,=  with a request to receive the Screening Information Request (SIR).  Draft = SOW follows: C.1=09 Introduction The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Aviation Risk Analysis Section = (AAR-490) is responsible for conducting research in the area of risk manage= ment decision support in support of the Flight Standards System Approach to=  Safety Oversight (SASO) program.  The primary sponsor for the research is = the Flight Standards Certification & Surveillance Division (FSAIC), which i= s part of the Flight Standards Division (AFS) of the Certification and Regu= lation (AVR) Directorate of the FAA.  AFS directs, manages and executes cer= tification, inspection and surveillance activities to ensure adequacy of fl= ight procedures, operating methods, airmen qualification and proficiency, a= ircraft maintenance, and the maintenance aspects of continuous airworthines= s programs. =20 C.2=09 Project Background and Objectives The Risk Management Decision Support Strategic Plan describes Task number 2= .0, Aviation System (AS) Functional Model, as follows: The purpose of this task is to develop functional models of the aviation sy= stem, e.g., 14 CFR Parts 121 (Operating Requirements: Domestic, Flag, And S= upplemental Operations), 142 (Training Centers), and 145 (Repair Stations).=   The developed functional model will be one input (examples of other input= s are historical accidents/incidents, hazards in similar industries, etc.) = to the task titled as AS Risk Analysis, which is partly geared to identify = those work processes (or business processes) that are vital to maintain or = increase the desired level of safety.  The developed functional models will=  also facilitate the communication between the FAA and industry.=20 Over the past several years, the FAA and industry developed the Air Carrier=  Operations System Model (ACOSM) and the Repair Stations Functional Model (= RSFM).  Model development of Training Centers and Agricultural Aircraft Ope= rations is currently underway. The Risk Management Decision Support Strategic Plan describes Task 3.0, Ove= rsight System (OS) Functional and Data Models, as follows: The purpose of this task is to develop a functional and data model of selec= ted components of the current OS.  The goal is to develop a logical model o= f the OS functions and data rather than a physical model.  Recall that the = logical model deals with "what" is being executed whereas the physical mode= l deals with "how" the things are being executed.   The developed functiona= l and data models of the OS and AS functional model would be a basis to con= duct the research.  Therefore, the developed models of the OS should be as = close as possible to the current oversight system. A model of the Certification Process will begin shortly.  However, the FAA = will benefit from an "Assessment of Aviation System Modeling Efforts;" that=  is, take a step back and evaluate the current models and methodologies to = address the following questions: Modeling Tool - Is the FAA using the modeling methodology best suited for i= ts needs? =20 Knowledge Elicitation - How effective are the currently employed methods to=  capture the knowledge of participants to develop the models? =20 Modeling Standards - How can standards be developed so that the same approa= ch is used each time a model is developed? C.3=09 General Requirements=20 The following information applies to all deliverables on this contract.  De= liverables are subject to the FAA Contracting Officer's Technical Represent= ative's (COTR) approval.  Drafts will be reviewed and returned within 15 da= ys after receipt.  All products shall be delivered in hard copy form to the=  address identified in 1.1.1, Identification and Address, and in electronic=  form via the FAA e-mail system.  The format for all submissions shall be i= n the MS Office or Adobe Acrobat format designated by the COTR.  The contra= ctor shall submit monthly financial and status reports within 5 days of the=  end of the month that detail the costs incurred and any problems that aris= e in execution of the contract.  The monthly reports shall also contain a t= ravel section to identify the purpose of any trip, personnel encountered, a= nd pertinent information obtained from the visit. C.4=09Required Tasks and Deliverables The contractor shall furnish all the resources-facilities, supplies, person= nel, materials and services necessary to perform the duties defined below. Task One:  Review the current models for the purpose of identifying strengt= hs and weaknesses.  The contractor shall: Review the Air Carrier Operations System Models, Repair Station and Trainin= g Center Functional Models. Work with AAR-490 and Flight Standards personnel to understand the philosop= hy that underlies the need for the models and model development. =09Upon conclusion of the review, provide a written report that summarizes = the findings and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of each of the cur= rent models. Task Two:  Review the literature to identify other methodologies that will = address the following concerns: Modeling Tool. A team of FAA and Industry personnel developed the aviation = system models using the Integrated Definition for Functional Modeling (IDEF= 0) methodology for the purpose of describing the functions within a specifi= c operation, i.e., air carriers, agricultural operations.  These models con= tain much detail and at times, are difficult to read, but then, so are the = products of other modeling methodologies.  Aviation safety inspectors will = now use the models that were originally developed for use by analysts, memb= ers of the research community, and industry.  In addition, IDEF0 will also = be used to develop models of the various oversight processes.  Thus there a= re several concerns: Is IDEF0 the best methodology to be used to model parts of the aviation sys= tem?  IS IDEFO the best method to model the oversight system? Will the IDEF0 methodology be easily understood by various groups of users? In Task One, it is expected that the contractor will gain an understanding = of the purpose, uses, and users of the existing models in order to assess t= he currently used methodology, including BPWin (the software used to create=  the models) and other potential methodologies.  The contractor shall deliv= er a report assessing the current methodology and other proposed methodolog= ies, including their strengths and weaknesses, and recommend that either th= e FAA should continue using the current methodology or adopt a new one.  In=  either case, the contractor will be expected to justify their recommendati= ons. If the contractor believes the FAA should continue to use IDEF0, but b= elieve there are better ways to use the methodology/software, then the cont= ractor will address those recommendations in the report.  If the contractor=  recommends a new methodology, then he/she shall describe why it is a bette= r methodology over the current one and will also address the following: Provide an example of how one of the models will be presented using this ne= w methodology.=20 Describe an estimated level of effort to convert the existing models using = the new methodology. Knowledge Elicitation. Groups of FAA and Industry representatives periodica= lly attend meetings and use a technique called "brainstorming" to capture t= he inputs, outputs, controls, and mechanisms of the functions.  This proces= s can result in model development taking several years to complete which is=  neither effective nor efficient.   Thus the question is what other knowled= ge elicitation methodologies could be used to capture knowledge to develop = the models, i.e. meet with smaller groups, use structured interviews, and s= o forth.  The contractor shall address various knowledge elicitation method= ologies, their strengths and weaknesses, and recommend a methodology that t= he FAA could adopt for use in future model development.  =20 Modeling Standards.   While the software used to develop the model provides=  some standardization, it does not prohibit team members from either provid= ing too detailed or too limiting definitions of functions, inputs, outputs,=  controls, and mechanisms.  Also, different groups of experts are used to d= evelop the models and each group may develop their own philosophy as to how=  to develop the model, address issues uniquely associated with a model unde= r development, and so forth.  The contractor shall provide recommendations = as to how standards may be developed and implemented to support consistent = model development.

<DESC>PURPOSE:  The Navy seeks to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regard to privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, “Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.”   Naval Support Activity Mid-South       is seeking interest and information specifically for the privatization of Water and Wastewater utilities systems.  The resulting privatization will include assumption of ownership, operation and maintenance, and obligation to continue the service for an indefinite and ongoing period.  

OBJECTIVE: Should privatization result, the ownership of the entire utility plant and/or distribution system, including all operating responsibility shall transfer to a regional or municipal utility or to a private company.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower, and overhead costs shall become the utility provider’s responsibility.  It is intended that privatization will reduce the Navy’s life cycle costs

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:  The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size and general description of the system.  Any numbers may only be estimates for this purpose.  NSA POTABLE WATER SYSTEM: 
The water system supply draws water from five wells.  The water is treated in a 4.0 MGD capacity water treatment plant constructed in the 1986 timeframe and comprised of the following facilities: a water operations/filter building with fully equipped laboratory; chemical feed systems consisting of fluoride, polyphosphate, polymer, and caustic feed systems, and a new sodium hypochlorite disinfection system; a backwash facility; a coke tray aerator facility; a pump building for pumping finished water from the underground reservoir to the distribution system and/or the elevated storage tank; a 2 million gallon underground reservoir; an underground pump station; and a drain pump station.  There is also a new 0.5 million gallon elevated storage tank currently under construction (NOTE: The existing 0.5 million gallon elevated storage tank will be transferred to the City of Millington upon completion of the new elevated tank and is not included in this privatization effort).   The distribution system is comprised of approximately 134,550 feet of piping.  The lines vary in size from 6 to 12 inches.  There are approximately 232 hydrants.  NSA WASTEWATER: The wastewater collection system consists of approximately 96,800 feet of gravity and force mains.  The lines vary in size from 4 to 30 inches.  There are approximately 460 manholes and four lift stations.  There is no wastewater treatment plant.  Wastewater treatment is provided by the City of Millington under contractual agreement with the Navy.

PROCEDURES: This request for interested parties is for gathering information and is one required component of a complete and systematic process to evaluate interested parties under the Department of the Navy’s utilities privatization program.  In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with a formal request for proposals.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  SHOULD INTEREST BE DETERMINED SUFFICIENT, A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS MAY BE FORTHCOMING.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead (not to exceed 20 pages in length).  The statement shall include as a minimum the following criteria:  (1) capability and experience in the ownership operation and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial capacity to purchase, expand, and operate a utility system; (3) a statement showing its understanding of an obligation to provide continuous utility service; (4) understanding of any applicable state or local utility law or franchise requirements, and capability of complying with such requirements; (5) understanding of the federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations and its familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the state of  Tennessee and US Environmental Protection Agency, Region - 4.  Elaborate proposals or pricing information is neither required nor desired.  Any innovative and new conceptual ideas to achieve stated objectives are encouraged.  It should be noted that individual RFIs for different utility systems may be issued in the same time frame.  A separate response to each RFI is required.

<DESC>INFORMATION ANALYSIS AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION DIRECTORATE, NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
CELLULAR USER REGISTRATION
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION


1.	INTRODUCTION
1.1	Scope
The Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate, National Communications System (NCS), Department of Homeland Security desires to better understand the user registration process used by U.S. cellular networks (for roaming users and users in their home networks) and to identify the roles that carriers, vendors, and third parties play in the process.  This request for information (RFI) seeks technical information regarding the cellular registration process.  Responses from all organizations, including commercial entities, academic institutions, and Government departments and agencies, are encouraged. 

The NCS has researched publicly available information on normal registration procedures, architectures, third party service providers, and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard 41 and would like to verify public source information and gain additional knowledge by discussing user registration with knowledgeable industry players.  The NCS is focused on generic serving areas, but information on specific areas would be welcomed.  Within the cellular registration process, the NCS is most interested in aspects that impact the ability to successfully complete calls under all network contingencies, including congestion and damage scenarios.
1.2	Background
The NCS is responsible for providing assured connectivity for the President and Federal departments and agencies under all circumstances, including crises and national emergencies.  Under the provisions of Executive Order 12472, the NCS is responsible for ensuring that a national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications infrastructure exists and is responsive to the needs of the President and the Federal departments and agencies through the use of public and private telecommunications systems.  In support of this mission, the Office of the Manager, NCS (OMNCS) has initiated several programs designed to overcome network failure and congestion during emergency situations.  The NCS developed the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS), Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP), and Wireless Priority Service (WPS) to address priority service for Federal, State, and local personnel during an emergency. 

WPS provides NS/EP users with priority access to resources at key bottleneck points in U.S. cellular networks during call set-up.  However, WPS does not address the process of user information exchange performed whenever a cellular user activates his/her handset in a different network or service area.  Cellular users may receive service from many cellular switches as they travel across the nation.  Each cellular switch must be able to access information about the user's service to process calls appropriately.  Thus, it is important that the NCS understand the information exchange process.  Working with industry to enhance the user information exchange process is currently outside the current scope of WPS, but may be of interest to the OMNCS in the future.
2.	AREAS OF INTEREST
The NCS would like to gain additional information regarding the following areas:
2.1	Players and Roles
The NCS requires information on the role played by various industry organizations in the cellular user registration process, including carriers, equipment vendors, and third parties such as clearing houses.  Specifically, the NCS is interested in identifying the entities on which carriers rely to support user registration, their role, and their criticality to the ability of users to initiate or receive calls.
2.2	User Data Distribution 
The NCS requires technical architecture information about the physical distribution of home location registers (HLR) or other databases critical to the registration process.  Information regarding the typical number of HLRs in both metropolitan and rural areas is requested, as well as information on the number of users and geographic area served by these databases and their relation to other key network components such as visitor location registers (VLRs) and mobile switching centers (MSCs).  
2.3	User Data Redundancy
The NCS requests information regarding redundancy of cellular user information in the HLR and other databases critical to the registration process.  The NCS is also interested in the time and effort needed for the HLR recovery after data or network problems occur.

<DESC>AETC CONS has submitted this sources sought notice in an effort to recruit either HubZone contractors in the Pensacola area, 8(a) contractors or small businesses that are able to perform the following services: Air Education and Training Command (AETC) needs civilian pilots to fly Air Force T-1A aircraft on Intermediate Navigator training course sorties at Pensacola NAS.

These civilian pilots must be type rated in the Beech 400 jet.  These civilian pilots must either be commercial pilots type rated in the Beech 400 with an instructor pilot rating in the Beech 400, or they must be an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) rated pilot with a type rating in the Beech 400 jet.

In addition to flying local training sorties for student navigators in the Intermediate Navigator training course, ferry flights of the aircraft must be made for periodic maintenance inspections at Laughlin AFB in Del Rio, Texas.  These periodic maintenance inspections are required after approximately each 200 flying hours on each airframe.

Student loading in the Intermediate Navigator training course at Pensacola NAS can vary from 120 students annually to 360 students annually.  If maximum student loading is experienced, an annual flight load of approximately 6,800 hours for the Intermediate Navigator training course can be expected.

The pilots who fly the Intermediate Navigator training course sorties act as the pilot in command of the sortie.  This entails a preflight briefing, filing of a flight plan, review of aircraft maintenance forms, preflight of the aircraft, use of all Air Force applicable checklists, obtaining a clearance, taxiing the aircraft, flying a prebriefed profile, filling out aircraft maintenance forms after the flight which could include a maintenance personnel debrief, and a crew debriefing.

The contractor should plan on maintaining administrative tracking of all personnel to include tracking of currency of all pilots flying Air Force aircraft.

Supervision of all airborne Air Force T-1A aircraft must also be performed by a rated pilot on the ground.  This ground supervisor aids airborne crews with inflight emergencies.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking sources capable of providing the agency with an integrated web-based notice generation system for its manual and semi-automated notices.  This notice generation system must be capable of generating over 200 different notice types.  It must handle input from up to fifteen separate notice generation systems and accept input records containing paragraph identifiers and fill-in values without changing the record format.  SSA currently uses a variety of mainframe and PC-based notice preparation/generation systems and is seeking a product to provide a mainframe-based notice generation system to replace three of its current standalone notice generation systems.   As background, SSA sends its customers over 240 million notices annually.  While the majority of notices are produced by several different automated mainframe notice systems, a significant number of notices are produced in some manual or semi-automated fashion that requires employee intervention using numerous non-integrated systems.   These various notice systems are both mainframe and PC based.  SSA is looking to consolidate its various manual and semi-automated notice systems into one, mainframe or web-based notice generation system.  The notice generation solution that SSA is seeking must include the following features/capabilities: Off-the-shelf, field-proven and commercially available; Accessible to employees with disabilities (i.e., fully compliant with the standards imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act/Section 508); Allow for the preparation of a notice to a client from a predefined list of more than 200 different notice “templates” in both English and Spanish.  Notices consists of client name and address, static language with variable fill ins, optional standard paragraphs, optional free-form text, etc.--each formatted with SSA notice headings, return address, signature and enclosures; Provide ability to propagate data (such as name and address) from SSA’s master records based on the Social Security Number (SSN).  The user may choose to enter this information directly rather than retrieving it from SSA’s master records; provide ability to use static language and optional standard paragraphs obtained from a central language repository.  This repository is in an Oracle database and the language is tagged in SGML; Provide the ability to pre-fill variable fill-ins (such as pronouns and titles) from retrieved or pre-entered data and to; Provide the ability to prompt users to enter data and/or text in certain paragraphs; Allow for non standard paragraphs in free form text that the user can enter; Allow for the notice heading, return address, signature and other formatting to be predetermined by SSA policy; Provide an interface from which designated SSA object program notice files can be loaded, edited and maintained until completion; Maintain a local list of frequently-used addresses for easy inclusion as the client name and address data on any notice; Produce an action record for forwarding to a central location for batch printing, mailing and archiving of the notice; Provide formatting of the notice so that it can be printed on a PC/LAN-based printer in one of over 1,300 SSA field offices and also on a high-speed printer in Advance Function Presentation (AFP) format at a central location; Provide the capability of printing variations of a single document such as an annotated file copy, attorney copy, etc.; Allow for centralized, batch printing that provides the ability to pre-select a set of cases based on a particular profile and generate the same type of notice for each which incorporates variable data from the database; Allow for the creation of a new notice for inclusion in the predefined list of choices; Allow creation and editing of the standard language in a sub set of notices for local or regional use; Allow copying of standard language stored at the central facility for ease of preparation; allow customization of local office information for return address and fill in entries; Allow access by other client/server applications so notices required by any application are produced by this one notice generation system; Allow text entry via an interface to allow word processor type functions such as cutting, pasting, spelling and grammar checking (in both English and Spanish), formatting, etc. while viewing the entire notice; Provide an online help system that provides assistance with use of the application and is customizable to include information on the SSA notices available to users; Provide a “work queue” capability to allow incomplete notices that require an end-user to review and complete the notice to be directed to the proper person/location; The solution must not require changes to the existing operating system, hardware or application software in use at SSA. This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the data received. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, the information will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources. All responsible sources should visit the Section 508 evaluation template at http://www.ssa.oag/acq/oag_acquisition.htm and submit it with their response to this announcement.  Responses to this notice should be submitted in duplicate by August 1, 2003 and will not be honored or acknowledged.  Faxed responses are not permitted.  Questions concerning this announcement may be submitted via email ONLY.

<DESC>IF YOU WOULD LIKE A MORE EASILY READABLE COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT SUE PROCTOR AT 708-786-5182 OR SUSAN.PROCTOR@MED.VA.GOV SUBJ:  Sources Sought Notice for Wound Care Products  This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various wound care products.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA_s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date.   Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process.  Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria.   NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED (INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF ANY KITS) MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer_s name.  Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.  In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.  If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183.  Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples.  If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract. The VHA Wound Care User Group, a group of VA nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable.   **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Acquisition and Analysis Service (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141**   SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN JULY 28, 2003.

<SUBJECT>75 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.   Items being considered are: Slim CD Cases (7045-00-NIB-0179 and 7045-00-NIB-0180); C Shell CD Cases (7045-00-NIB-0181 and 7045-00-NIB-0189); Skilcraft Toner Cartridges (7510-00-NIB-0633, 7510-00-NIB-0641, 7510-00-NIB-0642, and 7510-00-NIB-0644); Clocks, Slimline (6645-00-NIB-0102, 6645-00-NIB-0103, 6645-00-NIB-0104, 6645-00-NIB-0105, and 6645-00-NIB-0106); Markers, Permanent Impression (7520-00-NIB-1667, 7520-00-NIB-1668, 7520-00-NIB-1669, 7520-00-NIB-1670, 7520-00-NIB-1671, 7520-00-NIB-1672, 7520-00-NIB-1673, 7520-00-NIB-1674, 7520-00-NIB-1675, and 7520-00-NIB-1676); Markers, Liquid Impression (7520-00-NIB-1677, 7520-00-NIB-1678, 7520-00-NIB-1679, 7520-00-NIB-1680, 7520-00-NIB-1681, 7520-00-NIB-1682, 7520-00-NIB-1683, and 7520-00-NIB-1684); and Stapler, Stand Up – Vertical Grip (7520-00-NSH-0200).  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Aerosol Collector Technology
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES TO COMMERCIALIZE AEROSOL COLLECTOR TECHNOLOGY

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's high air volume to low liquid volume aerosol collector technology.  Various licensing opportunities are available.  

Scientists and engineers at LLNL have developed a compact, low power consumption, and high efficiency aerosol collector that collects airborne particles and microorganisms from a large volume of air into a small volume of liquid.

Continuous air monitoring, such as in detecting airborne pathogens and other pollutants, needs an aerosol collector that continuously collects air samples and concentrates the airborne materials into a liquid sample for subsequent preparation and analysis.  Most commercial aerosol collectors now available for field use are large, power consuming, and produce collected sample into large volumes of liquid, typically more than 10 mL. When using them, the sample volume must be “sub-sampled,” effectively diluting the sample, resulting in a loss of sensitivity of detection.  Emerging miniature detection systems analyze much smaller sample volumes, typically less than 1 mL. 

LLNL’s invention is a new technique for the design of the new aerosol collector.  It can collect particulates at a high airflow rate and deliver them into a liquid volume of 1 mL or less.  

The unique features of the new aerosol collector make it an ideal next generation air sampler for continuous air quality monitoring and airborne pathogen detection.  The device is awarded a US Patent 6,520,034, for its novel design and features.  

The following table outlines specifications of LLNL’s aerosol collector.  The device can be scaled to higher or lower airflow rates.
 

Air collection rate Primary: up to 275 lpm 
Particulate collection range 0.5-10 micron, optimized at 1 microns
Collection efficiency	>70% over  1-10 micron range
Concentration ratio	>30,000/min 
Reagent specifications	Type: 0.22 micron filtered double distilled water minimum
Physical size	6” W x 6” D x 6” H  (0.125 cubic feet)
Weight	<10 lbs. (dry)
Power Source 110V or battery
Power consumption  100 watts max
Sample extraction  On-board 22ml/min Instech peristaltic pump, output to std. flangeless connector. Air sampling may continue during extraction.
System controls	On-board processor 
Sound level  60 dB  (A) at nominal 275 lpm flow
Packaging  Mil-spec fasteners, Stainless or plastic components in airflow sections can be sterilized or bleached.
Max Operating Time  Limited by reagent storage.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's aerosol collector should provide a written statement of interest which includes the following:

1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 000032-03.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's aerosol collector technology.
