<RESPDATE>080918
<CONTACT>Cheryl Vendemia, Contract Specialist, Phone 3016196004, Email cheryl.r.vendemia.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Notice of Intent<br />The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) NMLC intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), (as implemented by FAR 6.302-1) to Illumina, Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA  92122-4616 for reagent kits for library preparation and sequencing using the MiSeq platform developed by Illumina, Inc.
<p>The Virology &amp; Emerging Infections Department of the U.S. Naval Medical and Research Unit No. 6 (NAMRU- 6) has a requirement for reagents to prepare libraries using human and animal samples that later will be sequenced in the MiSeq platform developed by Illumina, as part of the projects of next-generation sequencing (NGS) that are being developed at this command.</p>
<p>The kits shall be designed for library preparation and sequencing. The library preparation kit should include a variety of steps that include enzymatic fragmentation, size selection, end-repair, a-tail and ligation step in the same reaction. The process should allow including dual index at the 5 and 3 prime end for later sample identification. In addition, the library preparation kit should be designed to construct libraries with a low DNA input (-50ng) with master-mixed reagents ready to use. Similarly, the sequencing kit should allow us to run more than 150 sequencing cycles. Those cycles are needed to run paired-end libraries with a high quality performance.NAMRU-6 expects to have more than 2.0 Gb per sequencing run with high Q30 values. Finally, the sequencing kit should include an internal control to validate the sequencing run.</p>
<p>The items being purchased have all been validated and are compatible with the equipment in use and owned by NAMRU-6 (7500 Fast Real-Time PCR, MiSeq and MiniSeq Illumina systems). All Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed over the years using the same reagents and are the gold standard for NAMRU-6 laboratories. Design and validation of all laboratory procedures have been standardized with these items, since they have shown to perform up to standard. Assays have been developed independently for each SOP followed in the laboratories; therefore, the reagents must remain the same as the ones specified in the SOPs, otherwise, the design and validation of these processes would have to be reinitiated from zero, which would delay all processing and the timely diagnosis of public health relevant pathogens. Changing the source of reagents would mean altering the validity of the results for the surveillance studies that measure rates of disease across years.</p>
<p>Market research, based on NAMRU-6 scientific staff, prior procurements, and Internet research concluded that the items are available from only one source.  In addition, items must arrive at NAMRU-6 in Lima, Peru in accordance with a defined schedule in order to sustain the laboratory activities to meet the mission of NAMRU-6. The only way to assure that the items will arrive as required is by purchasing from one vendor. Peruvian customs clearance usually takes between 3-4 weeks, and having multiple shipments from multiple orders pending in customs could lead to some reagents being unavailable when needed for conducting for testing, this would be detrimental to mission-critical processes and ultimately lead to a delay in reporting research results and findings to our funders.</p>
<p>If capable sources are not identified through this notice, NMLC intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), (as implemented by FAR 6.302-1) to Illumina, Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA  92122-4616.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement.  Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work.  Capability statements shall not exceed one (1) page (8.5 x 11 inch) using a font size no smaller than 10-point.  All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 10:30AM Eastern Time, 9 August 2018. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: cheryl.r.vendemia.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<a href="mailto:adelina.lacroce@navy.mil">adelina.lacroce@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>The Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire, via full and open competition, Information Technology (IT) Technical support services required to facilitate the overall objective of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education; MPTE) (DCNO, MPTE) (N1) and subordinate commands.

The scope of this effort will encompass all aspects of N16 CIO and IM/IT Requirements at the Echelon I level, as well as at the Echelon II/III level at BUPERS/NPC, CNRC, and NETC. The support will require direct interaction with action officers and program managers across the MPTE enterprise as well as all other Navy Enterprises and Enablers to support N1 IM/IT responsibilities.
  In addition, support will require the development and refinement of legacy Information System (IS) sustainment and transformation to the optimized MPTE operational construct.  Finally, the contractors will provide a continuum of on-site and off-site support to N1’s action officers, program managers and analysts at all echelon levels, for multiple commands, and at multiple geographic locations. 
  
The required support is divided into ten (10) core functions: (1) CIO Strategic Support, (2) Data and Information Management, (3) Engineering Support, (4) IT System Support, (5) Network Support, (6) Information Assurance (IA)/Cyber Security, (7) Enterprise Business Intelligence (BI)/Enterprise Business Analytics, (8) Software Development, (9) Hardware Maintenance and Development, and (10) Business Process Reengineering (BPR).

Travel is anticipated.
 The Government anticipates performance will begin on 13 September 2018 and will continue, as required, for six years thereafter. For planning purposes, the total estimated yearly level of effort (LOE) is 403,200 hours (or 2,419,200 hours over the six year period). The applicable NAICs code is 541512 “Computer Systems Design Services.” The small business size standard for this NAICS is $27.5 million in annual receipts.

It is the intent of the Government to process this procurement under FAR 15, Contracting by Negotiation, and to ultimately award multiple, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) cost-plus- fixed-fee (CPFF) contracts as a result of the forthcoming solicitation.

The IDIQ contracts will allow for both CPFF and firm-fixed-price (FFP) type task orders.
 Offerors will be required to submit non-cost/price (technical) and cost/price proposals. The Government anticipates that the resultant contracts will be awarded on a best value basis where the non-cost/price (technical) volume will be considered more important than the cost/price volume.

Upon its release, the solicitation will be issued electronically and be available for downloading at the NECO website: http://www.neco.navy.mil or http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 29 March 2018. The closing date for the receipt of offers will be set forth in the RFP. Paper copies, faxed copies, or email copies of the solicitation will not be provided.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY

DISCLAIMER
This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this Notice that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.   In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this Notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this Notice. Information received as a result of this Notice will become part of our market research and will be used to determine interest and the capability of potential sources. Furthermore, those who respond to this Notice should not anticipate feedback with regard to its submission.


Introduction
This is for the third year of the Veterans Legacy Program issued in response to market research conducted under this Sources Sought Notice.
The intent of this Notice is to prepare a Request for Proposal from qualified universities to engage in a program of development for research-based digital media products as part of the Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration s (NCA) Veterans Legacy Program (VLP).  NCA has launched VLP to promote memorialization of the nation s veterans  legacy enshrined in national cemeteries.  Responses to this Notice will contribute to VLP s  Local Legacy, National Heritage  program, which seeks to create an experience of learning that builds community and commemoration of veterans  legacy, using National Cemeteries as a resource.
Responses to this Notice should address in what ways students will research, produce, and disseminate their productions based on their research on the history of veterans interred at National Cemeteries that showcase the stories of service and sacrifice of veterans interred in National Cemeteries, and the cost of each.  This research and production must be conducted under the guidance of qualified instructors (e.g. professors). Proposals should include treatment of veterans interred in VA National Cemeteries.  

Background
The Veterans Legacy Program was launched by the National Cemetery Administration on Memorial Day 2016, and is now preparing for its third full year with the goal of extending memorialization of the veterans  legacy enshrined in the national cemeteries.  NCA s initial suite of products included in-print lesson plans, digital maps, and other materials written to support the educational outreach needs of two national cemeteries in the pilot program, Riverside (CA) National Cemetery and Beaufort (SC) National Cemetery (http://www.cem.va.gov/legacy/index.asp).  NCA s goal is to develop educational outreach materials for all 136 of its national cemeteries, eventually, in media and formats that reflect the latest in research, instructional technology, and best practices.  

Requirements
NCA seeks a university to focus these efforts on a selection of national cemeteries. This program can include university faculty members in disciplines such as film, digital media, history, American Studies, graphic design, computer science, or other areas of the humanities, digital humanities, or humanities education who are willing to instruct and mentor their students on the research and the production of that research into digital media products such as film, podcasting, a social campaign documenting the process, or any combination of these or other digital media formats.
An illustration of what NCA seeks: university faculty leading a project that instructs and engages students in research that leads to commemorating the history of veterans interred in a National Cemetery and presented in variety of publicly accessible digital media formats.  University faculty would provide opportunities for students to research veterans  history and produce materials int3ended for public audiences.  

Please see media products available at Veterans Legacy Program website for examples of the standard of product we seek for lesson plans https://www.cem.va.gov/legacy/index.asp   
If the research leads to discovery of alumni of the school and/or university interred at a National Cemetery of focus, NCA would be interested in supporting the commemoration of those alumni-veterans at those national cemeteries; NCA would also support memorialization of those alumni-veterans on school/university grounds, such as the construction of memorials or monuments (include in the budget).  This illustration is only a rough sketch of what NCA seeks.  NCA is supporting and fostering a learning partnership that showcases local history and perspectives, to be featured in the research, and local interest in the forms of commemoration and memorialization.  NCA will provide access to its resources; national cemetery personnel will facilitate the research, testing, and implementation of developed materials for teachers, faculty members, and students of all levels by providing data about Veterans interred in national cemeteries.

Levels of Support
We recognize that some partnerships may differ in terms of size, internal capacity and support.  We ask proposers to acknowledge what their team s capacity will be and seek to create a distribution of award amounts to empower students and faculty from institutions of varying size.
Suggested examples of levels of support:

Up to ~$60,000:  class project 
One or two instructors of faculty rank collaborating on a project in their classes.  
Up to ~$100,000:  community-based project 
A larger faculty team, working with students through courses and/or direct recruitment.  At this level, we expect production of Veteran biographies with digital presentation, as well as creating community-based events to showcase them, at least one of which must be at the national cemetery of focus.   
Up to ~$200,000 or more:  innovation in Veteran storytelling 
Faculty team of any size (2+) engaging students at undergraduate and graduate levels through a variety of disciplines or methodologies.  Veteran biographies are shared digitally and through other means.  Community-based outreach includes a formalized partnership with a community group or facility that will host a public launch or screening of the productions.   Innovation  is determined by the disciplinary context of the intellectual leadership of the program.  This can be artistic, literary, digital, cartographical, social, or educational.

For each of the above levels of support, VLP will ask Offerors to identify the primary disciplinary focus of their team, e.g. STEM, social science, fine arts, or humanities.  RFPs at each level will state that inclusion of the student-veteran community in some way will be preferred.

Expenses Covered by NCA
In the proposed budget please indicate in the proposal the cost for each of the items specified below.  Note that the following list is neither inclusive nor definitive of costs that will be covered; if the scope and nature of your proposal requires additional items than what is covered here, please include them in the appropriate section (see below).  

NCA will support the following: reasonable additional compensation for full-time university instructional faculty named in the proposal; indirect costs (IDCs) appropriate for humanities and Education programs (required to disclose); production costs for produced materials; travel for participating students, faculty and staff between host institution and national cemeteries; cost of workforce in direct support of program.  As well, please include in your budget reasonable anticipated expenses for two team members to attend a meeting of all VLP awardees with VLP Program leadership in Washington, DC (or another city in the continental US to be specified later).  This Program meeting would entail no more than two full business days.  

Expenses Not Covered by NCA
Proposed budget can include any expenses directly related to student-centered events at national cemeteries. The following will not be supported by NCA: ordinary wages and benefits; instructional materials (e.g. textbooks); undergraduate or graduate tuition; acquisition of computer or network hardware or software not used solely for this work; food and beverages; video equipment (cameras, lighting, etc.); and clothing.

<CONTACT>Mary Wimer, Contract Specialist, Phone 4046391262, Email zmy5@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>The development of federal guidelines is a time and labor-intensive process. The CDC ME/CFS program has been advised by CDC's Office of the Associate Director for Science (OADS) that the process typically takes 3-5 years. OADS has recommended use of existing systematic literature reviews as a strategy that can help expedite the development of federal guidelines.</p>
<p>An existing systematic literature review, entitled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" (available at: https://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/evidence-based-reports/er219-abstract.html),<br />will be leveraged to serve as the foundation for ME/CFS treatment guidelines development. No other comparable and recent literature review has been published.</p>
<p>Commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and part of its Evidence Review/Technology Assessment series, the literature review was originally published in 2014 and was updated in 2016. The initial report provided a literature review for the National Institutes of Health Pathways to Prevention Workshop on Advancing the Research on Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Both the initial review and the update were completed by the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC).</p>
<p>The CDC has a requirement for updating ME/CFS treatment guidelines with recent literature and supplementing the prior review and guidelines that were recommended by the HHS CFS Advisory Committee in June, 2017. In addition, any peer-reviewed literature that could provide context to inform treatment recommendations for symptoms associated with ME/CFS warrants review and consideration.</p>
<p>Please see the attached synopsis for more details about this requirement.</p>

Offerors shall cross-reference their product to its "equal" in the solicitation via the use of part numbers or another methodology that clearly identifies what the submitted product is "equal" to. Offerors shall ensure their proposed quantities result in the same number of items required, as identified in the solicitation.<br />Salient Characteristics: Performance<br />1 each Hip implant and instrumentation or equivalent with vendor rep available in the operating <br />room during patient specific surgery scheduled for 27 April 2018. Orthopedics carries the Pinnacle Acetabular cup system, which provides sizes 38mm -72mm both Titanium gripton and Titanium poro coat, multi hole, and revision cup capabilities. The Altex liners that are used with this system provides the option of neutral, neutral+ 4, per degree +4 and constrained liners to provide maximum stability. The hip system provides options for the following different hip stems which include the Summit, Trilock, solution, AML, and reclaim. The system should include head sizes from 22mm to 40mm in both ceramic and metal options. The CORAIL Hip System offers five different primary stems and a cemented stem. The design of the extra medullary section improves the biomechanics of the stem. The low profile neck increases the range of motion of the stem within the cup before the neck impinges on the cup. The AMT taper (ARTICUL/EZE Mini Taper) captures completely the femoral head reducing the potential for impingement of the cup. The CO RAIL stem has a propriety HA coating on the grit-blasted surface. The HA coated medial to lateral taper resists axial I torsional stresses and promotes osteo integration for optimum fixation. The design of the CORAIL stem, with its titanium alloy and its full hydroxyapatite coating ensures load transfer without abnormal peak forces and allows a very low incidence of thigh pain.<br />(m) The non-FAR Part 12 discretionary FAR, DFARS, AFARS, and MEDCOM provisions included herein are incorporated into this solicitation either by reference or in full text.

<p>Non-Defense Health Agency (Non-DHA) Health Insurance Portability<br />and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Business Associate Agreement (BAA) (7 July 2014)</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(2) and 164.504(e) and paragraph C.3.4.1.3 of DoD 6025.18-R, "DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation," January 24, 2003, this document serves as a BAA between the signatory parties for purposes of the HIPAA and the "HITECH Act" amendments thereof, as implemented by the HIPAA Rules and DoD HIPAA Issuances (both defined below). The parties are a DoD Military Health System (MHS) component, acting as a HIPAA covered entity, and a DoD contractor, acting as a HIPAA business associate. The HIPAA Rules require BAAs between covered entities and business associates. Implementing this BAA requirement, the applicable DoD HIPAA Issuance (DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C3.4.1.3) provides that requirements applicable to business associates must be incorporated (or incorporated by reference) into the contract or agreement between the parties.</p>
<p>(a) Catchall Definition. Except as provided otherwise in this BAA, the following terms used in this BAA shall have the same meaning as those terms in the DoD HIPAA Rules: Data Aggregation, Designated Record Set, Disclosure, Health Care Operations, Individual, Minimum Necessary, Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP), Protected Health Information (PHI), Required By Law, Secretary, Security Incident, Subcontractor, Unsecured Protected Health Information, and Use.</p>
<p>-Breach means actual or possible loss of control, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to PHI or other PII (which may include, but is not limited to PHI), where persons other than authorized users gain access or potential access to such information for any purpose other than authorized purposes, where one or more individuals will be adversely affected. The foregoing definition is based on the definition of breach in DoD Privacy Act Issuances as defined herein.</p>
<p>-Business Associate shall generally have the same meaning as the term "business associate" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of Business Associate signatory to this BAA].</p>
<p>-Agreement means this BAA together with the documents and/or other arrangements under which the Business Associate signatory performs services involving access to PHI on behalf of the MHS component signatory to this BAA.</p>
<p>-Covered Entity shall generally have the same meaning as the term "covered entity" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of MHS component signatory to this BAA].</p>
<p>-DHA Privacy Office means the DHA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office. The DHA Privacy Office Director is the HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer for DHA, including the National Capital Region Medical Directorate (NCRMD).</p>
<p>-DoD HIPAA Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the HIPAA Rules in the DoD Military Health System (MHS). These issuances are DoD 6025.18-R (2003), DoDI 6025.18 (2009), and DoD 8580.02-R (2007).-DoD Privacy Act Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the Privacy Act, which are DoDD 5400.11 (2007) and DoD 5400.11-R (2007).</p>
<p>-HHS Breach means a breach that satisfies the HIPAA Breach Rule definition of breach in 45 CFR 164.402.</p>
<p>-HIPAA Rules means, collectively, the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and codified at 45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164, Subpart E (Privacy), Subpart C (Security), Subpart D (Breach) and Part 160, Subparts C-D (Enforcement), as amended by the 2013 modifications to those Rules, implementing the "HITECH Act" provisions of Pub. L. 111-5. See 78 FR 5566-5702 (Jan. 25, 2013) (with corrections at 78 FR 32464 (June 7, 2013)). Additional HIPAA rules regarding electronic transactions and code sets (45 CFR Part 162) are not addressed in this BAA and are not included in the term HIPAA Rules.</p>
<p>-Service-Level Privacy Office means one or more offices within the military services (Army, Navy, or Air Force) with oversight authority over Privacy Act and HIPAA privacy compliance.</p>
<p>I. Obligations and Activities of Business Associate</p>
<p>(a) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by the Agreement or as required by law.</p>
<p>(b) The Business Associate shall use appropriate safeguards, and comply with the DoD HIPAA Rules with respect to electronic PHI, to prevent use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by the Agreement.</p>
<p>(c) The Business Associate shall report to Covered Entity any Breach of which it becomes aware, and shall proceed with breach response steps as required by Part V of this BAA. With respect to electronic PHI, the Business Associate shall also respond to any security incident of which it becomes aware in accordance with any Information Assurance provisions of the Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate becomes aware that a security incident involves a Breach, the Business Associate shall immediately initiate breach response as required by part V of this BAA.</p>
<p>(d) In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii)) and 164.308(b)(2), respectively), as applicable, the Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of the Business Associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to the Business Associate with respect to such PHI.</p>
<p>(e) The Business Associate shall make available PHI in a Designated Record Set, to the Covered Entity or, as directed by the Covered Entity, to an Individual, as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity obligations under 45 CFR 164.524.</p>

<p>(g) The Business Associate shall maintain and make available the information required to provide an accounting of disclosures to the Covered Entity or an individual as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.528.</p>
<p>(h) To the extent the Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity's obligation(s) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the Business Associate shall comply with the requirements of HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to the Covered Entity in the performance of such obligation(s); and</p>
<p>(i) The Business Associate shall make its internal practices, books, and records available to the Secretary for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA Rules.</p>
<p>II. Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate</p>
<p>(a) The Business Associate may only use or disclose PHI as necessary to perform the services set forth in the Agreement or as required by law. The Business Associate is not permitted to de-identify PHI under DoD HIPAA issuances or the corresponding 45 CFR 164.514(a)-(c), nor is it permitted to use or disclose de- identified PHI, except as provided by the Agreement or directed by the Covered Entity.The Business Associate agrees to use, disclose and request PHI only in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule "minimum necessary" standard and corresponding DHA policies and procedures as stated in the DoD HIPAA Issuances.</p>
<p>(b) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the DoD HIPAA Issuances or HIPAA Privacy Rules if done by the Covered Entity, except uses and disclosures for the Business Associate's own management and administration and legal responsibilities or for data aggregation services as set forth in the following three paragraphs.</p>
<p>(c) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate. The foregoing authority to use PHI does not apply to disclosure of PHI, which is covered in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>(d) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may disclose PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate, provided that disclosures are required by law, or the Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed that it will remain confidential and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purposes for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person notifies the Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached.</p>
<p>(e) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI to provide Data Aggregation services relating to the Covered Entity's health care operations.</p>
<p>III. Provisions for Covered Entity to Inform Business Associate of Privacy Practices and Restrictions</p>
<p>(a) The Covered Entity shall provide the Business Associate with the notice of privacy practices that the Covered Entity produces in accordance with 45 CFR 164.520 and the corresponding provision of the DoD HIPAA Issuances.</p>
<p>(b) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any changes in, or revocation of, the permission by an Individual to use or disclose his or her PHI, to the extent that such changes affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.</p>
<p>(c) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any restriction on the use or disclosure of PHI that the Covered Entity has agreed to or is required to abide by under 45 CFR 164.522, to the extent that such changes may affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.</p>
<p>IV. Permissible Requests by Covered Entity</p>
<p>The Covered Entity shall not request the Business Associate to use or disclose PHI in any manner that would not be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or any applicable Government regulations (including without limitation, DoD HIPAA Issuances) if done by the Covered Entity, except for providing Data Aggregation services to the Covered Entity and for management and administrative activities of the Business Associate as otherwise permitted by this BAA.</p>
<p>V. Breach Response</p>
<p>(a) In general.</p>
<p>In the event of a breach of PII/PHI held by the Business Associate, the Business Associate shall follow the breach response requirements set forth in this Part V, which is designed to satisfy both the Privacy Act and HIPAA as applicable. If a breach involves PII without PHI, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuance breach response requirements only; if a breach involves PHI (a subset of PII), then the Business Associate shall comply with both Privacy Act and HIPAA breach response requirements. A breach involving PHI may or may not constitute an HHS Breach. If a breach is not an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate has no HIPAA breach response obligations. In such cases, the Business Associate must still comply with breach response requirements under the DoD Privacy Act Issuances.</p>
<p>If the DHA Privacy Office determines that a breach is an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with both the HIPAA Breach Rule and DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the DHA Privacy Office, regardless of whether the breach occurs at DHA or at one of the Service components. If the DHAPrivacy Office determines that the breach does not constitute an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office.<br />The Business Associate shall contact the Covered Entity for guidance when the incident is not an HHS Breach.</p>
<p>This Part V is designed to satisfy the DoD Privacy Act Issuances and the HIPAA Breach Rule as implemented by the DoD HIPAA Issuances. In general, for breach response, the Business Associate shall report the breach to the Covered Entity, assess the breach incident, notify affected individuals, and take mitigation actions as applicable. Because DoD defines "breach" to include possible (suspected) as well as actual (confirmed) breaches, the Business Associate shall implement these breach response requirements immediately upon the Business Associate's discovery of a possible breach.</p>
<p>(b) Government Reporting Provisions</p>
<p>The Business Associate shall report the breach within one hour of discovery to the Covered Entity and to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT) -the other parties as deemed appropriate by the Covered Entity. The Business Associate is deemed to have discovered a breach as of the time a breach (suspected or confirmed) is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person (other than the person committing it) who is an employee, officer or other agent of the Business Associate.</p>
<p>The Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report using the online form at https://forms.us- cert.gov/report/. Before submission to US-CERT, the Business Associate shall save a copy of the on-line report. After submission, the Business Associate shall record the US-CERT Reporting Number. Although only limited information about the breach may be available as of the one hour deadline for submission, the Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report by the deadline. The Business Associate shall e-mail updated information as it is obtained, following the instructions at http://www.us-cert.gov/pgp/email.html.<br />The Business Associate shall provide a copy of the initial or updated US-CERT report to the -Covered Entity and the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office, if requested by either. Business Associate questions about US-CERT reporting shall be directed to the Covered Entity or Service-Level Privacy Office, not the US- CERT office.</p>
<p>The additional US Army and the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) reporting requirements are addressed in the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Policy. The latest version of this policy can be obtained from the Covered Entity or the MEDCOM Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at: usarmy.jbsa.medcom.list.medcom-foia-users@mail.mil . If multiple beneficiaries are affected by a single event or related set of events, then a single reportable breach may be deemed to have occurred, depending on the circumstances. The Business Associate shall inform the Covered Entity as soon as possible if it believes that "single event" breach response is appropriate; the Covered Entity will determine how the Business Associate shall proceed and, if appropriate, consolidate separately reported breaches for purposes of Business Associate report updates, beneficiary notification, and mitigation.</p>
<p>When a Breach Report initially submitted is incomplete or incorrect due to unavailable information, or when significant developments require an update, the Business Associate shall submit a revised form or forms, stating the updated status and previous report date(s) and showing any revisions or additions in red text.<br />Examples of updated information the Business Associate shall report include, but are not limited to: confirmation on the exact data elements involved, the root cause of the incident, and any mitigation actions to include, sanctions, training, incident containment, follow-up, etc. The Business Associate shall submit these report updates promptly after the new information becomes available. Prompt reporting of updates is required to allow the Covered Entity to make timely final determinations on any subsequent notifications or reports. The Business Associate shall provide updates to the same parties as required for the initial Breach Report. The Business Associate is responsible for reporting all information needed by the Covered Entity to make timely and accurate determinations on reports to HHS as required by the HHS Breach Rule and reports to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office as required by DoD Privacy Act Issuances.</p>
<p>In the event the Business Associate is uncertain on how to apply the above requirements, the Business Associate shall consult with the Covered Entity (or the Service-Level Privacy Office, which will consult with the DHA Privacy Office as appropriate) when determinations on applying the above requirements are needed.</p>
<p>(c) Individual Notification Provisions</p>
<p>If the DHA Privacy Office determines that individual notification is required, the Business Associate shallprovide written notification to individuals affected by the breach as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the breach is discovered and the identities of the individuals are ascertained. The 10 day period begins when the Business Associate is able to determine the identities (including addresses) of the individuals whose records were impacted.</p>
<p>The Business Associate's proposed notification to be issued to the affected individuals shall be submitted to the parties to which reports are submitted under paragraph V (a) for their review, and for approval by the DHA Privacy Office. Upon request, the Business Associate shall provide the DHA Privacy Office with the final text of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals. If different groups of affected individuals receive different notification letters, then the Business Associate shall provide the text of the letter for each group. (PII shall not be included with the text of the letter(s) provided.) Copies of further correspondence with affected individuals need not be provided unless requested by the Privacy Office. The Business Associate's notification to the individuals, at a minimum, shall include the following:</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be advised of what specific data was involved. It is insufficient to simply state that PII has been lost. Where names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or truncated SSNs, and Dates of Birth (DOBs) are involved, it is critical to advise the individual that these data elements potentially have been breached.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach. The description should be sufficiently detailed so that the individual clearly understands how the breach occurred.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be informed of what protective actions the Business Associate is taking or the individual can take to mitigate against potential future harm. The notice must refer the individual to the current Federal Trade Commission (FTC) web site pages on identity theft and the FTC's Identity Theft Hotline, toll-free: 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must also be informed of any mitigation support services (e.g., one year of free credit monitoring, identification of fraud expense coverage for affected individuals, provision of credit freezes, etc.) that the Business Associate may offer affected individuals, the process to follow to obtain those services and the period of time the services will be made available, and contact information (including a phone number, either direct or toll-free, e-mail address and postal address) for obtaining more information.</p>
<p>Business Associates shall ensure any envelope containing written notifications to affected individuals are clearly labeled to alert the recipient to the importance of its contents, e.g., "Data Breach Information Enclosed," and that the envelope is marked with the identity of the Business Associate and/or subcontractor organization that suffered the breach. The letter must also include contact information for a designated POC to include, phone number, email address, and postal address.</p>
<p>If the Business Associate determines that it cannot readily identify, or will be unable to reach, some affected individuals within the 10 day period after discovering the breach, the Business Associate shall so indicate in the initial or updated Breach Report. Within the 10 day period, the Business Associate shall provide the approved notification to those individuals who can be reached. Other individuals must be notified within 10 days after their identities and addresses are ascertained. The Business Associate shall consult with the DHA Privacy Office, which will determine which media notice is most likely to reach the population not otherwise identified or reached. The Business Associate shall issue a generalized media notice(s) to that population in accordance with Privacy Office approval.</p>
<p>The Business Associate shall, at no cost to the government, bear any costs associated with a breach of PII/PHI that the Business Associate has caused or is otherwise responsible for addressing.</p>
<p>Breaches are not to be confused with security incidents (often referred to as cyber security incidents when electronic information is involved), which may or may not involve a breach of PII/PHI. In the event of a security incident not involving a PII/PHI breach, the Business Associate shall follow applicable DoD Information Assurance requirements under its Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate finds that a cyber security incident involves a PII/PHI breach (suspected or confirmed), the Business Associate shall immediately initiate the breach response procedures set forth here. The Business Associate shall also continue to follow any required cyber security incident response procedures to the extent needed to address security issues, as determined by DoD/DHA.</p>
<p>(a) TerminationTermination. Noncompliance by the Business Associate (or any of its staff, agents, or subcontractors) with any requirement in this BAA may subject the Business Associate to termination under any applicable default or other termination provision of the Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) Effect of Termination.</p>
<p>(1) If the Agreement has records management requirements, the Business Associate shall handle such records in accordance with the records management requirements. If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, the records should be handled in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) below. If the Agreement has provisions for transfer of records and PII/PHI to a successor Business Associate, or if DHA gives directions for such transfer, the Business Associate shall handle such records and information in accordance with such Agreement provisions or DHA direction.</p>
<p>(2) If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, except as provided in the following paragraph (3), upon termination of the Agreement, for any reason, the Business Associate shall return or destroy all PHI received from the Covered Entity, or created or received by the Business Associate on behalf of the Covered Entity that the Business Associate still maintains in any form. This provision shall apply to PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of the Business Associate. The Business Associate shall retain no copies of the PHI.</p>
<p>(3) If the Agreement does not have records management provisions and the Business Associate determines that returning or destroying the PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall provide to the Covered Entity notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the Covered Entity and the Business Associate that return or destruction of PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall extend the protections of the Agreement to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as the Business Associate maintains such PHI.<br />VI. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>(a) Survival. The obligations of Business Associate under the "Effect of Termination" provision of this BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the Agreement shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that permits the Covered Entity and the Business Associate to comply with the HIPAA Rules and the DoD HIPAA Rules.</p>
<p>TOBACCO FREE MEDICAL CAMPUS (TFMC)</p>
