<DESC><p>Additional Questions/Answers - &lsquo;draft' Request For Proposal (RFP) <br />FA8900-09-R-0002
<p>Q. 1. Will the government provide additional Labor Categories for specialized positions (i.e. cardiologist, neurologist)?<br />ANSWER #1: The two labor categories you cite have been included in the list of Labor Categories. Yes, we added in cardiologist and neurologist.</p>
<p>Q. 2. Will the government provide subcategory breakouts (i.e., Senior, Journeyman, Junior) within appropriate labor categories?<br />ANSWER #2: No. We have levels I, II up to IV in some cases. Further subdivisions are not anticipated.</p>
<p>Q. 3. (a) "Will the government provide specific mandatory certification, experience and/or current requirements for labor categories?" Current in this case refers to how current does an individual's experience have to be in order to qualify for the position. Let's take a "Pulmonologist" or Physician III as an example. (b) Will the government require relevant experience within the last 3 years, or can a Doctor (still licensed) have been retired for the last ten years, but still be bid in response to a task order? <br />ANSWER #3: (a) All labor categories include descriptions and required certifications. Additional certifications are specified at the task order level. (b) For past performance criteria the government will require relevant experience for the past three (3) years at the basic award level as well as at the task order level. (see Volume III, Past Performance 5.0 through 5.7 of Section L and Factor 3.0, Factor 2, entitled Past Performance of Section M.</p>
<p>Q. 4. Will you consider a formal SBA approved joint venture between and 8(a) company and other companies a valid entity to bid for this solicitation?<br />ANSWER #4: Yes, SBA must approve joint venture prior to award of any contract.</p>
<p>Q. 5. Will you consider an informal joint venture between and 8(a) company and other companies a valid entity to bid for this solicitation?<br />ANSWER #5: Yes, Title 13, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 125, Section 125.6, paragraph (h)(i), (13CFR 125.6(h)(i)) allows for the cooperative efforts of joint venture (formal or informal) in meeting the requirements of FAR 52.219-14. An informal joint venture would be the typical prime-subcontractor relationship which has a teaming agreement between the two submitted with the proposal. At a minimum, the teaming agreement shall include: official names of parties to the joint venture and their respective signatures; statement as to whether the joint venture is formal or informal; purpose of the agreement; and the effective dates/performance period for the agreement. The prime may only utilize their first tier small business subcontractors to help them met the requirements of FAR 52.219-.14.</p>
<p>Q. 6. As this is a 8(a) set aside competitive solicitation, would you please verify that the 8(a) firm or formal SBA approved 8(a) joint venture will be required to perform at least 51% of the work?<br />ANSWER #6: FAR 52.219.14, Limitations of Subcontracting, states that under a Services contract, at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. Title 13, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 125, Section 125.6, paragraph (h)(i),(13CFR 125.6(h)(i)) allows for the cooperative efforts of joint venture (formal or informal) in meeting the requirements of FAR 52.219-14. An informal joint venture would be the typical prime-subcontractor relationship which has a teaming agreement between the two submitted with the proposal. At a minimum, the teaming agreement shall include: official names of parties to the joint venture and their respective signatures; statement as to whether the joint venture is formal or informal; purpose of the agreement; and the effective dates/performance period for the agreement. The prime may only utilize their first tier small business subcontractors to help them met the requirements of FAR 52.219-.14.</p>
<p>Q. 7. We recently were informed by the staff of the Aeronautical Systems Center that CAPS II at WPAFB will include the labor categories needed to support the 711th HPW. We have been told by AFRL that the 711th HPW A&amp;AS solicitation covers a five year period of performance. Is the government's intent to only consider transition of the 711th A&amp;AS work to CAPS II after the five year POP or could you switch to CAPS II in September 2011 when the contract support for the 711th A&amp;AS work at Brooks transitions to WPAFB? What issues do you anticipate in program continuity created by having a team mate on the executing contract be aligned with a competing CAPS II team?. Would this not create a significant amount of non-productive firewalling so that what is occurring during execution of the 711th HPW A&amp;AS contract doesn't leak across and create OCI issues for those bidding this same work under CAPS II?<br />ANSWER #7: Our intent is to use the entire 5-year period of performance on these basic contracts. We cannot know what the people in charge will decide to do in 2011, nor do we have any insight into the CAPS II effort.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to issue a Request for Quotation for a firm fixed-price purchase order for Mesh Refinement and Calibration of HydroGeoSphere Sacramento Valley Model. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541620 and the related small business size standard is $7.0 Million.  This is an unrestricted solicitation and all offers from responsible concerns will be considered.
Solicitation 09SQ200181 will be posted to http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about April 27, 2009. The date for receipt of proposals will be approximately May 5, 2009. The solicitation must be downloaded at the above website; no paper copy of this solicitation will be distributed. Prospective contractors MUST be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov to be eligible for award. Questions concerning this solicitation should be directed to bmahoney@mp.usbr.gov. 
A description of the work to be performed follows:  
Calibration of the integrated surface/subsurface hydrologic model of the Sacramento Valley using the in-house HydroGeoSphere (HGS) numerical model is required to enhance the model's utility for analyses of surface and subsurface water interactions and hence impacts of groundwater pumping on surface water.
Task 1: Re-generation of Finite-Element Mesh
Subtask 1.1. The Government will provide to the Contractor a DEM with the HGS Sacramento Valley model domain.  The Contractor shall import the DEM into a GIS-based tool, such as ArcHydro, to generate a stream network. The Contractor shall evaluate inconsistencies between the DEM generated stream networks and those resulting from the topography driven stream networks resulting from the HGS Sacramento Valley model files. The Contractor shall resolve inconsistencies using areal information from other sources (e.g., Google Earth). The Contractor shall modify the DEM with the GIS-based tool to ensure that well-defined, correctly placed streams result from the model topography.  
Subtask 1.2. The Contractor shall import the processed DEM in Grid Builder to generate a 2-D land surface mesh with sufficient refinement along the stream paths defined by the DEM to represent the stream network. The Contractor shall interpolate the elevations from the processed DEM onto the created mesh.
Subtask 1.3. The Contractor shall import the mesh elevations into a GIS-based tool (e.g., ArcHydro) and check for consistency of flow paths. If necessary, the Contractor shall re-process mesh elevations to remove local sinks that may reappear due to interpolation.
Subtask 1.4. The Contractor shall use the new 2-D mesh to create a three dimensional mesh that includes the subsurface grid layering with appropriate layer thicknesses as needed by the model. The Contractor shall populate the new mesh with surface and subsurface properties. The Contractor shall perform initial simulation of overland flow to check for consistency with the actual stream network determined by areal sources.
Task 2: Adjustment of Numerical Parameters to Reduce Run TimeThe Contractor shall adjust numerical parameters to reduce the model run time such that a 15-year simulation and all additional work can be completed within the stated performance period.
Task 3: Parameterization and Sensitivity Analysis:In this task, the Contractor shall: (a) determine the appropriate surface/subsurface flow parameters to be considered in the calibration process; (b) perform sensitivity analyses on the appropriate model parameters to determine the parameters most suitable for calibration.  
Task 4: Linkage of PEST and HGS:The Contractor shall prepare all input and output file templates needed for automated calibration of the HGS model using Parameter Estimation (PEST).  
Task 5: Linked PEST-HGS Calibration Runs:Based on the results of Task 1 and using the input and output file templates from Task 2, the Contractor shall perform the calibration runs.  
Task 6: Analysis and Documentation of Results:The Contractor shall write a report documenting and analyzing the results from the calibration runs of Task 3.  This shall include presentation of which parameter values were changed and the associated improvement in agreement with the observed data.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration, Central Service Area, will be awarding a single source contract to Johnson Controls, Inc., 9850 Legler Road, Lenexa, Kansas.
This project is to complete the Johnson Controls Metasys Upgrade of the Building Automation System (BAS) at the Air Route Traffic Control Center, Olathe, Kansas.  
The work includes but is not limited to the following:
1.	Replace all "backplane" controllers with N2 ASC/DS devices or NEXT GEN FEC controllers.2.	Flash NCM4510's furnished under previous upgrade project to NAE's.3.	Replace workstations not previously replaced in the first upgrade project with contemporary pc's loaded with MS Explorer Web Brower software and running EA platform.4.	Install new server for archiving events on EA platform.5.	Generate new graphic for EA platforms.6.	Upgrade IFC 2020 to IFC 3030.7.	Extend an additional network connection from existing hub at NC-6 to second floor of administration wing.  Provide a laptop running on EA platform tied to Metasys network.  Coordinate location of new office with the COTR.
Rationale for the single source:
The BAS is critical to maintaining the ZKC ARTCC building environment within operating parameters for critical National Airspace System (NAS) equipment and personnel.  A failure within the BAS could cause a failure in required NAS equipment, thus negatively affecting Air Traffic Operations.  This procurement will complete the upgrade of the AS to an acceptable level to maintain reliable BAS operations.
Since the ZKC BAS is constructed of JCI-proprietary equipment and software, only JCI can upgrade existing system components and software.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the continuation ofContract NAS5-03131 with the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) for the In-SituMeasurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT) Investigation on the SolarTerrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) Mission.  The UCB is currently performing boththe flight operations, which includes spacecraft mission planning, scheduling, andengineering parameter review and trending, as well as the science operations whichincludes initiating all commands to the instrument, planning all instrument modes andturn-ons, data dissemination to the co-investigators and to the general scientificcommunity.  NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to the UCB.  Theestimated period of performance of this cost-no-fee (CNF) contract extension will be for32 months from February 1, 2010 through September 30, 2012.  The UCB is the onlyorganization currently qualified to perform the subject requirement for the followingreasons:  1) This procurement will enable the science and flight operations activities tobe merged and carried out at UCB with a substantial university undergraduate and graduatestudent educational involvement.  Only UCB possesses the high level scientific expertise,the detailed knowledge of the IMPACT instrument and STEREO spacecraft, the capability tocarry out the operations in a manner in which the scientific operations and the flightoperations can be merged.  2) UCB scientists and engineers are unique in theirfamiliarity with the IMPACT instruments and STEREO spacecraft and the flight computersoftware systems.  From 2000-2006, UCB designed, fabricated, calibrated, tested, andintegrated the science instruments and flight computers on the IMPACT instrument for theSTEREO spacecraft.  Under contract NAS5-03131, UCB has successfully carried out thescience operations of the IMPACT instrument on the STEREO spacecraft since their launchin October 2006.  The UCB developed software for:  testing the instruments on-orbit,generating commands to operate the instruments, checking telemetry received for healthand safety of the instruments, processing the raw data so that scientists can manipulate,display, and analyze the scientific data received, and producing summary data.	Thiseffort requires the detailed understanding of the instruments and flight computer and allrelated software.  Since no other organization was involved with these activities on anin-depth level, no other organization currently has the knowledge and experience toperform the requirement.  3) UCB scientists have helped lead the effort in the communityto analyze the energetic particles and fields data from the STEREO spacecraft, and arecurrently the only organization with the capability to carry out the combined scientificand instrument operations in conjunction with the educational opportunities.  Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only OneResponsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these serviceswithout any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work, shouldfully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of thissynopsis.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon May 12, 2009.

<DESC>Introduction
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of AIDS, has a requirement for scientific, technical and operational support to enable the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities as sponsor of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) and to assist NIAID/DAIDS staff in arranging provisions of investigational drug and vaccine products for clinical trials by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.  

Description 
The mission of DAIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health (NIH), is to bring an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of HIV, supporting the advancement of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of HIV/AIDS vaccines and other prevention measures.  This mission is carried out by four major programs within the Division: the Basic Sciences Program, the Therapeutics Research Program, the Vaccine Research Program and the Prevention Sciences Program.  In conjunction with these programs and through a variety of grants and contracts, NIAID/DAIDS sponsors Phase I, II, III and IV clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutics, vaccines and other preventive modalities.  NIAID/DAIDS currently funds more than 300 clinical trials in over 50 countries at more than 1,000 domestic and international clinical research sites. Since its inception in 1987, NIAID/DAIDS has designed, developed and sponsored extramural Clinical Trials Networks, supported investigator-initiated clinical trials, and partnered with other Government and private organizations to assist in carrying out the Division’s scientific objectives.

As the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug Application (IND) sponsor for a large number of NIAID/DAIDS-supported clinical trials, there is an established requirement for NIAID/DAIDS to provide regulatory support for these clinical trials to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, including Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 50, 54, 56 and 312, and Title 45 CFR Part 46.  Clinical trials must also be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines:  E2A Clinical Safety Data Management and E6 Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and country specific regulatory requirements.  In order to provide regulatory support services for NIAID/DAIDS clinical trials, a seven-year contract was awarded on October 3, 1995 to Social and Scientific Systems, Inc. to operate the Clinical and Regulatory Operations Center (CROC); the center’s name was eventually shortened to the Regulatory Operations Center (ROC).  Subsequently, a recompetition of that contract resulted in the award of a 7-year contract to Technical Resources International, Inc. (TRI) on July 1, 2003 (Contract No. N01-AI-30032) under which NIAID/DAIDS regulatory support services are currently being provided.  Over the past six years, TRI has operated the Regulatory Compliance Center (RCC) to provide regulatory support services to over 1,000 clinical research sites in over 50 countries, with approximately half of the sites located in the United States and the remaining sites located in developing countries with a high incidence of HIV/AIDS.  The purpose of this contract is to continue and expand clinical regulatory and technical support services for NIAID/DAIDS-supported clinical trials. 

Interested offerors should have the following capabilities:

Appropriate and adequate organizational experience, proposed plans and procedures, available personnel, and understanding of problems and deficiencies for the following clinical regulatory support functions:

2) Paralegal and administrative support for the preparation, negotiation and finalization of Clinical Trial Agreements (CTAs) and other research agreements.

3) Technical and administrative support for the review of concept proposals and protocols by NIAID/DAIDS Scientific Review Committees (SRCs).

4) Human Subjects Protection (HSP) support, including: maintenance of informed consent (IC) templates; regulatory review of protocol sample informed consents (SICs) and their translations; planning and conduct of training on IC issues.

5) Technical and administrative support for the preparation, tracking and distribution of IND submissions and other regulatory filings, including: preparation, distribution and tracking of initial and subsequent IND submissions; preparation of annual IND reports; regulatory review and tracking of new and amended IND protocols; maintenance of IND and related regulatory files and information systems.

6) Establishment, operation and maintenance of the RSC Protocol Registration Office (PRO) to: review and track required clinical site regulatory documents for all protocol versions at each clinical research site; plan and conduct training on protocol registration procedures and related issues; maintain protocol registration information systems.

7) Establishment, operation and maintenance of the RSC Safety Office for: receipt, evaluation, processing and triage of Adverse Experience Safety Reports; preparation of interim and final FDA IND Safety Reports and other required reports; assist in the preparation of training materials and in the conduct of training sessions on safety oversight and reporting requirements for clinical site personnel. 

8) Operation, maintenance and updating of RSC related data management information systems and a government labeled RSC website.

9) Development and implementation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for multiple supporting functions including maintenance of clinical trials master files, FDA reporting, safety reporting, protocol registration and overall quality management of the contract.

10) Other regulatory support, including: Assistance in preparing responses to special requests from government and non-government entities; Responding to queries regarding safety reporting, protocol registration, and informed consent issues from clinical research sites, staff of HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Network Coordinating and Operations Centers (CORES) and/or Network Operations Centers, and Network Evaluation Committees. 

11) Appropriate and adequate staffing with the education, training, experience, expertise, qualifications and effort of clinical and technical personnel, including experience and expertise in supporting large, complex clinical trials networks/programs involving both domestic and international clinical research sites.

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, level of effort type contract will be awarded for a 1-year period of performance beginning on or about April 1, 2010 with one year options to extend the period an additional six years.  In addition, an option may be exercised in year 3 for additional effort to provide for the electronic submission of IND documents when such requirements are implemented by the FDA.  Also, the Government may exercise an option in any year of the contract to increase the safety staffing to provide for 24/7 coverage of the RSC Safety Office and to provide for an increase in work volume due to a change in MedWatch reporting from 30 calendar days to 15 calendar days for non-IND studies. 

It is anticipated that a level of effort type contract will be awarded. The performance requirement will be the delivery of 54.25 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the base period (Year 1) and 54.25 FTEs for the option periods (Years 2 through 7).  In addition, if the Government exercises the option for electronic submission of IND documents to the FDA, the performance requirement will be the delivery of 4.80 FTEs/year for option periods 3 through 7.

<DESC>Responses to this Broad Agency Announcement are sought to develop and test a dual pulse rocket motor and develop and test a Thrust Vector Control (TVC) mechanism compatible with the rocket motor, for use in future  Navy anti-air missiles. NAICS Code 541712 and 1,000 No. of employees will be used for this effort. The development of the dual pulse rocket motor will be in an existing steel rocket motor case with a 10" to 15" diameter.  The TVC and its associated Thrust Vector Actuation (TVA) system must be highly space efficient, so as to be compatible with existing missiles with tail control servo mechanisms packaged around the rocket motor nozzle. TVC/TVA components must be capable of withstanding temperatures and exhaust gas products associated with highly aluminized propellant for the duration of dual pulse rocket motor operation.  Exposure conditions of TVC/TVA components will vary depending upon configurations developed, and could consist of direct gas impingement and/or indirect heat transfer.  Impingement and heat soak-out conditions into TVC/TVA components will be contingent upon motor operating conditions, nozzle/TVC configurations and interpulse delay times selected.  Manufacturing and cost are other areas of interest for this BAA.  The rocket motor must be capable of storage, transportation and operation over normal military weapon temperature ranges.  Additionally, the rocket motor must be capable of meeting!  standard Navy lifecycle, ignition system, and Insensitive Munitions (IM) safety requirements.  If the rocket motor cannot meet IM requirements, it must be capable of providing substantive improvements in IM performance over similar rocket motors of the same class that are currently fielded.  Manufacturers capable of producing dual pulse rocket motors and TVC/TVA systems are invited to submit white papers for the design of a rocket motor and suitable TVC/TVA system, fabrication of test articles, and the conductance of a test program, culminating in a flight-ready design and hardware built to that design that demonstrates technology applicable to high performance future Navy anti-air missiles.  It is envisioned that this will be a multi phase program.  Phase 1 will be a study phase to generate a dual pulse rocket motor design and a compatible TVC/TVA design.  Phase 2 will be a subsystem development phase where the rocket motor will be fabricated and tested (static fired), an! d the TVC/TVA system will also be fabricated and tested (bench tested).  This phase may include testing of prototype, non-form-factored hardware, not representative of a full tactical design, but shall also include demonstration of form-factored critical components.  Phase 3 will consist of integrating the developed TVC/TVA system to the dual pulse rocket motor and conducting hot-fire and environmental tests in representative operating environments.  Phase 4 will consist of integrating and conducting ground tests (hot-fire, environmental and IM testing) of flight quality hardware.  
Offerors whose white papers are selected will be invited to submit full proposals.  More detailed requirements, including A SECRET classified addendum to this BAA will be provided to qualified offerors providing more detail on the rocket motor and TVC performance requirements. In addition, offerors shall have, or have the ability to acquire, the capability to hold and use TOP SECRET material.
Proposal topic areas of specific interest in this BAA must include but are not limited to the following:  1. Dual Pulse Rocket Motor Improvements: The objectives of this area are to provide a practical manufacturing approach, the desired first pulse thrust and total impulse, second pulse thrust and total impulse, pulse barrier deployment, interpulse time delay range, first and second pulse ignition characteristics, and robust performance characteristics in standard Navy applications.  The rocket motor must have repeatable, well characterized performance and acoustic behavior over a wide temperature range.  The rocket motor shall meet all standard Navy safety requirements, including lifecycle and ignition systems safety requirements.  The rocket motor shall be no more sensitive than a DOT Class 1.3 item and shall make substantive improvements over currently fielded rocket motors in the area of IM response.
2. Thrust Vector Control Mechanism Improvements:  The objectives of this area are to provide reliable and predictable TVC/TVA performance under the operating conditions of the selected motor design, with very compact packaging.  The ideal TVC/TVA and supporting power system will be capable of being integrated into an existing baseline missile system with no structural, thermal, mechanical or electrical impact to existing tail control fin and servo assemblies, and be capable of providing not less than 5 degrees of thrust vectoring in any combined pitch/yaw plane for the duration of firing both rocket motor pulses.  Offerors shall provide predicted TVC/TVA characteristics, including: thrust vector slew rates, actuator bandwidth, and thrust vector alignment.   The materials used in the TVC/TVA system should have repeatable, well characterized performance over a very wide temperature range and be chosen to minimize cost.  There should be a practical approach to manufacturing the!  TVC and TVA units and integrating them into the nozzle assembly.  The developed TVC/TVA system shall be capable of being integrated into a missile guidance and control loop and shall have an integral power source capable of supporting full-mission TVC/TVA operation.
3. Rocket Motor Testing:  The objectives of this area are to validate predicted performance, including with regard to thrust/time curves, chamber pressures, exhaust temperatures, combustion products, ignition response times and successful barrier deployment, as appropriate.  Additionally, testing will validate environmental robustness and safety compliance of the rocket motor and its components to Navy requirements.
4. TVC Testing:  The objectives of this area are to validate predicted performance, verify material behavior of the TVC/TVA design, evaluate operation (thermostructural, erosion, and control performance) throughout the duration of both pulses, and assess thrust vectoring performance (vector angle, slew rate, vector alignment accuracy, etc.).

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Alaska Science Center, has a need for a vessel charter for support of Walrus Radio-Tagging in the southern Chukchi Sea.  The vessel will be chartered for approximately 10 to 18 days beginning on or about June 7, 2009.  The vessel will provide transportation and support for the science crew of 6 people working for USGS and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS).
The objective of the cruise will be to deploy satellite-linked radio-tags from small workboats on walruses within the sea ice margin.  Two workboats will be provided by USGS for the field work and must be loaded onto the charter vessel from a port with road access near Anchorage, Alaska.  The work area will be the southeastern Chukchi Sea at the southern end of the retreating pack ice.  The vessel will operate within the sea ice margin.  The estimated location of the initial target area will be north of about Point Hope, but is ultimately dependent on sea ice conditions at the time.
Vessel must meet U.S. Coast Guard standards for an "oceanographic research vessel" for safe operations offshore in the Arctic Ocean.  Name, proof of U.S. Coast Guard license, proof of insurance, and a description of the watercraft experience of the Captain.  Captain shall have at least 3 years experience operating watercraft of the size being offered in the following specific regions: ice-bearing waters of the North Pacific or Arctic Oceans.  
A fixed price type contract is contemplated for this requirement.  Competitive procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, will be utilized.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is the best value to the government.  Vessel suitability as determined by a USGS project leader/inspector will be a main factor in selecting the contract vessel.  The Government reserves the right to make award to other than the low offeror.  It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued and posted to this site on or about April 29, 2009 with proposals due on or about May 6, 2009.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  Note: Funding is not yet available for this effort.  However, it is anticipated that funding will be available by May 8, 2009.  This notice and any resulting RFP and/or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-32, effective April 20, 2009.

In July 1995, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission recommended realigning RRAD by moving all maintenance missions associated with the M113 Tactical Vehicle Series to other depot maintenance activities. 765 acres were originally designated for transfer to the Red River Redevelopment Authority (RRRA). The water treatment plant, industrial waste treatment plant, sewer treatment plant and high voltage electrical distribution system were privatized through BRAC in 2001 adding an additional 32 acres. Of the total 797 acres, approximately 104 acres remain to be transferred.

<ARCHDATE>12312009
<CONTACT>Lisandra Torres E-mail Only
<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is issuing this PRESOLICITATION NOTICE to procure prototype combat helmets for evaluation, with the option to field limited quantities of helmets.  The forthcoming solicitation will be issued on the basis of full and open competition.  The NAICS code is 339113, Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing, with a size standard of 500.  This is a Presolicitation Notice only; no proposals are being requested at this time.  Information contained in this notice is subject to change.
MARCORSYSCOM is interested in investigating an Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH), capable of meeting all current combat helmet requirements (i.e., USMC Lightweight Helmet), but exhibiting significantly improved ballistic performance (minimum 35% increase compared to current minimums) against fragmentation, handgun and small arms threats. The specified geometry of these helmets, full PASGT cut, tactical (MICH/ACH) cut, or both - is as yet undecided but will be stated in the solicitation.  Suspension/retention systems will be from approved mandatory sources of supply.  Interested offerors will be limited to two material solutions (maximum of two (2) proposals each) for the ECH based on the current state-of-the-art materials.
Offerors must be able to demonstrate the capability to produce an ECH with the minimum V50s and not exceeding the maximum weights at the time of proposal submission.  One or more product demonstration models (consisting of a complete helmet with the currently approved mandatory source of supply suspension/retention systems) will be required as part of the proposal submittal.  Complete requirements for the written proposal(s) will be set forth in the solicitation, but it is anticipated they will include the following, among others: material composition and lay-up, description of basic manufacturing processes, shell weights and thicknesses, rapid production capabilities and delivery schedule, and ballistic performance.  Ballistic test data required will include V50s for the 2-, 4-, 16-, and 64-grain Right Circular Cylinder (RCC) and the 17 grain Fragment Simulating Projectile (FSP) generated on actual helmets (not flat panels) from an NIJ-approved test lab. 
The Government anticipates making multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract awards.  Awards will consist of initial minimum quantities of up to 50 helmets per size in sizes small, medium, large, and extra large, per material solution proposed (for a potential maximum quantity of 400 per contract (or 200 per solution)).  These helmets will be subjected to a battery of tests to be specified in the solicitation.  If further evaluation is required, the Government may purchase additional prototype quantities above the contract minimum.  These additional line items may consist of one to several hundred helmets per size, but no more than 2,000 each per contract.  Contract awards will also consist of additional option line items for production units, to be exercised based on the results of further evaluation.  The estimated total quantity for production, distributed among one or more potential awardees, is 38,500 each to include spares and tariff adjustments.!   The basis for making the production option exercise decision will be set forth in the solicitation, but the Government anticipates considering the ballistic performance (V50) against fragmentation, handgun and small arms (V50 and V0) in making its determination for production, along with delivery schedule and price.
Evaluation factors will be set forth in the forthcoming solicitation.  Solicitation No. M67854-09-R-3025 is anticipated to be issued within the next sixty (60) days and will be posted on the internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website located at the following address:     http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  The on-line version of the solicitation will include all documents of the solicitation package.  No hard copy of this solicitation will be issued.  Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the original solicitation.  The complete solicitation package, including amendments, should be received and reviewed prior to submitting a response.  The proposal shall be submitted in hard copy form only.  No electronic submission of proposals will be accepted.  Those responding to the solicitation have the responsibility to obtain all amendments and/or other applicable documents.  !  Offerors are instructed to hold all questions until the solicitation has been issued.  Offerors shall submit ALL questions in writing to lisandra.torres@usmc.mil.  No phone calls will be accepted.  All items, materials, and components thereof submitted shall be in full compliance with the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C 2533a).  Offerors may be required to provide detailed information certifying compliance.  In order to be eligible for award, interested parties must be registered into the Central Contractor Database (CCR), http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). The Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) is requesting information concerning the support of a translational research program in surgical treatment.  This research program has multiple functional areas which require software and database support.  The program is evaluating various options to provide this support, namely internal development, best-of-breed products and/or integrated products.  This RFI provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their ideas, initiatives, and/or products related to this request. 

This RFI is subject to the provisions of FAR 52.215-3 and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment to issue an RFP. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to pay for any information, or otherwise reimburse responders for any costs associated with their respective submissions in response to this RFI. Any response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. This RFI is issued for the purpose of understanding the range of products available for support of the described translational research system.  

Any proprietary or source selection information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis. The Government intends to use third party, non-Government (contractor) support personnel as subject matter experts in the review of responses received, including the review of any marked or unmarked proprietary or source selection information provided. Appropriate non-disclosure agreements have been executed between the third party, non-Government (contractor) support personnel and the Government and are on file with the Government. A submission of a response to this RFI constitutes the respondents acknowledgement and agreement that the information provided in the response, including any marked or unmarked proprietary or source selection information, may be disclosed to the these third party, non-Government (contractor) support personnel. 

BACKGROUND

NMRC in collaboration with other military and academic entities is participating in  multi-center clinical trials to advance the state of the art in surgical treatment.  The project's activities involve clinical care, sample biobanking and sophisticated data analysis.  The goal is to accumulate an integrated data set consisting of clinical data, cytokine array data and other analytical results.  This data set will be used to build various models of injury and treatment.  As part of this effort a central repository of frozen samples will be created.  The repository will serve as the material source for multiple laboratories involved in the project.  The projected size of the repository is in the order of hundreds of thousands of frozen samples.  

This project requires software and database support for both management and data collection.

The core requirements are divided into three related functional areas and one support area:  clinical trial management, sample management, laboratory data importation and a common file storage area.

1.  Clinical trial management covers the overall management of patient progress in various trials.  In particular, the requirement includes the manual completion of electronic  Case Report Forms (CRF's) and the uploading of associated image files. .
2.  Sample tracking begins at the moment of sample acquisition and continues until the sample's final destination, whether analysis or long-term storage.  Sample tracking has two components.  The first is the in-house management of the central biorepository of frozen samples.  This requirement comprises all of the activities necessary to run such a repository including sample acceptance, storage allocation, work requests, sample retrieval, sample testing and shipment disbursement.  The second component is the external tracking of sample movement beginning with acquisition prior to storage and concluding with post-storage analysis at any one of several laboratories. 
3.  Laboratory activity necessitates the flexible importation of low-density array data (e.g., between 100 and 200 values per analysis).  The laboratory array data needs to be associated with the source sample and ultimately with the study patient.
4.  There is a separate support requirement of a secure, web-based, commonly accessible, structured  file repository for the posting of study documents.

At a lower priority, the ability to handle the animal analog of the above laboratory process only would be advantageous.  The animal data differs from the human data in that each data set is handled independently.  There is no building of an integrated data set.  Rather, the system needs to track separate data sets per experiment.

The environment of the project imposes a number of systemic requirements:

1.Able to support multiple remote sites.
2.Compliant with applicable military regulations as well as 21 CFR Part 11, HIPPA, FDA, etc. 
3.Adequate external security.
4.Layered and/or role-based internal security.
5.Maintenance of audit trials.
6.Appropriate tools for system configuration and management.


REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Please provide information to assist in answering the following questions:
1.Are there any particular products in the marketplace that can cover multiple core functions adequately which will eliminate or reduce the challenge of system integration?
2.Are there combinations of best-of-breed products which could provide optimum coverage of the requirements yet not incur a substantial effort in system integration?
3.Is there such a difference between integrated products and best-of-breed products that the additional cost of integration is worthwhile?

Responses should be sent in either Microsoft Word or portable document format (pdf). Please provide your response via email to thomas.hood@med.navy.mil no later than May 11,2008 at 11:00 am.

The contract number is ED-07-CO-0062.&nbsp; The purpose of this modification is to produce an additional 10-15 Research Perspectives &amp; Briefs on various topics. The contractor will develop, produce and disseminate a series of What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence reports, to be named Research Perspectives, Research Briefs, and Practice Briefs. Research Perspectives use highly skilled and experienced researchers' perspectives on what research has found will work in addressing pressing educational issues, supported by a WWC review of the research that is cited by these researchers to assess its consistency with WWC evidence standards. Research Briefs are educator-friendly short reports of objective summaries of what research indicates about the effectiveness and implementation challenges of a policy, practice, or issue in education. Briefs draw on rigorous studies that meet WWC standards, as well as correlational studies and case studies, and take a broad view of what is currently known about the policy, practice, or issue being studied.&nbsp; The Briefs also assess the level of research evidence of whether the policy or practice improves outcomes using WWC Practice Guide standards.&nbsp; Practice Briefs provide explicit information on how to implement one practice from a WWC Practice Guide, and will provide educators with research-based, how-to steps and strategies for overcoming roadbloacks, and tools for educators. The contractor will produce 10-15 Research Perspectives under tight time constraints within a period of 13-15 weeks.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCE SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for NAICS 424480.  This is not a solicitation or request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at this time. See attached map. This synopsis is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition (FAR) Part 10.  This Sources Sought Notice is to determine the availability of small business HUB ZONE (certified or non-certified) sources, SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN (SDV),or SMALL DISADVANTAGED (SD) sources who are interested in submitting an offer on a proposed acquisition to provide fresh fruits and vegetables to two (2) military commissary store locations, Hill Air Force Base(AFB) and Dugway Proving Grounds(PG),Utah, assigned to the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).

DeCAs military commissaries are Government-owned facilities designed to operate similar to commercial retail supermarkets.  DeCAs commissaries provide food items and other merchandise for resale to authorized shoppers at a cost savings when compared to the same or similar products sold in commercial retail markets.

DeCA is seeking small business concerns who qualify as HUB Zone (certified or non-certified), (SDV), and (SD)who are capable of meeting the requirements listed below in providing a full line of fresh fruits and vegetable products and potted plants to Hill AFB and Dugway PG.  The proposed NAICS for this acquisition is 424480, which sets the small business threshold at 500 employees.  

WEB-BASED ORDERING SYSTEM:
Contractors must be capable of providing and maintaining a licensed web-based retail ordering system.  The web-based system must have the capability to receive and process orders from the two commissary locations to be supported under any contract that may result from the proposed solicitation, send electronic price updates, create detailed sales and order history reports, and provide inventory management.  The contractor-owned pricing and ordering system must be able to interface with DeCAs existing systems, i.e. allow DeCA personnel to access their system via the Internet without any additional cost or effort to DeCA.  Therefore, all the necessary software, equipment, and/or web page developments and/or enhancements shall be provided at no additional cost to the Government.  

CONTRACTOR FACILITY REQUIREMENTS:
The contractor shall be responsible for providing all necessary licenses, permits, supervision, facilities, equipment, order processing, distribution, inventory management, and personnel at the contractors own facilities/distribution center to receive, store, handle, sort, and deliver all required FF&V items to the various commissary locations that expect to be serviced.  

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
Distribution is a key factor in a successful FF&V program. A successful distribution system relies on two main factors, a large volume of product movement and a sufficient number of well-placed distribution centers. When these two factors are present, customers will receive the freshest products available.  Each consolidation and/or distribution center utilized by the contractor in performance of the resulting contract shall have multiple temperature-controlled areas in order to meet the different recommended temperature requirements for the various products in order to maintain shelf life and ensure the FF&V received at each location is of the freshest and highest quality. The lead-time from order placement to product receipt at the store level for CONUS locations (Continental USA) will not exceed 24 hours.

USDA INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS:
Contractors will be required to work with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspectors to ensure that all products are inspected, received, stored, staged, and shipped in accordance with USDA standards.  

ADDITIONAL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS:

Contractors will be required to provide additional support and promotions to both Hill AFB and Dugway PG.  Additional support includes point of sale material, recipe cards, pamphlets, coupons, seasonal dcor, and/or other material that is often available from produce commissions.  Additional support also includes value added services that are designed to enhance the overall produce program and increase customer satisfaction through a well-merchandised produce department.  Further, additional support includes weekly merchandising visits to each commissary store location, and periodic merchandising support during promotions, resets, and/or grand opening events that provide show-stopping merchandising techniques and SUPER sale priced items.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:

Interested sources are required to respond to this sources sought synopsis by submitting a capabilities package to the contracting office NOT LATER THAN MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009.  The capabilities package should include:

DTRA seeks Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) to provide oversight of exercises/demonstrations of an end-to-end Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI) capability.  These demonstrations will encompass the identification and characterization of an unknown pathogen through the testing of the effectiveness of the newly-developed countermeasure.   This effort will initiate a series of exercises/demonstrations that will not only exercise the conceptual and functional components of the program, but will also elucidate areas that need strategic or targeted investment as this capability matures.

Exercises/demonstrations will test the effectiveness and timing of different TMTI elements, to include the:

-Rapid identification and characterization of the unknown;
-In-depth assessment of candidate countermeasure targets;
-Production of countermeasure using nucleic acid technology;
-Assessment of countermeasure effectiveness and
-Communication between and oversight of exercise elements.

Exercises/demonstrations will be based on the actual movement of live samples and use of specialized laboratory facilities at disparate locations.  It is anticipated that several partner organizations will be involved, such as FDA, OSDHA and OTSG, with more being identified as the scenario is developed.

Preparative aspects of the work will include:

-Overall planning, coordination and execution of multiple exercises/demonstrations;
-Establishment of memorandums of understanding;
-Scenario and metric development;
-Work process and communication plan outlined and documented;
-Production or acquisition of material needed for exercises/demonstrations, and

<DESC>DESC invites expressions of interest from other potential offerors. Any firms desiring consideration must fully identify, in writing, their capabilities to deliver diesel and jet fuels from algal oils by the contract start date of June 1, 2009. Expressions of interest are due by May 1, 2009. 

The Defense Energy Support Center is exploring the method of using applied research and development to convert algal oils into diesel and jet fuels. This is the proprietary process of Solazyme to produce crude oil from a variety of domestically grown plant feedstocks (including various molecular sugars,  including cellulosics and organic waste streams) through the medium of algae that can be further refined into military grade diesel and jet fuel.  The production will support the Navy’s requirements for their certification program for F-76 fuel derived from oil produced by algae grown using a heterotrophic process.  The outcome of this project is to facilitate the increased production capacity of domestically produced renewable biofuels.

Under the authority of FAR 6.302, this requirement has been identified for non-competitive contract action.  Solazyme is identified as the only source capable of converting algal oils into diesel and jet fuels from a variety of domestically grown plant feedstocks.  It is DESC’s intent to enter into a contractual arrangement with Solazyme.

DESC invites expressions of interest from other potential offerors. Any firms desiring consideration must fully identify, in writing, their capabilities to deliver diesel and jet fuels from algal oils by the contract start date of June 1, 2009. Expressions of interest are due by May 1, 2009.

Complete a ranking system for non-native (invasive) terrestrial and aquatic animals and invertebrate species (not plants).  This means a complete review of the invasive species plans of other organizations and relevant literature, a biography and risk assessment for each species identified for ranking, and a ranking system placed in linked tabular form appropriate for a website.  Provide a clear report documenting the methods and results on an invasive species ranking.  Present draft report and findings to Forest Service employees and edit draft report as necessary to deliver a final report.  Format of final report (e.g., pdf) and tabular website (e.g., html) negotiable, but delivered on electronic media suitable for the internet.  Timeline: Begin ASAP, Finish (negotiable) December 31, 2008.


General Methods

•	Update list of non-native or invasive species on National Forest System Lands in Alaska.  Conduct a thorough literature review of non-native species that occur on or adjacent to National Forest lands in Alaska using published and unpublished sources, and if necessary, update the pre-existing list compiled by Schrader and Hennon (2005).
•	Develop ranking criteria.  Review literature of existing invasiveness ranking systems (both published and gray literature) for animals, with a focus on potential for introduction, establishment, damage, and control
•	Develop invasiveness ranking criteria:  Based on the results of the literature review, develop a set of invasiveness ranking criteria.  The final ranking criteria and system will be decided upon based on agreement between the FS and contractor staff.
•	Synthesize information for select species to be ranked.  Summarize information from the literature and other existing sources on the biology, modes of dispersal, documented impacts, control options, and distribution of species to be ranked
•	Rank all known invasive animal species on National Forest Lands in Alaska.  From the up-dated list of non-native animals, populate the ranking system for individual species using the synthesis of information described above.
•	Develop a linked tabular output similar to current invasive plants website

Specific deliverables
•	the report - Summarize the results of the ranking system in a final report which will contain detailed information in the development of the ranking system, a summary of the final ranks, and individual species ranking templates with associated documentation used to calculate the rank
•	the ranking system (detailing the elements and scoring of ranking factors), species biographies, species risk assessments
•	the display in tabular form for each species (similar to the previously completed invasive plant ranking project)
•	the linked tabular output - ranking, biography, and risk assessment .

<DESC>Continuous, Non-Invasive Monitoring of Blood Pressure – Request for information

Sponsor: Dr. Deepak Varshneya, Strategic Technology Office (STO), DARPA 

This request for information is to identify technical experts and concepts that will help DARPA ascertain the feasibility of pursuing a program to develop the capability to perform the continuous, non-invasive monitoring of blood pressure for battlefield triage and casualty transport.  To identify these experts/concepts, DARPA is requesting the submission of abstracts in response to the discussion below.  Depending on the quality and the scope of the abstracts received, DARPA may choose to hold a workshop to further assess the feasibility and value of developing a DARPA program.  

The need for non-invasive and continuous monitoring of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) is pervasive across all medical environments, but most especially on military battlefield where rapid triage, stabilization and evacuation are critical to the survival of the wounded. Unfortunately, truly continuous monitoring of BP can only be done invasively, a procedure that is difficult to accomplish on the front lines. “Semi-continuous” approaches rely on automatic measurements using a cuff, which are difficult or, depending on the wound, sometimes impossible to use in the battlefield environment. Existing non-invasive approaches also often interfere with other critical medical procedures. Thus, there is an urgent medical need for continuous monitoring of BP that is non-invasive and flexible enough to be implemented regardless of the injury. 

Although such a capability does not exist, the increased emphasis in home health care has led to a large body of research and many fielded devices focused on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, which begins to address the needs on the battlefield. The most “non-invasive” devices (e.g., BMEYE, Portapres®, etc.) use finger cuffs coupled with sophisticated algorithms to account for motion and other factors that interfere with the measurement. There is also a body of research using devices based on photo-plethysmographic like sensors that measure the pressure pulse as it moves from one location to another through changes in diameter of the blood vessels. (for example, see “Mobile Monitoring with Wearable Photo-plethysmographic Biosensors,” EEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine May/June 2003 H. Harry Asada, Phillip Shaltis, Andrew Reisner, Sokwoo Rhee, and Reginald C. Hutchinson).

However, the devices and research described above fall short of the Warfighter’s needs on the battlefield in several important ways. First, these devices will generally require measurements to be made on the finger where cuffs are non-obtrusive and optical measurements can be easily made. Unfortunately, in the battlefield environment, one cannot assume access to any particular part of the body. In addition, each of these approaches requires calibration and/or a careful medical attention (e.g., correctly sized finger cuff) to ensure accurate measurements. Again, such luxuries are not necessarily available to the medic in the battlefield. Thus, while these efforts provide optimism that this difficult problem may be tractable, DARPA believes that more fundamental, multidisciplinary effort is required.  Clearly, a key to solving this problem is to develop a detailed understanding of the physiological signatures associated with blood flowing through the body and to relate those signatures to an absolute pressure or mean arterial pressure (MAP). For example, the dynamic measurement of blood flow rate combined with knowing the temporal changes in blood vessel dimensions could allow calculations of pressure using fluid dynamic models. Making these measurements might require optical imaging and developing mechanical models of arterial wall dynamics. 

It is likely many other signatures and associated sensors could be uncovered if interdisciplinary teams with the following disciplines/technical expertise were brought to bear. 
•	Medical experience on the military battlefield and/or civilian emergency and hospital setting.
•	Understanding and modeling of the possible signatures from all modalities (optical, acoustic, RF, mechanical, etc.) that may be relatable to blood pressure.
•	Expertise in developing sensors that can measure signatures from across the complete spectrum of modalities.
•	Experience in implementing medical devices and measurements. 
•	Mathematics and signal processing.

The purpose of this RFI it to identify technologies from across multiple disciplines to identify areas that would be promising to pursue in a possible DARPA program to develop a continuous, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring system. 

Abstract Submission:
DARPA  requests a one-page abstract that highlights the experience and/or expertise that the submitter feels can contribute to the problem of continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring. Abstracts should be related to one or more of the disciplines/expertise described above. Abstracts that do not address the focus of this RFI and/or lack technical content will be reviewed. Because of the possibility that abstracts will be presented in an open forum, they should not include proprietary information.  Abstracts may be by multiple authors, but a primary author must be identified.  To be considered, abstracts must be submitted by 15 May 2009 to the following email address:  CNIMBP@darpa.mil.  Additional information can be found on the following web site www.sa-meetings.com/CNIMBP2009.

Workshop
Based on the quality and scope of the abstracts received, DARPA may choose to hold a workshop to provide an opportunity for the interdisciplinary community to interact with DARPA and other interested DOD agencies.  This workshop will be by invitation only  - with invitations based primarily on the relevance of the technologies in the the submitted abstracts.  Some of those invited may be asked to provide a short presentation based on their abstract.  In the case of oversubscription, invitations may be limited to the primary author of an abstract.  No proprietary information should be presented at this workshop.  Information about how to follow-up to DARPA with proprietary information will be presented during the workshop.

For planning purposes, a tentative date of 23-25 June 2009 in San Diego is being held in anticipation of holding the workshop.  However, DARPA has not yet committed to this workshop and reserves the right to not hold any workshop or change its date and/or location.  Response to the RFI is strictly voluntary.  This RFI does not commit DARPA to be responsible for any cost associated in the generation of the abstracts or any subsequent costs associated with any attendance at the workshop by any individuals.  This RFI does not commit DARPA in any way to the development of a program in this area.

<SOLNBR>
<ARCHDATE>06302009

<a href="mailto:Michael.Raizen@hq.doe.gov">Michael Raizen, Contract Officer</a>
<DESC>Funding Opportunity Announcement No. DE-FOA-0000065This is the first solicitation for the Advanced Research Projects Agency  Energy (ARPA-E).  ARPA-E is a new organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), created specifically to foster research and development (R&D) of transformational energy-related technologies.  Transformational technologies are by definition technologies that disrupt the status quo.  They are not merely better than current technologies, they are significantly better. Often, a technology is considered transformational when it so outperforms current approaches that it causes an industry to shift its technology base to the new technology.  The Nation needs transformational energy-related technologies to overcome the threats posed by climate change and energy security, arising from its reliance on traditional uses of fossil fuels and the dominant use of oil in transportation. ARPA-E will fund scientists and technologists to take an immature technology that promises to make a large impact on the ARPA-E Mission Areas and develop it beyond the valley of death that prevents many transformational new technologies from becoming a market reality.  The valley of death generally occurs in two phases.  The first phase occurs at the point of determining whether a laboratory stage technology can ever become a real-world technology or it has some inherent unsuitability for real-world applications.  Once it has been determined through R&D that the apparent barriers can be overcome and how they may be overcome, then additional investment from many other sources causes a new field of technology options to open up.  The second phase of the valley of death occurs at the point of developing the immature transformational technology to the point where key risks have been lowered enough that industry can invest in the final stages of development and incorporate the technology into products. Success for ARPA-E as an organization will be gauged by (a) whether its portfolio of investments includes the most promising transformational energy technology options and (b) the agencys ability to form and manage R&D efforts to mature these technologies rapidly.  In the end, the nation will judge ARPA-E on whether these technologies come to market and are being used widely enough that they make a significant difference to reductions in domestic oil use and energy-related emissions of greenhouse gases.To accomplish these challenging goals, ARPA-E is willing to work with any R&D entity singly or in teams, that has a transformational technology idea and a credible plan to mature that technology beyond either phase of the valley of death.  For early stage transformational technologies with the potential for broad transformational impact, the R&D project must carry the technology development to the point where others can recognize the major potential impact and the technology is suitable for development or can be made suitable. For the projects aimed at overcoming the later phase of the valley of death, the technology (component, system, hardware, software, or other) must be matured to the point that it can transition into industrial development and deployment. The kinds of technologies most suited to an ARPA-E style development are those that still have significant technical risks to overcome, but promise to meet the future costs and scale of products that can deeply penetrate into consumer and industrial use.  ARPA-E intends to accelerate the development of these technologies and, in many cases, make possible transformational technologies that would normally not be able to reach enough maturity for industry to use them because of the risks at the current stage of development. ARPA-E intends to be a nimble, flat organization that is willing to take on high-risk projects to meet its ambitious goals.  Working with the performer, ARPA-E will create an intellectual property strategy, technical data strategy, and procurement or financial assistance instrument that best manages the high risk inherent in this kind of R&D and optimizes the likelihood that the technology will move forward to market after the Government ceases funding. ARPA-E has the flexibilities to work with companies who do not traditionally work with the Federal Government.  In the area of cost-sharing, ARPA-E will be flexible, working with the performer to determine the appropriate level and the appropriate type of cost-sharing arrangements, which may include monetary contributions and/or other (in-kind) contributions.  As rules of thumb, when the project risk is very high, the cost sharing should be lower.  When the technology is closer to market or the future market is large and potentially very profitable, the cost share should be higher. Once the R&D project begins, ARPA-E Program Managers will interact frequently with performers, helping to identify problems as early as possible and seeking solutions to keep the R&D on track.  ARPA-Es role is more than simply providing R&D funds; ARPA-E will actively work to make your R&D succeed.This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, will focus on high-risk, high-payoff transformational energy-related R&D.  In this announcement, ARPA-E asks for the kernel of your technical idea in the form of a concept paper.  ARPA-E will respond to you, indicating whether a full application based on that idea is likely to receive funding.  We do this first step to save you the time and expense of preparing a full application that may have little chance of success.  Please read carefully about the ARPA-E mission and decide if your R&D plan really satisfies these goals.  Only truly transformational technologies that can contribute greatly to the ARPA-Es Mission Areas have any chance of funding.  We are not looking for incremental progress on current technologies. If you have a technical idea that can change the energy landscape and are looking to work with ARPA-E to move that technology beyond the technical risk barriers preventing its current use, read further.This initial announcement is narrowly focused on transformational R&D, but intentionally broad on applications and technologies.  This announcement is open to the full range of concepts potentially covering all aspects of ARPA-Es Mission Areas.  The intent is to harness the creativity of all sectors of the American science and technology communities to advance the ARPA-E Mission Areas and stimulate the pursuit of new and innovative technical opportunities that can spur great leaps forward within those mission impact areas. Concept PaperIn order to reduce the administrative burden on applicants and ARPA-E, and to mitigate unnecessary costs associated with the generation of applications that are unlikely to receive funding and expedite awards, ARPA-E applicants are required to submit a concept paper as the first step of the application process.  ARPA-E will review the concept paper and provide early feedback on whether the kernel of the R&D idea is likely to form a basis of a successful full application.  Only after notification from ARPA-E on the concept paper will the applicant be permitted to submit a full application. Opening time for submission of concept papers begins May 12, 2009.  The Concept Paper closing date and time is on 2 June 2009 at 8:00 p.m. (EST).  Concept papers must be submitted to www.FedConnect.net at any time between the opening time and the closing time for concept paper submission.  Early submission is strongly encouraged.This FOA will appear both on the FedConnect website stated above and on http://grants.gov/.  Mr. Bradley Poston at Bradley.Poston@hq.doe.gov is the Grants Officer.

<DESC>This is an announcement informing potential venders that its the Ohio National Guards  intention to stay with its current food provider per Far Part 6.302-1 (A) (B). The substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. To save any unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements listed below:<BR>   <BR>1. The vendor is to provide a single delivery of all subsistence items to various units of the Army National Guard.  The choice of meal and the quantity of meals requested by the supported unit will determine the items and quantity. All deliveries will be made to the supported unit between 7:30 am  4:30 pm on either Thursday or Friday. The two-week Annual Training (AT) support and special schools will be determined, as requirements are known. Delivery for these would be every other day or as needed due to refrigeration storage. <BR><BR>2. The vendor will provide a single point of contact for the Government, with toll free direct communications (no electronic answering devices) during normal working hours (7:30 am-4:30 pm). This point of contact will provide same day responses to government inquiries for effective customer service as required.<BR><BR>3. At no cost to the government, the vendor will provide the government with a means of electronic communication (i.e., e-mail, facsimile), or a web based ordering system to order subsistence. Only the Contracting Officer or a duly appointed ordering officer will place orders on behalf of the Army National Guard, 14 days before the scheduled training. The orders shall contain the following information: date of order; contract number and order number; item number and description; quantity and unit price; extended price; delivery day; place of delivery and accounting data. The vendor shall acknowledge receipt of the order within 3 working days of receipt by transmitting a packing list of ordered items to the supported unit. The Government reserves the right to make changes to the order up to forty-eight hours before the delivery date.<BR><BR>4. At the time of delivery, the vendor will provide a receiving report to a representative of the supported unit. At a minimum, the receiving report will contain the following information: contract number and order number; shipment number and date; vendors name and address; name and address of the place of delivery; item number and description, quantity and unit price; extended price. The vendor will have the supported units representative sign a copy of the receiving report and give the representative a copy. The vendor will consolidate all receiving reports for each delivery order and prepare a corresponding invoice. The vendor will submit their invoice and supporting receiving reports to the Deputy Chief of Staff Logistics Office. The ordering officer will certify the invoice for payment and the Commercial Accounts division of the USPFO will pay the vendor by electric funds transfer. <BR><BR>5. The subsistence items to be delivered will meet current health and sanitation standards required by the USDA and the Department of Health. The quality of items is to meet the specification standards cited in the most recent edition of the Federal Supply Catalog C8900-SL. (May be viewed on the Internet at: www.dscp.dla.mil.) All items will be name brand items. The supported unit shall designate a representative to inspect all shipments. If delivered items are spoiled, outdated, or damaged the unit representative will not accept those items, and the delivery ticket/invoice will be annotated to reflect any adjustments. It will then be the responsibility of the vendor to replace those items or authorize the government to replace at the vendors expense. The Government must exercise its post acceptance rights within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered. NOTE: The vendor is required to make the best effort at providing the required product.<BR><BR>6. Additional items ancillary to the meals previously identified may be ordered on an as needed basis, such as condiments and any other food or confection normally consumed in an institutional setting. <BR><BR>7. Suitable packaging based on the quantity needs and the Government requires issue factor of an item. As example, if a unit needs 100 portions of fresh potatoes for oven browned potatoes with an issue factor of 50 pounds per 100 portions, then the unit should get one 50 pound bag of potatoes, not ten 5-pound bags. Additionally, a unit needing only 10 portions should receive one 5-pound bag of potatoes. <BR><BR>8. The Government reserves the right to order in quantities less than case (or whatever bulk unit of issue is normally used for that item) lots for specified items. In the event less than bulk quantities are required, the vendor will break cases to accommodate the required order quantity. The Government will not pay extra for broken case orders.<BR><BR>9. It is recognized that fresh fruits, vegetables and other produce during certain seasons of the year are in critical short supply. When sufficient quantities of fresh foodstuffs as required are not available from throughout the United States or from other than domestic sources, the aforementioned products are excluded from the Buy American/Defense Appropriations Act and are authorized to be of foreign origin. <BR><BR>10. The Delivered Price is defined as the actual invoice price of menu items that the vendor has supplied to the designated unit.<BR><BR>11. The vender will provide to the government individual menu items prices in a format that can be imported into an MS Access database not later than 15 days after award of contract.  <BR><BR>12. The vender must be registered  in with the Central Contractors Registration (CCR).  WWW.CCR.GOV<BR><BR>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.   <BR>

<DESC>The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to enter into a sole source contract with the City of Chattanooga Police Department, TN, to assist in providing training on weapons, tactics, explosives and breaching.

The City of Chattanooga Police Department is the only organization within 40 miles of an NRC Regional Office, Technical Training Center or Headquarters Office which can provide a live fire range for up to fifteen stations, elevated (tower) firing positions, night fire capability, an explosives range certified for up to fifteen pounds TNT equivalent, offsite classroom facilities, along with the certifications and personnel to assist in training NRC inspectors.  These qualifications allow the NRC to provide classroom and hands-on experience with various types of semi-auto and full-auto weaponry up to and including .50 caliber, night-fire characteristics, mobile shooting platforms, and numerous types and effects of explosive charges.  This training allows for trainees to perform tasks required by NRC licensees as well as potential adversarial components in order to better perform regulatory responsibilities.

The proposed period of performance is one year from the date of award, with the option to extend the period of performance for four additional one-year optional periods. 

Requests for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

A determination not to compete this requirement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested parties must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs to Jeffrey R. Mitchell, Contract Specialist, by e-mail at Jeffrey.Mitchell@NRC.GOV or mail at 11555 Rockville Pike, Mail Stop TWB-01-B10M, Rockville MD 20852, or fax to (301)492-3639 not later than May 20, 2009.

<SUBJECT>Technical Assistance in the Resolution of Public Comments Resulting from a Revision to the Division of Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation (SFST) Standard Review Plans (SRPs) for the Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel
<SOLNBR>NMS-09-010
<RESPDATE>051209
<CONTACT>Manon L. Butt, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-492-3629, Fax 301-492-3437, Email manon.butt@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole source contract entitled “Technical Assistance in the Resolution of Public Comments Resulting from a Revision to the Division of Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation (SFST) Standard Review Plans (SRPs) for the Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel” with Information Systems Laboratories (ISL), Inc.  The work would include categorizing and answering public comments as well as making any associated changes to the storage SRPs prior to final publication.  The period of performance for this project is approximately 23 months.  The 23 month estimated schedule coincides with the time period for receiving the public comments to publishing the final version of the subject SRPs.

The proposed contract is a follow-on effort to contract NRC-02-06-006 entitled “Technical Assistance in Risk-Informing Spent Fuel Project Office Standard Review Plans for Storage and Incorporating Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) Documents.”  Under the current contract, ISL is responsible for updating NUREG-1536 and NUREG-1567 by incorporating information from ISG documents and including any applicable emergent technical issues.  ISL is also responsible for developing a risk informing process and applying it to the SRP’s review procedures.

The revised SRPs contain a first-of-a-kind, potentially controversial risk-informing methodology for dry cask storage that has never been issued or used by either the NRC or the nuclear industry.  Based on staff experience with resolving public comments on controversial documents such as these, the staff expects a significant number of highly technical comments on the methodology that will challenge NRC risk-informing policies, risk analyses, and regulatory auditing strategies.  Resolution of public comments on the SFST storage SRPs will require specific knowledge of applied risk informing methodologies evaluated, developed and utilized by ISL in risk informing these storage SRPs.  As both the developer of the methodology and lead author of its description in the SRP, ISL is intimately familiar with the methodology and its application.  During the performance of the current contract, ISL developed three risk-informing methodologies for utilization in meeting the contract’s objective of identifying SRP areas that were of higher or lower relative significance.  ISL evaluated these methodologies by applying them to a few sample SRP chapters, by interviewing NRC technical staff, and determining which method was best suited for the application.  Once a method was selected, it was applied to all the applicable portions of the SRP chapters to determine the relative risk significance of the review procedures.  There is a high likelihood that public and industry comments will focus on this first of a kind risk informing of the SRPs, resulting in a significant number of comments regarding this risk methodology.  

The standard review plan is approximately 322 pages in length with 14 distinct technical areas.  Based on staff experience, public comments on large documents like these address multiple technical areas with both specific technical comments and those that are more general in nature that may apply to many areas.  Technical resolution of these comments will require the judgment and expertise of NRC staff.  However, an important initial effort in the resolution of public comments is the review of each comment and then placing them into related technical or policy categories (i.e. binning).  Based on ISL staff experience with binning comments from external stakeholders, many comments may be duplicative of other comments, and/or consist of several sub-comments that need to be broken down into individual categories.  This binning process will require an intimate knowledge of the SRP’s format and content, otherwise extra effort and cost would be needlessly expended familiarizing a new contractor with the large documents.   As the technical editor of the storage SRPs, ISL has the required prerequisite knowledge of the SRP format and general content within the 14 distinct technical areas to assist the NRC staff in this binning process.  Over the past two years, ISL has interviewed several NRC staff in most of the distinct technical areas to better understand its contents as part of the risk-informing process.  A different contractor would have to spend considerable time familiarizing themselves with the format and content of the several documents.

ISL has extensive experience associated with the risk informing of regulatory guidance documents and inspection procedures.  It is highly unlikely that another contractor could perform the requirements as cost effectively as ISL since no other contractor is familiar with the SFST storage SRPs, the risk informing process developed by ISL, or the ISGs that have been incorporated into the SRPs.  Another contactor would have to expend considerable time and effort to acquire ISL’s current understanding of the storage SRPs and the risk informing methodology developed by ISL.  Another contractor would also not have the in-depth knowledge of the bases behind the risk informing methodology in order to properly defend it in the public arena.

The statutory authority for negotiating on a sole-source basis with ISL is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the services are available from only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy NRC’s requirements. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990.  This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC’s needs.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Manon Butt, Contract Specialist, via email to manon.butt@nrc.gov no later than May 12, 2009.  Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUESTED
The BLM requests bids on a contract to rehabilitate and improve wildlife habitat in southeastern Idaho.  The contract would involve planting a total of about 25,000 sagebrush seedlings, by manual or mechanical means, over an area of about 45-50 acres in the area of the Curlew Valley, Oneida County, in southeastern Idaho.  The contractor would supply the adapted plant materials.  Planting would occur in late autumn 2009 or early spring 2010; late autumn would be the preferred period of planting.  STATEMENT OF WORK
Grow or Procure Seedlings:
  Procure or grow-out ~25,000 healthy and viable seedlings of mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata subsp. vaseyana).  At time of planting, the seedlings would be at least ten inches in overall length with well-developed roots and leaves.  Seedlings may be bare rootstock or soil plugs.  
  The BLM will inspect the plant materials prior to planting; e.g. at two months, six months and during planting.  
Planting in the Field:
  Field Site is located in the Curlew Valley, in southwest corner of Oneida County, near the Idaho-Utah border.  Four to six specific planting sites that comprise lands that wildfires have burned since 2002.  Topography is flat to gently rolling foothills.  
  Handling and Planting of Seedlings: Handling and planting procedures will be followed to minimize dehydration or damage to the planting materials; e.g. seedling roots will be maintained and packed to minimize seedling dehydration; the day of planting, plant materials will be soaked in water prior to planting; plant materials will be planting into holes or furrows deep enough to minimize the frequency of J-rooting when the seedlings are placed in the soil.  
  Planting Configuration: Furrows would be spaced about 10 ft. apart.  Within furrows, plants would be spaced about 8-10 ft. apart.  Spatially, plant density would be expected to range between about 440 and 680 plants per acre, with a median density of about 550 plants per acre.  
  Season of Planting: Planting would occur in late autumn, i.e. about early November through mid-December, or in early spring; i.e. late March or earlier, through late April.  Planting in late autumn would be preferable to early spring planting.  The earlier the better, if it becomes necessary to plant in the spring.  
  A 4WD tractor of at least 80 bhp would be required to pull the BLM seedling planter (below).
Government Furnished Materials:
  The BLM would have available to the vendor, a two-person seedling planter with a standard three-point hitch.

Solicitation Number:  FDA1056086

Response Date: 12 May 2009

DESCRIPTION:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541712 for a 100% small business set-aside.  

The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the following laboratory case model validation. 

Summary: 
Validation of the Magneto Hydro Dynamic (MHD) simulation platform for the study of MHD induced signals during MRI scans (already developed) and investigation of the MHD effect by simulations and measurements. This work is mainly based on the Virtual Family male model (with revised aorta and vena cava model) and the corresponding MRI measurements. 

Background: 
The overall research objective is to investigate and characterize an electromagnetic biomarker for heart failure (HF) and recovery. The goal is to develop a method to non-invasively characterize cardiac dynamics, including stroke volume and cardiac output. The research will assess information about blood flow that can supplement present non-invasive ultrasound techniques for the evaluation of heart failure. The new physiological biomarker that will be evaluated is the MHD signal recorded on the electrocardiograom (ECG) while the subject is in the strong static magnetic field of a magnetic resonance imager (MRI). This MHD signal is caused by blood flow in the magnetic field. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the MHD signal is capable of the rapid and non-invasive flow measurements that are necessary for evaluating HF, particularly diastolic HF. Such signals have been collected in both animals and humans by other investigators. Analysis of the MHD signal recorded with the 12-lead ECG in conjunction with physiological measurements will require electromagnetic modeling to determine the sources of the signals (i.e., ventricle, aorta, coronary arteries, and carotid arteries) and the size of the magnetic field needed to obtain useful physiological signals. The final goal is to determine locations and blood-flow vectors (magnitude and direction) that may be used as functional biomarkers for cardiac function in healthy and HF subjects. 

Previous work: 
In the first phase of the this project a MHD solver was developed that reads in a given flow distribution and, based on a novel quasistatic approximation, calculates the resulting electric field distribution due to the application of an external magnetic field and its interaction with the charged particles in the blood flow. The solver has been fully integrated into SEMCAD X and works with the detailed anatomical full-body models available for SEMCAD X. The SEMCAD X modeling, import and export feature have been extended (including scripting interface). Novel postprocessing functionality has been added. 

Statement of Work: 
The purpose of this purchase order is the validation of the previously developed MHD solver and its application to a model case (based on Virtual Family male).  For this the following tasks need to be performed: 
1) Development and delivery of aorta and vena cava models suitable for computational flow simulations based on the Virtual Family male data. The aorta model should include the descending and abdominal aorta with branches into iliac arteries (abdominal bifurcation). The vena cava model should include the anterior and posterior part of the vena cava model. All models should be delivered as CAD models in *.sat format. 
2) Transient (pulsatile) simulations of realistic temporal blood flow distribution (unlike the steady state flow solution used under contract HHSF22320081116P) with 0.01 second temporal resolution in the vessel structures developed in Task 1 using flow solvers. 
3) Comparison of the spatial and temporal simulated blood flow distribution with MRI velocity measurements which are compatible with the original Virtual Family male model. The simulated data should be within 20% of the MRI velocity measurements. 
The FDA will use the MHD solver developed under contract HHSF22320081116P to select optimized surface locations, on the Virtual Family male model, for MHD measurements. These locations will be provided to the contractor so that they may: 
4) Extract MHD time curves for the selected optimized surface locations from multiple MHD simulations, 
5) Compare ECG (free space) and ECG+MHD (in 3 Tesla MRI field) simulations to recorded measurements, under the same conditions, from an anatomy similar to the actual Virtual Family male model. 

QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov) before 4:30 pm (1630) EST on 4 May 2009.  

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination.  FOB Destination means the contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. 
 
Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor described to "Meet or Exceed the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance is significantly more important than price.  

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quoters shall include their understanding of the requirement and any past performance that can support your quote or other literature which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered service meets or exceeds the specifications stated herein.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor (PSC) Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military - Worldwide (Multiple Positions)

1.  SOLICITATION NO.: M/OAA/DCHA/DOFDA-09-934

2.  ISSUANCE DATE: April 27, 2009

3.  CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: June 8, 2009 at 5:00 p.m. EDT

4.  POSITION TITLE: Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military

5.  MARKET VALUE:  GS-13 ($70,615 - $91,801 – not eligible for locality pay.)  Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate’s past salary, work history and educational background.  

6.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Two years, renewable up to five years

7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Worldwide

There may be an initial training program in Washington, D.C. for up to one year, which will include formal classroom training and on-the-job training; and may include security training.

After completion of Washington training, the Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/M) may be assigned to Washington, other locations in the United States, or an overseas office, and will be required to serve through rotational assignments.  At any time, at the discretion of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) Headquarters, the incumbent may be reassigned/relocated to a geographical location where the individual’s services are needed.

Applicants for the HAA/M position must be willing to be posted at any location.  The potential posts are listed as follows, but the location of service could be ultimately determined by the location of future unknown operational requirements.

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA’s capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  OPS performs these functions through three teams, namely, Operations Support Team, Overseas Administration Team and Field Support Team.  The Operations Support Team provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue, Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, and Consequence Management.  It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA’s capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  The Operations Liaison Unit (OLU) is part of this team and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>Q: Pursuant to our previous manual request, to-date we have not been able to obtain the TI-8048, Test Instruction for the AFT3 Manual from Honeywell.

A: Honeywell intends to have a data package ready the week of May 4, 2009.  As stated in the Statement of Objectives, "all GE and Honeywell technical manuals are proprietary to the OEM.  Contractors must be able to obtain independently."  The CG has performed due diligence in attempting to make the information available, and will extend the proposal due date one final time to May 15, 2009 NLT 3 pm EST; however, there will be no further extensions as the CG requires that this project move forward expeditiously.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA’s response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations.  SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

The SRG program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in OFDA/OPS.  This team maintains a database for all contracted Support Relief Group staff and provides information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified SRG for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing SRG.  Each SRG incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires SRG personnel to meet its surge capacity objectives, and to strengthen its capability to support OFDA’s mandate and the delivery of humanitarian assistance around the world.  OFDA will extend consideration to generalists and to applicants with specific educational and professional experience, including in one of the following humanitarian sectors:  Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH); Food Security, Agriculture, and Livestock; and Shelter and Settlements.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

All SRG personnel will be responsible for performing all or some of the tasks below. However, all work will be done in coordination with OFDA personnel.  SRG personnel are considered U.S. Government (USG) employees, and, as such, are required to further USG foreign policy objectives.

SRG personnel respond to humanitarian emergencies - natural, technological and conflict-related disasters - as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on Response Management Teams (RMTs), which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a USG disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.  

•	Conduct initial assessments of the vulnerable populations and recommend appropriate relief activities.  Facilitate and coordinate USG emergency response activities with the USAID Mission, with other donor agencies, and with the U.S. Embassy.

•	Coordinate and liaise with other responders, i.e., government agencies, international organizations or private voluntary organizations.  Brief host governments, U.S. Embassy, USAID Mission, and the U.S. Military as necessary;
•	Coordinate and manage oversight of OFDA-funded activities to ensure the proper use of OFDA program funds.  Monitor financial statements from the grantee(s) and the timeliness and quality of response(s);
•	Identify disaster mitigation measures where appropriate that could be linked to disaster response activities.  Review mitigation principles and recommend course(s) of action to OFDA/Washington staff;
•	Develop various types of country/regional strategies for field offices, DARTs and assessment teams.  Provide briefings and written reports as required;
•	Conduct personnel-related activities, property management, safety and security assessments, supply management, contracting services, leasing, travel, and records management, as needed and when tasked;
•	Coordinate delivery of relief supplies provided by OFDA. Ensure that distribution is carried out in accordance with USAID policies and regulations and with OFDA strategies;
•	Interpret USAID policies and apply them to OFDA activities as appropriate;
•	Determine availability of support resources including staff, equipment, storage, office space, and communications; identify the obligating authority for procurement of supplies, commodities and services;
•	Participate in appropriate training either as a participant and/or trainer;
•	Operate DART communications equipment and operate a four-wheel drive or standard-shift vehicle in cross-country conditions;
•	Provide expert advice to OFDA DARTs, RMTs, regional missions, and/or OFDA’s Washington-based staff on humanitarian issues for populations at risk in conflict, disaster affected, or otherwise food-insecure areas;
•	Foster an effective team environment; guide and coordinate the work of other team members when serving as Response Manager, DART Leader, or other supervisory capacity;
•	Adhere strictly to Embassy and Mission security guidelines, coordinate all travel with the DART Leader, the DART Security Officer, the USAID Executive Officer (EXO) and/or the Washington-based RMT.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The incumbent will take direction from and report to the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) Leader or his/her designee, and that person designated as his/her supervisor in the Staffing Authorization. 

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment in responding to needs.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Rome Research Site (RRS) intends to establish an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to furnish all pricing, documentation, management, supervision, labor, equipment, devices, transportation, materials, insurance and all other work required to accomplish delivery orders in the following areas of maintenance, repair, replacement, and minor construction: (1) Earthwork and demolition, (2) Base courses and asphalt pavements, (3) Concrete curbing and sidewalks, (4) Storm drainage, (5) Pavement markings and signage, (6) Tree and shrub replacement, and (7) Installation and sealing of retaining walls and decorative concrete pavers. Total combined asphalt and concrete paved areas for all sites is approximately thirty (30) acres.</p>
<p>The first delivery order issued against the IDIQ contract will be funded with Recovery Act funds.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 238990 with an associated size standard of $14,000,000 average annual revenue. The procurement will be unrestricted with regard to business size standard.</p>
<p>Draft versions of the Contract Specifications, Bid Schedule, Past Performance Questionnaire, and Cost Index are posted as attachments to this presolicitation notice. Questions and comments about these draft documents are requested from potential offerors. Submit all questions in writing to: Bryant Soule, Contract Speciliast, at bryant.soule@rl.af.mil.</p>
<p>The Request For Proposal (RFP) will be posted online at the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov under the reference number FA8751-09-R-0006 on or about FRI 27 MAR 09. Proposals will be due approximately 30 days later. A site visit will be conducted about 10 days after issuance of the RFP. The date will be finalized when the RFP is posted.</p>
<p>The RFP documents will only be available electronically. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the RFP documents and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and any additional information.</p>

The multiple award decision will be based on Price / Past Performance Trade-Off as identified in FAR Part 15. It is intended that the first award will be made to the lowest priced responsible offeror if that offeror receives a past performance rating of Substantial Confidence. The Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to make multiple awards or if the lowest priced offeror does not receive a past performance rating of Substantial Confidence.</p>
<p>Interested vendors may register their contact information at the Federal Business Opportunities website under this notice. AFRL will post the list as an attachment to the RFP in order to facilitate subcontracting and teaming opportunities.</p>

<DESC><p>The 526th ICBMSG is seeking potential sources for a Minuteman III replacement fuze. The Air Force is interested in a single, common fuze for Minuteman III compatible with both MK 12A and MK 21 reentry vehicles and their payloads. There are no new fuze performance requirements. However, the common fuze, when utilized in either reentry vehicle, must provide the combination of fuzing options available with existing MK12A and MK21 fuzes. The Air Force is also interested in mass and volume reductions to accommodate potential future requirements in other reentry vehicle subsystems. The fuze must be integrated into Minuteman III with minimum impacts to the weapon system. The government is considering awarding contracts to two teams for Technology Development through the Preliminary Design Review and down selecting to one contract team for Engineering Development and Production. The government may consider other acquisition strategies if in the Government's best interest. Please send your responses to Jed Noorda at jed.noorda@hill.af.mil or Scott Wessell scott.wessell@hill.af.mil.

Potential offerors should submit a 1 page report with the offeror's relevant experience and capabilities in reentry fuzing. The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.</p>
<p>This SSS does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or any obligation on behalf of the Government. Vendor participation is not a promise of future business with the Government.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to respond to contractor's question.
<p>Question: I noticed that the posting for FA2517-09-T-6058 (maintenance and repair of IDS at Peterson AFB),included an attached sample of a DD254 form. The instructions in the solicitation did not specify that a DD254 form was needed in the submittal. I just wanted to clarify and confirm if you do, indeed, need a DD254 included in our submittal package.</p>
<p>Response: A DD Fm 254 is not required to be submitted with the proposal; however, the contractor must be able to meet the security requirements IAW the performance work statement paragraph 1.3.</p>

<DESC>This notice is directed to Missile Defense Agency (MDA) incumbent small business concerns who are currently performing advisory and assistance services (A&AS) for the agency.  This notice meets the requirement of FAR 10.001(c)(2) and no other notification will be sent to affected contractors.  MDA has previously published this acquisition strategy and discussed it during the industry days.  

The Missile Defense Agency intends to consolidate and bundle existing legacy efforts, to include contracts and other government agency transactions for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS), and transfer the work to a single program office within Missile Defense Agency (MDA), for requirements management and execution.  The agency is converting the A&AS work from a project oriented level of effort construct under multiple organizations to a ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) functionally aligned A&AS workforce approach.  The A&AS effort has been aligned into six capability groups:  1) Quality, Safety, and Mission Assurance Support, 2) Acquisition Support, 3) Engineering Support, 4) Infrastructure and Deployment Support, 5) Agency Operations Support, and 6) Security and Intelligence Support.  The work will be solicited under two separate Requests for Proposal (RFPs), one unrestricted, on a full and open competition basis, (HQ0147-09-R-0002) and one, as a small business set aside (HQ0147-09-R-0001).   It is anticipated that multiple ID/IQ contracts will be awarded and awards will be made at the capability group level for the specific work contained in each RFP.

<DESC>This AMENDMENT to the SOURCE SOUGHT NOTICE responds to vendor questions and extends the RESPONSE DATE.
RECOVERY ACT Program Management and Construction Management - Sources Sought - Questions & Answers
Q1: Our question is regarding exclusion. In the event that a firm was awarded the contract, would they be excluded from other contract opportunities performing similar work with either the DOI or other federal agencies?
A1: A firm will be excluded from other contract opportunities only if a conflict of interest exists. The parameters to determine conflict of interest issues will be identified in a subsequent solicitation.
Q2: The DOI Sources Sought indicates that "Tasks would include all or part of the services listed in the GSA 871 Schedule Summary for the following three Schedules:"  These are 871-1, -2 and -7.  It says the vendor is required to "have expertise" in all three GSA 871 Schedules.  Does this mean we have to be on the 871 Schedule for these three SIN numbers?
Currently, we are on the 871 Schedule for SINs -1 and -2 and also for -6 which formerly included the construction management services.  We are in the process of expanding our qualifications to include SIN -7.
The question is, given the above, are we able to submit for the DOI Program/Construction Management for Stimulus Projects?
A2: The procurement strategy will be determined after receipt of information requested. DOI might consider Schedules 871 (PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES) and 874 (MOBIS).
Q3: Is this set-aside for small business?   
A3: It is DOI's intention to conduct this acquisition in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4, which states that FAR Part 19 does not apply to orders placed against Federal Supply Schedules contracts. 
Q4: Is this a temporary support service contract or is this a term contract with option years? 
A4: The period of performance for this procurement is unknown at this time and will be indicated in a subsequent solicitation.
Q5: Are you looking for one contractor to run all the nationwide projects? If that is the case will that not defeat the spirit of stimulus package which is supposedly design to help the small business which are hurting bad. 
A5. The procurement strategy, which might include a multiple award vehicle, will be determined after receipt of information requested. 
Q6: If a Firm has capabilities in the three identified areas of expertise, but do not have a PES Schedule contract, may they submit a bid on a MOBIS or other appropriate GSA Schedule contract? 
A6: The procurement strategy will be determined after receipt of information requested. DOI might consider Schedules 871 (PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES) and 874 (MOBIS).
Q7: Please confirm that a traditional team of Prime Contractor with subcontractors meet the government's desire for a "single vendor" 
A7: Yes, the traditional team of prime contractor with subcontractors meets the government's definition for a single vendor.
Q8: Would a successful offeror have a conflict of interest for any of the resulting construction projects?
A8: A firm will be excluded from other contract opportunities only if a conflict of interest exists. The parameters to determine conflict of interest issues will be identified in a subsequent solicitation.
Q9: Does the 10 page limit include the 3 one page qualifications? We assume so, but wanted to double check.
A9: Yes, the 3 one page qualifications are included in the 10 page limit. Q10: Your Sources Sought you mention GSA Schedule 871, you don't say that you will be using that Schedule, but we are inferring that you might. The problem is that we do not have that Schedule. Our suggestion is that to the extent you wish to use that Schedule please also use the GSA MOBIS or FABS Schedule. We could team with a firm on the GSA 871 Schedule, but as we bring all the service lines that you would require under one roof, we would greatly prefer to bid as a prime contractor. The question is what GSA Schedule do you plan to use and would you consider including GSA MOBIS or FABS. 
A10. The procurement strategy will be determined after receipt of information requested. DOI might consider Schedules 871 (PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES) and 874 (MOBIS).
Q11: Is there a possibility for an extension of time to this sources sought?  The information requested in questions 1, 2,&3 are complex narrative solutions and administration of Recovery Act projects and will require significant programmatic responses.  We would request additional time to be able to provide the best value solution for the determination of the market survey for Government review.  Additionally, will there be any emphasis or specific request and evaluation for small business or 8(a) contractor consideration?  
A11: The deadline for responses is extended to Wednesday, April 29, 2009 at 5 PM EST.
Q12: Does the 10 page limit include the pages for project reference, or is it 10 pages plus 3 for projects? 
A12: Yes, the 10 page limit includes the pages for project references.
Q13: We would like to request an extension of this due date in order to assemble the appropriate documents as outlined in the sources sought notice.  
A13: The deadline for responses is extended to Wednesday, April 29, 2009 at 5 PM EST.
Q14: We are on the PES Schedule but do not have the 871-7 which is relatively new.  We covered CM under the -6 and are filing to get the -7.  In the meantime, we need to know if we are eligible to respond.
A14. The procurement strategy will be determined after receipt of information requested. DOI might consider Schedules 871 (PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES) and 874 (MOBIS).
Q15: Is the submission of a .pdf file acceptable?
A15: Yes.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b) sole source with Karin Jegalian, 4707 Guilford Road, College Park, MD 20740-3733, for the continuation of services to monitor the variety of tasks, including: Writing materials, such as: News and feature articles, fact sheets, and Web articles about NIGMS-supported research advances and programs. Reports of NIGMS-sponsored scientific meetings. Publicity materials for the annual Stetten Lecture (speaker biographies, program notes, etc.). Editing or providing feedback on materials, such as: Material written by other OCPL staff members. Material written for print or online publication by NIGMS scientific staff. Public information duties related to the writing assignments above, for example: Communicating with university public information officers and journalists who are writing about NIGMS-funded research. Maintaining the NIGMS media contacts list on Cision (formerly Bacon's MediaSource). Other activities: Screening scientific journals and news releases (Eurekalert!) and distributing the articles to appropriate NIGMS staff. Maintaining spreadsheets to track analyses of journal articles in press and to track OCPL contacts with PIOs. Obtaining permission from grantees to use images in OCPL publications. Maintaining the OCPL image gallery. The sole source determination is based on the fact that the contractor has the experience, knowledge and is familiar with the NIGMS ongoing projects. An award to any other source for the continuation of this service would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The period of performance is from June 26, 2008 to June 27, 2009. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This requirement is classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990, size standard $6.5 Million. The Small Business Set-Aside applies to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit capability statements by email to hobsonkd@OD.nih.gov, Contract Specialist by April 28, 2009 at 1:00 P.M. EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. PLEASE, NO PHONE CALLS.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   This requirement is now cancelled. Currently the Statement of Work is being revised. Please monitor this site for the revisions.  Please email Mr. Micole Cheatham at cheatham.micole@epa.gov with any concearns.


NAICS Code: 541380 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Office of Emergency Response (OEM) desires to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of analyzing environmental sample matrices contaminated by toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs), biological agents, and radiochemical agents as a result of acts of terrorism or an environmental emergency. A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; instead, it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition. OVERVIEW: The requirement is to ensure consistent analytical data of known and documented quality across the Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN) (see SOW for full purpose).  A laboratory's admission to the ERLN will be based on completion of the documents submitted by the laboratory in the form of the Laboratory Membership Application and capability statement for EPA's ERLN. These documents will be evaluated by the EPA.  Please refer to the specific instructions provided in each section of the ERLN application. The ERLN application for vendors to complete can be found on EPA's webpage: http://epa.gov/oam/srpod/. under the following RFQ number, RFQ-DC-09-00160. Any and all services rendered by vendors will be ordered via the issuance of task orders and under the competitive requirements of FAR Part 6 and synopsis requirements of FAR Part 5, as applicable. Please note this is not a solicitation announcement for proposals. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and/or any follow-up information requests. No telephone calls and/or requests for a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged.  Company brochures are not desired.  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: A few general requirements are as follows: (1)The laboratory shall provide analytical services for the isolation, detection, and quantitative measurement of biological, chemical, and/or radiological agents in samples collected in support of environmental responses. (2) The laboratory shall adhere to the methods and technical requirements specified in the project-specific task order when testing ERLN samples and reporting results. The laboratory shall immediately report positive or suspect test results to authorized ERLN personnel only.(3) The laboratory shall possess and have operational all necessary measurement and testing equipment/instrumentation required to perform the applicable test as specified in the methods reference in the project-specific task order, prior to receipt of samples.(4) The laboratory shall submit a unique data package for each data reporting group received for a project at the data submission level, in the appropriate medium (computer-readable, PDF, hardcopy), and within the timeframe specified in the project-specific task order. The laboratory shall submit these data to the authorized ERLN Representative specified in the project-specific task order.The General requirements in their entirety are detailed in  the SOW (attachment 1) under  RFQ-DC-09-00160 on the EPA website under the following link:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/solam.htm.     
SUBMISSION   INSTRUCTIONS: Interested vendors should provide a completed ERLN membership application along with their Capabilities/Qualifications information describing their ability to meet all of the requirements of the SOW within thirty (30) days of this notice. All responsible vendors may submit an original and two (2) copies of their capabilities and qualifications to perform, in writing, to the identified point of contact (POC) not later than 3:00 PM Eastern Time on 05/02/2009. Capabilities/Qualifications documentation may be submitted  to the POC via  email  to: bell.ron@epa.gov  and Cheatham.Micole@epa.gov or may be mailed via U.S. Postal Service to: U.S. EPA Ariel Rios Building, Attn: Ron Bell, Mail Code 3805R, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20460; or, via commercial delivery or courier service to: U.S. EPA Ronald Reagan Building, Attn: Ron Bell/  Mail Code 3805R , Room 61166, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004.

<SUBJECT>84--Revision to Presolicitation Notice for the Enhanced Combat Helmet
<SOLNBR>M6785409R3025
<CONTACT>Lisandra Torres E-mail Only
<DESC>This is a revision to PRESOLICITATION NOTICE M67854-09-R-3025 Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) previously issued on 25 February 2009.  MARCORSYSCOM, now in conjunction with US Army PEO Soldier, intends to procure prototype combat helmets for evaluation with the option to field additional quantities of helmets.  The forthcoming solicitation will be issued on the basis of full and open competition.  The NAICS code remains 339113, Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing, with a size standard of 500.  This is a revision to a Presolicitation Notice only; no proposals are being requested at this time.  Information contained in this notice is subject to change.
MARCORSYSCOM and PEO Soldier are interested in investigating an Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH), capable of meeting all current combat helmet requirements (i.e., USMC Lightweight Helmet and US Army Advanced Combat Helmet), but exhibiting significantly improved ballistic performance (minimum 35% increase compared to current minimums) against fragmentation, handgun and small arms threats. The specified geometry of these helmets for the Marine Corps' requirements - full PASGT geometry, tactical (MICH/ACH) geometry, or both - is as yet undecided but will be stated in the solicitation.  The specified geometry for the Army's requirements will be the ACH.  Suspension/retention systems for all helmets will be from approved mandatory sources of supply.  Interested offerors will be limited to two material solutions (maximum of two (2) proposals each) for the ECH based on the current state-of-the-art materials.  If the Marine Corps selects the full PASGT geometry, offerors will be limited!  to a maximum of four (4) proposals each, two material solutions per geometry.
Offerors must be able to demonstrate the capability to produce an ECH with the minimum V50s and not exceeding the maximum weights at the time of proposal submission.  One or more product demonstration models (consisting of a complete helmet with the currently approved mandatory source of supply suspension/retention systems) will be required as part of the proposal submittal.  Complete requirements for the written proposal(s) will be set forth in the solicitation, but it is anticipated they will include the following among others: material composition and lay-up, description of basic manufacturing processes, shell weights and thicknesses, rapid production capabilities and delivery schedule, and ballistic performance.  Ballistic test data required will include V50s for the 2-, 4-, 16-, and 64-grain Right Circular Cylinder (RCC) and the 17 grain Fragment Simulating Projectile (FSP) generated on actual helmets (not flat panels) from an NIJ-approved test lab. 
The Government anticipates making multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract awards.  Awards will consist of initial minimum quantities of up to 50 helmets per size in sizes small, medium, large, and extra large, per material solution proposed per geometry (for a potential maximum quantity of 800 per contract (or 200 per solution per geometry).  These helmets will be subjected to a battery of tests to be specified in the solicitation.  If further evaluation is required, the Government may purchase additional prototype quantities above the contract minimum.  These additional line items may consist of one to several hundred helmets per size, but no more than 2,000 each per contract.  Contract awards will also consist of additional option line items for production units, to be exercised based on the results of further evaluation.  There will be separate line items for production units for the Marine Corps' and Army's requirements.  The estimated total qua! ntity for production for Marine Corps requirements, distributed among one or more potential awardees, is 38,500 each to include spares and tariff adjustments.  The estimated total quantity for production for Army requirements, distributed among one or more potential awardees, is 200,000 each to include spares and tariff adjustments.  The total quantities for both Marine Corps and Army requirements for this ECH effort are 238,500 helmets.  Although each awarded contract may include a maximum ceiling of 238,500, under this current urgent and compelling need, it is the Government's intent to only purchase 238,500 helmets distributed among the awardees selected to go to production.  The basis for making the production option exercise decision will be set forth in the solicitation, but the Government anticipates considering the ballistic performance (V50) against fragmentation, handgun and small arms (V50 and V0) in making its determination for production, along with delivery sc! hedule and price.
Evaluation factors will be set forth in the forthcoming solicitation.  Solicitation No. M67854-09-R-3025 is anticipated to be issued within the next thirty (30) days and will be posted on the internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website located at the following address:     http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  The on-line version of the solicitation will include all documents of the solicitation package.  No hard copy of this solicitation will be issued.  Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the original solicitation.  The complete solicitation package, including amendments, should be received and reviewed prior to submitting a response.  The proposal shall be submitted in hard copy form only.  No electronic submission of proposals will be accepted.  Those responding to the solicitation have the responsibility to obtain all amendments and/or other applicable documents. !   Offerors are instructed to hold all questions until the solicitation has been issued.  Offerors shall submit ALL questions in writing to lisandra.torres@usmc.mil.  No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NOTICE:  The issuance of the RFP has been briefly delayed.  Although an exact release date is to be determined, it should be NLT 4 May 09.
The purpose of this modification is to provide Government responses to all questions submitted by interested parties to date.
1. Request clarification on the document titled Interface Drawing.  The drawings provided in the draft RFP are space claim drawings.  They provide only the location and space available for the APU and Winch.  An Interface Control Drawing would include the electrical and mechanical interface requirements, such as existing appurtenances, bosses, tapped holes, brackets, etc., which can be used for the installation of the APU and Winch system; or are these requirements that need to be developed under the contract.
Answer:  Attached please find the revised drawing, 93051, Rev. A.  In reviewing the bidder's question, they asked for "existing appurtenances, bosses, tapped holes, brackets, etc., which can be used for the installation of the APU and Winch system".  This leads me to believe that it was not clear that the vendor supplied winch mounting brackets are to be welded to the hull of the Buffalo vehicle.  The previous version of the drawing showed the weld area space for the APU mounting brackets on sheet 1 zone B-4 but did not specifically call out the weld area space for the winch mounting brackets.  This has now been clarified with an additional view on sheet 5 zone A-5 showing the weld area for the winch.


Attached drawings supercede all previous versions.

Program Activity: All Air Force (AF) commands are directed to manage their individual<br />Contracting Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) requirements under AFI 21-110 guidelines.<br />II. Description Of Action<br />a. This Class J&amp;A covers contractual actions for CETS to be awarded for FY08-FYI O. The CETS<br />will be acquired to support the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, the Air National Guard (ANG) and<br />possibly the Coast Guard tor various weapon systems/subsystems/equipment located at operational<br />AF, Al'-.J"G, MIUY, Nav-y and Coast Guard instaiiations.<br />b. The CETS requirements are establishcd in HAF-ILM(A)7150 report (or its equivalent) at HQ<br />USAFIILMM. The total estimated number of contracts to be awarded for the 3 years (FY08-FYIO) is<br />20-30, for a total estimated amount obligated of $73.875M. Cost estimates for the FY08-10 contracts<br />are based upon current negotiated prices with cost increases expected in the consumer price index<br />(CPI) range except in the unknown cases of major restructures or company mergers. A<br />10 percent escalation factor to allow for an additional surge in requirements was applied to the<br />projections obtained from the commands to arrive at the total estimated amount. Contracts will be<br />awarded and task orders issued, only after corresponding FY HAF-ILM(A)7150 requirements have<br />been validated by HQ USAFIILMM and commands have issued purchase request packages to<br />ASCIPKWRN. The cxact number of contracts/task orders and estimated amounts cannot be precisely<br />determined as commands are continually eliminating and adding CETS representatives, at their<br />respective bases, each fiscal year as requirements materialize.<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />2<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONL"" (<br />c. The CETS supports such weapon systems as F-22 NC, F-16 NC, F-15 NC, KC-135 NC and<br />A-IO NC. See attachment for all known weapon systems/equipment requiring CETS support, with<br />associated contractors and estimated dollar amount by command. All AF activities that have CETS<br />requirements must submit, on an annual basis, their HAF-ILM(A)7150 (or its equivalent) to<br />HQ USAF/ILMM. This report includes precise narrative justifications for each CETS requirement<br />including a list of the prime contractors. In accordance with AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical<br />Services, HQ USAF/ILMM reviews and validates these requirements on an annual basis. HQ<br />USAF/lLMM maintains these reports.<br />d. All of the CETS contractors are Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The OEMs have<br />successfully provided engineering and technical support over the past 30 years. They will continue to<br />do so because the success of their CETS program ensures a continued AF market for their weapon<br />systems/equipment and spare parts. The CETS OEMs place highly trained persolUlel in the field to<br />train AF maintenance tearns. The AF persolUlel continually evaluate, through weapon system and<br />team performance, the quality of service these CETS personnel provide. Since a majority ofCETS<br />contracts are follow-on, the technical capabilities of the CETS persolUlel have already been validated.<br />e. History has shown the CETS program will continue to be required by most AF commands. The<br />AF persolUlel turnover, coupled with new weapon introductions and current system modifications,<br />have been the driving force in this continuation. There is reasonable certainty that funds will be made<br />available for these fiscal years.<br />f. Contract Features: Contracts will generally be awarded in September-December timeframe<br />prior to the start of each year of performance. Contracts are written as requirement task order, service<br />type contracts. Each basic contract is usually 2-3 years in length. Based on historical data within<br />ASCIPKWRN, this is the maximum time contractors are willing to project costs for negotiations<br />because of unknown business base fluctuations affecting overhead pools (10 U.S.c. 2304b limits the<br />ordering period of anMAS task order contract to 5 years). Most actions will be awarded as new<br />contracts, with only a few modifications to existing contracts to extend services for a period oftirne.<br />The CETS contracts/task orders utilize fixed price man-month or man-day type contracts with cost<br />reimbursement CLINs for personnel support expenditures such as official travel and in some instances,<br />relocations. All CETS contracts are awarded in accordance with AFI 21-110 and are categorized as<br />non operational other contracting as defined in the Air Force FAR Supplement 5302.10 I.<br />III. Description of Supplies/Services<br />Narrative Description - The CETS program is the medium through which AF units use contractor<br />personnel, usually on a man-month basis, to provide on-site proficiency training, technical advice and<br />technical assistance for initial system bed down when organic skills are not available. As such, the AF<br />acquires specialized, technical nonpersonal services that are essential in accomplishing the assigned<br />mission of the equipment and/or weapon systems. The CETS contracts provide a method by which the<br />contractor can provide information to the using command on new and/or complex equipment and<br />weapon systems in the AF inventory. The CETS contracts also encompass on-the-job training ofAF<br />maintenance persolUlel by employees of the prime contractor. The CETS representative's main duties<br />consist ofthe following:<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />3<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />Give on-site technical advice and hands-on training on all aspects of equipment<br />maintenance and operations including modifications and retrofits<br />Advise and train on special tools, handling equipment, test equipment, and other<br />related items<br />Comply with and emphasize safety precautions<br />Provide maintenance and operational information from the manufacturer<br />Assist in mishap investigations and failure data reporting<br />Perform direct maintenance only under unusual or emergency circumstances<br />a. The AF CETS program is covered by this Class J&amp;A for all FY08-FYIO contractual actions.<br />b. Total estimated value of the efforts contemplated in this J&amp;A is $73.875M.<br />IV. Authority<br />The statutory authority which permits other than full and open competition for this class of<br />contract actions is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). In the case of each<br />individual contract, there is only one responsible source, and no other services will satisfy agency<br />re quirements.<br />V. Applicability of Authority<br />For each acquisition awarded under the authority of this J&amp;A, the agencies' minimum needs can<br />'o..~... sal'I'sI~leQ"oy uru''lu,,- ;;:,,-r--v-'~'-'e&lt; "-VlJl,..':,',,_UL ",,, u"'-u--u, v"nI&middot;&middot; _ ~ ..

The OEM contractor also provides critical, updated<br />technical data to the CETS representatives in the field. Furthermore, the expertise ofthe OEM<br />contractor's research, development, manufacturing, and administrative teams, buoyed by the learning<br />curve effect ofthe manufacturing redesigning, modification and refining process, is not available<br />outside the original equipment manufacturer. Only CETS support contracts have the ability to reach<br />any specific expert at any time. The AF lacks the expert resources and data necessary to establish an<br />organic capability for these services when weapon systems/equipment or modifications thereto are<br />initially fielded. The services are contracted from the manufacturer ofthe equipment or weapon<br />systems in accordance with the policies and procedures in AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical<br />Services. However, if this expertise should become available from sources other than the OEM,<br />competition will be attempted. The OEMs are designated as sole source for CETS provided in support<br />of AF major subdivisions such as AFMC, AFSOC, AFRC, AETC, AMC, AFRC, PACAF, ACe,<br />USAFE, AFSPC and the Air National Guard. Due to the fact that technical data and expertise are not<br />available except from the OEMs, award to any other source would result in unacceptable training for<br />our AF maintenance teams and a critical increase in weapon systems downtime. Based on the reasons<br />stated previously, it is also likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication<br />of costs as a result ofrequired reverse engineering. These costs would not likely be recovered through<br />competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements.<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />4<br />.( FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY. i<br />VI. Efforts to Obtain Competition<br />A presolicitation synopsis was published on I Dec 06 in the FedBizOpps following coordination<br />with the Small Business Office. No sources have formally responded to the synopsis. A prior<br />synopsis, for the FY05-FY07 program, also did not produce any new sources. Individual contract<br />synopses published over the past 3 years have not produced any new qualified sources. All CETS<br />basic contracts, that meet the criteria set forth in FAR 5.3, will be synopsized in an individual Notice<br />of Contract Action.<br />VII. Fair and Reasonable Costs<br />All proposed program costs will be thoroughly analyzed in the performance ofeach contract<br />action. Contractors will be required to submit cost or pricing data to support the government's<br />evaluation of the proposed cost/price (in accordance with TINA threshold). Technical evaluation will<br />be provided through the buying activity program managers and audit assistance from the Defense<br />Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). This information will provide the contracting officer with adequate<br />knowledge to determine a fair and reasonable price/cost.<br />VIII. Market Research<br />The market survey for the FY08-FYI 0 program consisted ofthe publication ofa presolicitation<br />synopsis placed in the FedBizOpps. It was published on I Dec 06 as noted in paragraph VI. A couple<br />of sources informally made telephone inquiries, but after further discussion with them, they did not<br />feel they could meet the basic requirements ofthe CETS program. Furthermore, market research for<br />CETS over the past 30 years has not generated any successful new sources other than the OEMs.<br />IX. Other Facts<br />a. The requirements activities' experience have been that the various commands that CETS<br />supports have contracted for Interim Contract Support (ICS) company personnel to support the USAF<br />because Technical Data is late-to-need when the system is delivered. The new systems are so<br />intensive with computer driven devices that hardware/software changes are typically late-to-need. The<br />manufacturer normally has the task of maintaining the technical data/software baseline for the USAF.<br />Until the total engineering support is transferred to the responsible Air Logistics Center (ALe), the<br />manufacturer has the only master file of current technical data.<br />b. There are many components and hardware support items that are coded weapon system<br />peculiar. The manufacturer has the specification data to cross-reference these items and provide<br />alternative part numbers and specification numbers that can be substituted for installation on a<br />component. As the weapon systern matures, the AF develops the cross-reference tables at the ALC's<br />and provides adequate support. This support is critical until in-house capabilities are developed.<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />5<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />c. Procurement of engineering drawings from the prime contractor (OEM) is often lengthy and<br />time consuming. Frequently, the OEM contractor can supply the drawings through their CETS<br />representatives within hours, thus enhancing the operating commands ability to make a major decision<br />that affects the safe operations of very expensive weapon systems during combat situations. There are<br />times when the ALC will have to go to a manufacturer for drawing support because the center does not<br />have the workforce to support a request. Having the CETS representative available eliminates this<br />time consuming procedure and increases the operational rate ofwarfighting systems.<br />d. The commands' statements of work will define all requirements to deliver a full-up operational<br />weapons system to a combat unit. Frequently during the process of production, modifications/changes<br />are made that affect the end product causing a shortfall in technical data, software and hardware for<br />sub-systems when the initial system is fielded. The CETS representatives are often the only link<br />between an operating unit and the company to solve the problem.<br />e. The minimum needs of the government for data and data rights have been detennined according<br />to DFARS 227.71. No technical data will be purchased or generated by contracts awarded under the<br />authority of this J&amp;A. Only services and related travel support costs, as defined and approved under<br />the procedures set forth in AFI 21-110, can be purchased under the authority ofthis J&amp;A.<br />x. Interested Sources<br />The prime manufacturers of the equipment/weapon systems are the only designated sources. The<br />services will be solicited from the designated sources in accordance with the policies and procedures<br />in AFI21-110.<br />XI. Steps to Foster Competition<br />The expertise required to provide CETS on a specified piece of equipment or weapon system is not<br />normally available from other than the prime manufacturer. As the equipment/weapon system remains<br />in the AF inventory, the possibility of the AF having trained personnel experienced on the contractor's<br />equipment increases. This organic capability will result in the contracted services being eliminated.<br />Ot:her than organic capability, obtaining open competition is not practical due to the constant changes<br />in the equipment/weapon system and lack of updated technical data being readily available.<br />X.II.

Program Activity: All Air Force (AF) commands are directed to manage their individual<br />Contracting Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) requirements under AFI 21-110 guidelines.<br />II. Description Of Action<br />a. This Class J&amp;A covers contractual actions for CETS to be awarded for FY08-FYI O. The CETS<br />will be acquired to support the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, the Air National Guard (ANG) and<br />possibly the Coast Guard tor various weapon systems/subsystems/equipment located at operational<br />AF, Al'-.J"G, MIUY, Nav-y and Coast Guard instaiiations.<br />b. The CETS requirements are establishcd in HAF-ILM(A)7150 report (or its equivalent) at HQ<br />USAFIILMM. The total estimated number of contracts to be awarded for the 3 years (FY08-FYIO) is<br />20-30, for a total estimated amount obligated of $73.875M. Cost estimates for the FY08-10 contracts<br />are based upon current negotiated prices with cost increases expected in the consumer price index<br />(CPI) range except in the unknown cases of major restructures or company mergers. A<br />10 percent escalation factor to allow for an additional surge in requirements was applied to the<br />projections obtained from the commands to arrive at the total estimated amount. Contracts will be<br />awarded and task orders issued, only after corresponding FY HAF-ILM(A)7150 requirements have<br />been validated by HQ USAFIILMM and commands have issued purchase request packages to<br />ASCIPKWRN. The cxact number of contracts/task orders and estimated amounts cannot be precisely<br />determined as commands are continually eliminating and adding CETS representatives, at their<br />respective bases, each fiscal year as requirements materialize.<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />2<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONL"" (<br />c. The CETS supports such weapon systems as F-22 NC, F-16 NC, F-15 NC, KC-135 NC and<br />A-IO NC. See attachment for all known weapon systems/equipment requiring CETS support, with<br />associated contractors and estimated dollar amount by command. All AF activities that have CETS<br />requirements must submit, on an annual basis, their HAF-ILM(A)7150 (or its equivalent) to<br />HQ USAF/ILMM. This report includes precise narrative justifications for each CETS requirement<br />including a list of the prime contractors. In accordance with AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical<br />Services, HQ USAF/ILMM reviews and validates these requirements on an annual basis. HQ<br />USAF/lLMM maintains these reports.<br />d. All of the CETS contractors are Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The OEMs have<br />successfully provided engineering and technical support over the past 30 years. They will continue to<br />do so because the success of their CETS program ensures a continued AF market for their weapon<br />systems/equipment and spare parts. The CETS OEMs place highly trained persolUlel in the field to<br />train AF maintenance tearns. The AF persolUlel continually evaluate, through weapon system and<br />team performance, the quality of service these CETS personnel provide. Since a majority ofCETS<br />contracts are follow-on, the technical capabilities of the CETS persolUlel have already been validated.<br />e. History has shown the CETS program will continue to be required by most AF commands. The<br />AF persolUlel turnover, coupled with new weapon introductions and current system modifications,<br />have been the driving force in this continuation. There is reasonable certainty that funds will be made<br />available for these fiscal years.<br />f. Contract Features: Contracts will generally be awarded in September-December timeframe<br />prior to the start of each year of performance. Contracts are written as requirement task order, service<br />type contracts. Each basic contract is usually 2-3 years in length. Based on historical data within<br />ASCIPKWRN, this is the maximum time contractors are willing to project costs for negotiations<br />because of unknown business base fluctuations affecting overhead pools (10 U.S.c. 2304b limits the<br />ordering period of anMAS task order contract to 5 years). Most actions will be awarded as new<br />contracts, with only a few modifications to existing contracts to extend services for a period oftirne.<br />The CETS contracts/task orders utilize fixed price man-month or man-day type contracts with cost<br />reimbursement CLINs for personnel support expenditures such as official travel and in some instances,<br />relocations. All CETS contracts are awarded in accordance with AFI 21-110 and are categorized as<br />non operational other contracting as defined in the Air Force FAR Supplement 5302.10 I.<br />III. Description of Supplies/Services<br />Narrative Description - The CETS program is the medium through which AF units use contractor<br />personnel, usually on a man-month basis, to provide on-site proficiency training, technical advice and<br />technical assistance for initial system bed down when organic skills are not available. As such, the AF<br />acquires specialized, technical nonpersonal services that are essential in accomplishing the assigned<br />mission of the equipment and/or weapon systems. The CETS contracts provide a method by which the<br />contractor can provide information to the using command on new and/or complex equipment and<br />weapon systems in the AF inventory. The CETS contracts also encompass on-the-job training ofAF<br />maintenance persolUlel by employees of the prime contractor. The CETS representative's main duties<br />consist ofthe following:<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />3<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />Give on-site technical advice and hands-on training on all aspects of equipment<br />maintenance and operations including modifications and retrofits<br />Advise and train on special tools, handling equipment, test equipment, and other<br />related items<br />Comply with and emphasize safety precautions<br />Provide maintenance and operational information from the manufacturer<br />Assist in mishap investigations and failure data reporting<br />Perform direct maintenance only under unusual or emergency circumstances<br />a. The AF CETS program is covered by this Class J&amp;A for all FY08-FYIO contractual actions.<br />b. Total estimated value of the efforts contemplated in this J&amp;A is $73.875M.<br />IV. Authority<br />The statutory authority which permits other than full and open competition for this class of<br />contract actions is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). In the case of each<br />individual contract, there is only one responsible source, and no other services will satisfy agency<br />re quirements.<br />V.

The OEM contractor also provides critical, updated<br />technical data to the CETS representatives in the field. Furthermore, the expertise ofthe OEM<br />contractor's research, development, manufacturing, and administrative teams, buoyed by the learning<br />curve effect ofthe manufacturing redesigning, modification and refining process, is not available<br />outside the original equipment manufacturer. Only CETS support contracts have the ability to reach<br />any specific expert at any time. The AF lacks the expert resources and data necessary to establish an<br />organic capability for these services when weapon systems/equipment or modifications thereto are<br />initially fielded. The services are contracted from the manufacturer ofthe equipment or weapon<br />systems in accordance with the policies and procedures in AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical<br />Services. However, if this expertise should become available from sources other than the OEM,<br />competition will be attempted. The OEMs are designated as sole source for CETS provided in support<br />of AF major subdivisions such as AFMC, AFSOC, AFRC, AETC, AMC, AFRC, PACAF, ACe,<br />USAFE, AFSPC and the Air National Guard. Due to the fact that technical data and expertise are not<br />available except from the OEMs, award to any other source would result in unacceptable training for<br />our AF maintenance teams and a critical increase in weapon systems downtime. Based on the reasons<br />stated previously, it is also likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication<br />of costs as a result ofrequired reverse engineering. These costs would not likely be recovered through<br />competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements.<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />4<br />.( FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY. i<br />VI. Efforts to Obtain Competition<br />A presolicitation synopsis was published on I Dec 06 in the FedBizOpps following coordination<br />with the Small Business Office. No sources have formally responded to the synopsis. A prior<br />synopsis, for the FY05-FY07 program, also did not produce any new sources. Individual contract<br />synopses published over the past 3 years have not produced any new qualified sources. All CETS<br />basic contracts, that meet the criteria set forth in FAR 5.3, will be synopsized in an individual Notice<br />of Contract Action.<br />VII. Fair and Reasonable Costs<br />All proposed program costs will be thoroughly analyzed in the performance ofeach contract<br />action. Contractors will be required to submit cost or pricing data to support the government's<br />evaluation of the proposed cost/price (in accordance with TINA threshold). Technical evaluation will<br />be provided through the buying activity program managers and audit assistance from the Defense<br />Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). This information will provide the contracting officer with adequate<br />knowledge to determine a fair and reasonable price/cost.<br />VIII. Market Research<br />The market survey for the FY08-FYI 0 program consisted ofthe publication ofa presolicitation<br />synopsis placed in the FedBizOpps. It was published on I Dec 06 as noted in paragraph VI. A couple<br />of sources informally made telephone inquiries, but after further discussion with them, they did not<br />feel they could meet the basic requirements ofthe CETS program. Furthermore, market research for<br />CETS over the past 30 years has not generated any successful new sources other than the OEMs.<br />IX. Other Facts<br />a. The requirements activities' experience have been that the various commands that CETS<br />supports have contracted for Interim Contract Support (ICS) company personnel to support the USAF<br />because Technical Data is late-to-need when the system is delivered. The new systems are so<br />intensive with computer driven devices that hardware/software changes are typically late-to-need. The<br />manufacturer normally has the task of maintaining the technical data/software baseline for the USAF.<br />Until the total engineering support is transferred to the responsible Air Logistics Center (ALe), the<br />manufacturer has the only master file of current technical data.<br />b. There are many components and hardware support items that are coded weapon system<br />peculiar. The manufacturer has the specification data to cross-reference these items and provide<br />alternative part numbers and specification numbers that can be substituted for installation on a<br />component. As the weapon systern matures, the AF develops the cross-reference tables at the ALC's<br />and provides adequate support. This support is critical until in-house capabilities are developed.<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />5<br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />c. Procurement of engineering drawings from the prime contractor (OEM) is often lengthy and<br />time consuming. Frequently, the OEM contractor can supply the drawings through their CETS<br />representatives within hours, thus enhancing the operating commands ability to make a major decision<br />that affects the safe operations of very expensive weapon systems during combat situations. There are<br />times when the ALC will have to go to a manufacturer for drawing support because the center does not<br />have the workforce to support a request. Having the CETS representative available eliminates this<br />time consuming procedure and increases the operational rate ofwarfighting systems.<br />d. The commands' statements of work will define all requirements to deliver a full-up operational<br />weapons system to a combat unit. Frequently during the process of production, modifications/changes<br />are made that affect the end product causing a shortfall in technical data, software and hardware for<br />sub-systems when the initial system is fielded. The CETS representatives are often the only link<br />between an operating unit and the company to solve the problem.<br />e. The minimum needs of the government for data and data rights have been detennined according<br />to DFARS 227.71. No technical data will be purchased or generated by contracts awarded under the<br />authority of this J&amp;A. Only services and related travel support costs, as defined and approved under<br />the procedures set forth in AFI 21-110, can be purchased under the authority ofthis J&amp;A.<br />x. Interested Sources<br />The prime manufacturers of the equipment/weapon systems are the only designated sources. The<br />services will be solicited from the designated sources in accordance with the policies and procedures<br />in AFI21-110.<br />XI. Steps to Foster Competition<br />The expertise required to provide CETS on a specified piece of equipment or weapon system is not<br />normally available from other than the prime manufacturer. As the equipment/weapon system remains<br />in the AF inventory, the possibility of the AF having trained personnel experienced on the contractor's<br />equipment increases. This organic capability will result in the contracted services being eliminated.<br />Ot:her than organic capability, obtaining open competition is not practical due to the constant changes<br />in the equipment/weapon system and lack of updated technical data being readily available.<br />X.II.

<DESC>The Integrated Sensor Is Structure (ISIS) Program is developing a sub-scale Demonstration System radar of unprecedented proportions that is fully integrated into a station-keeping stratospheric airship.  The ISIS Objective System performance supports the nation’s need for persistent wide-area surveillance, tracking, and engagement of all time-critical air and ground targets.  Automated surveillance and tracking includes all air targets to the radar horizon of 600 km and all ground targets to a range of 300 km.  The radar aperture also provides track data and other communications directly to users in-theater.

Follow up award to Notice of Intent for AG-82X9-S-09-0094.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.3)

1.  Contracting Agency and Activity. 
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) United States Forest Service (USFS) Rocky Mountain Regional Office External Affairs Staff through the Central Tier Group of the RO AQM plans to contract by means other than full and open competition. This document sets forth the justification and approval for use of two exceptions to full and open competition allowed under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984.
2.  Nature of Action Being Approved.  
This action entails assisting the USFS Rocky Mountain Region in transformation of up to 11 individual National Forest Internet sites within the Region (Region 2) from the existing Web architecture/template to the new standard portal as mandated by the U.S. Forest Service. A key aspect of this project is to work closely with the USFS employees who maintain their respective Web sites to enable them to become self sufficient in working with the new Web portal. The mandated deadline for the complete transformation of all sites to occur is March 1, 2010. 
3.  Description of Supplies or Services. 
The requiring program office is USDA USFS Rocky Mountain Regional Office External Affairs Staff.
The service involves assisting up to 11 Region 2 National Forest and Grassland units and the Rocky Mountain Regional Office in migrating their Web site presence from the current template on the USFS Legacy servers to the new template within the new USDA portal environment. Work includes assisting with completing necessary information architecture spreadsheets, cleaning up the ensuing development site in preparation for making it live to the public, and training those, as needed, who will manage the Web sites following successful migration.  
The intent is for a requirements contract where work will be based on a delivery or task order basis with effective period of the contract from award to March 1, 2010.
4.  Estimated Dollar Value.  
The estimated dollar value ranges from $30,000 not to exceed $100,000 (the Simplified Acquisition Threshold). The variance in estimate is due to uncertain status of all the sites within Region 2 as to their exact needs. Ascertaining these exact needs is problematic due to the centralization of many of the supporting positions involved in local Forest Internet Site management that in many cases has resulted in Web site maintenance becoming  a secondary duty. Some Forests may require minimal technical assistance while some may require more thorough assistance. This phenomenon is due to the variant nature of the skill, experience, and workload levels of the resident Forest Web Managers as well as some Forests not having a resident Web Manager but relying on other Forests to cover their sites. There is a high degree of variability in the “quality” or “attention” some of Forest Internet sites have received, making the determination of their exact needs problematic.
5.  Statutory Authority. 
Two FAR authorities are cited as the services needed inter-mix with both of them.
6.302-2  Unusual and compelling urgency. 
(a) Authority. 
(1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2). 
(2) When the agency’s need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for. 
(b) Application. This authority applies in those situations where— 
(1) An unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition; and 
(2) Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government. 
(c) Limitations. 
(1) Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by the written justifications and approvals described in 6.303 and 6.304. These justifications may be made and approved after contract award when preparation and approval prior to award would unreasonably delay the acquisition. 
(2) This statutory authority requires that agencies shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances. 
6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
(a) Authority. 
(1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). 
(2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. 
B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)
6.  Rationale Supporting Use of Citation(s) in No. 5.  
Unusual and compelling urgency exists with this project. The USDA has become increasingly concerned about the security of the USFS Legacy servers. Indeed, in mid-April 2009, a major mal-ware attack prompted the servers to be shut down for over a week while mitigation and security containment measures were taken. In November 2008, the U.S. Forest Service Business Operations notified the Rocky Mountain Regional Office that the Legacy servers on which our Web sites currently reside would be decommissioned in 20 months, which would have meant July 2010. In late March 2009, the Rocky Mountain Region learned the agency’s public-facing Web server (www.fs.fed.us) is slated to be decommissioned on March 1, 2010, shortening the time available for migration to the new portal by five months. Because many of the Rocky Mountain Region’s Forests will need a assistance to complete the migration to the new portal environment and it is critical to have consistency across the Region’s Web sites, the process to finish all 11 Web sites must begin now.  

Michelle Munroe of System 2 has a 20-year background in information technology including technical support, client/server, Internet technologies and high-end development including Content Management, Database Integration, Design Portals, Migration, On-line and On-site training, Infrastructure Development, and Security.  These facts alone do not and cannot stand alone in support of this justification.

The justifications, detailed below, are the present, immediate disposition of System 2 in relation to the USFS needs for the services and the unusual and compelling urgency of the work required.

The key factors in justifying this action are System 2’s nine-year work history with the United States Forest Service network, Internet, and systems. Ms. Munroe worked on a Webmaster team for 2003 wildfires for a five-state region; developed and trained staff on a new dynamic Web template; and trained staff on Web development and design, IT, and Internet security. She worked with a team to develop the Forest Service Job Corps Web site and re-designed the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center Web site. She is developing Web sites for the U.S. Forest Service Partnership with the National Get Outdoors Day and Colorado Kids Outdoors.org and has used the portal template needed to complete the work for this contract.

Ms. Munroe’s expertise in, experience with, and high performance with Web site issues of the Rocky Mountain Region coupled with her nearby physical location, ongoing professional relationships with the clients based on her work with U.S. Forest Service Internet site projects previously cited, and availability to begin the project immediately upon award make her the choice to support the U.S. Forest Service’s mission in the assistance of getting the Web sites transformed. Time is of the essence with this project because the servers on which the Rocky Mountain Region’s current Web sites reside will be decommissioned on March 1, 2010. Failure to meet this deadline will not only reflect badly on the U.S. Forest Service but more importantly will adversely affect our external customers and public. Taxpayers will have serious interruptions and degradations of services and information accessed through the Forest Internet sites.

The Rocky Mountain Region intends for this contract to cover the minimal needs of basic migration assistance to the new Web portal whilst concurrently empowering the USFS employees associated with the Web sites to be self sufficient. The contractor will essentially be performing work that will reduce the need for such work as it progresses, and the USFS Web persons involved will become empowered with these capabilities. 

Ancillary work not essential to the basic migration and empowerment of existing USFS Webmaster of sanguine items associated with this project will be done in-house by the Forest Service, or if further contracting of like services is planned, and the key word here is planned, as required per FAR 7 Acquisition Plans, which the head of the agency is required to follow, the process will include normal competitive procedures.

7.  The Efforts to Identify Additional Sources Including the Market Research Conducted.
A notice of intent to sole source was posted, per FAR 5.201 on FedBizOpps on April 6th, 2009.  It stated that sources may submit descriptive literature, full(y) documenting their capability to perform these services. FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements) was utilized as basis for the notice.  
FAR 6.302-2* (Unusual and compelling urgency) was not utilized initially as the extent of the urgency was not as comprehensively known at the time of the initial post of the Notice of Intent,  thus precluding the posting of a notice on FedBizOpps.  
5.202  Exceptions. 
The contracting officer need not submit the notice required by 5.201 when— 
(a) The contracting officer determines that— 
(1) The synopsis cannot be worded to preclude disclosure of an agency’s needs and such disclosure would compromise the national security (e.g., would result in disclosure of classified information). The fact that a proposed solicitation or contract action contains classified information, or that access to classified matter may be necessary to submit a proposal or perform the contract does not, in itself, justify use of this exception to synopsis; 
(2) The proposed contract action is made under the conditions described in 6.302-2* (or, for purchases conducted using simplified acquisition procedures, if unusual and compelling urgency precludes competition to the maximum extent practicable) and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in 5.203; 
(3) The proposed contract action is one for which either the written direction of a foreign government reimbursing the agency for the cost of the acquisition of the supplies or services for such government, or the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the United States and a foreign government, or international organizations, has the effect of requiring that the acquisition shall be from specified sources; 
It was determined to publish the notice anyway under FAR 6.302.1 to ascertain, with the urgent need still in mind but not to the extent that was revealed later, what potential sources were practicable given the circumstances but primarily to openly address, with the intent of FAR Part 5, Publication of Contract Actions, increased competition for future related actions and to broaden future industry participation through awareness of such needs.
The following firms submitted responses to notice:
Crystal Clear Industries, Inc. - Albuquerque, New Mexico
Musewerx, Inc. - East Brunswick, New Jersey
Eumotif, Inc. - Phoenix, Arizona
Norristown Data Processing  (DBA) The Dekalb Group, a sole proprietorship – Norristown, Pennsylvania and Parker, Colorado
8.  Future Plans to Permit Competition. 
Action to increase future competition is not required because there are no planned acquisitions for or related to this requirement, and none are likely to develop. (per the USFS project persons in charge of the requirement.)  However, any such further actions of this nature that are contemplated to occur will have every effort applied to be competed if acquisition of the services is considered with emphasis on acquisition planning. 
9.  Recommendation and Certification from Program Office. 
Based on the above, I recommend this acquisition be conducted on the basis of other than full and open competition.  I certify that technical data that forms a basis for this justification, which are the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel, are complete and accurate.

<DESC>NOTE: This justification references, in part, the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA); however, ARRA funds have not yet been made available for obligation purposes.  Therefore, non-ARRA funds have been obligated for the base period of this contract.

This justification is being posted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.305.

-----

(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a “Justification for other than full and open competition.” / U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. / This is a justification for a limited competition between as many potential sources as practicable under the circumstances under the authority cited in section (4) below for the services described in (3) below.  This acquisition involves requesting offers from the seven potential sources listed in (10) below.

(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value). / Under Title XIII, Section 1305 of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has “primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of smart grid devices and systems…”  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”) (signed February 17, 2009) provided funding to support the implementation of Section 1305 of EISA (through the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE)); this contract represents a portion of that effort.

NIST requires the rapid development of an Interim Roadmap with the maximum amount of consensus as practicable and possible among Smart Grid stakeholders, including those identified in EISA, to be delivered no later than May 28, 2009 to allow review, approval and transmittal by June 2009 to appropriate parties such as the U. S. Congress, the DOE including the Secretary of Energy, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  An accelerated deadline for the interim roadmap, which will be developed under this contract, is intended to minimize the risk to the Federal Government and private sector stakeholders utilizing the Smart Grid matching grants funds from the DOE.  This program requires that standards resulting from the NIST-coordinated interoperability framework be used as criteria for award of grants by the DOE.  The earlier those standards are adopted, the less risk to investments made by the Government and the private sector for the grants program.  This roadmap is important to the interoperability framework required by EISA 2007, which also requires coordination with DOE and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

The Interim Roadmap provided under this contract shall be a document that describes the high-level Smart Grid architecture, principles and interface design; describes the current status, issues and priorities for interoperability standards development and harmonization; and includes an action plan that addresses these issues.  The contract will also include an option period of approximately forty-five days for the delivery of a consensus agreement document by August 15, 2009 identifying responsible (private-sector) entities for standards development and harmonization with a summary of unresolved issues.  The Government’s estimated value of the required services is approximately $1,200,000 ($800,000 Base Period and $400,000 Option Period).

(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. / 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2) (FAR Subpart 6.302-2).

(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. / The ARRA was enacted February 17, 2009 to address urgent national needs; a critical component supported by significant ARRA funding (over $4.5 billion) is to upgrade our Nation’s electric grid to produce the “Smart Grid” as described in EISA.  There is joint Obama Administration/Presidential and Congressional agreement on the urgency of this need to build the Smart Grid, and that as a critical part of this effort NIST must now accelerate the development of a framework to achieve interoperability of Smart Grid devices and systems.  Standards create stability that mitigates the risk of having equipment purchased and implemented that is not able to interoperate and unable to be upgradeable to remedy its shortcomings, with the result that it must be entirely replaced to be compatible with other equipment as the Smart Grid is developed (i.e., “stranded investment”).  The standards roadmap will identify existing standards and those that need to be developed or harmonized to establish the stable basis for Smart Grid devices and systems.  This action is required to reduce the risk of wasting substantial investment using ARRA funding and an equal or greater investment by the private sector in the Smart Grid.

The Secretary of the DOE and the Deputy Director of NIST, as well as many other government and industry leaders, have spoken directly on the urgent need to greatly accelerate the development of Smart Grid interoperability standards and roadmaps, with required timescales on the order of weeks to months instead of months to years.  At a March 3, 2009 hearing, the members of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources urged that rapid progress be made to address interoperability standards issues; the Deputy Director of NIST affirmed NIST’s commitment to provide an interim standards roadmap by summer (June 2009).  The urgency and short timeline exceed NIST’s ability to produce this interim roadmap with existing staff, requiring that this short-term contract be awarded by the beginning of April to provide sufficient time and resources to produce the Interim Roadmap to meet this urgent national need.

Included in this contract is an option period to produce the required consensus agreement document by August 15, 2009 to accelerate standards development and harmonization by identifying responsible (private-sector) entities and a summary of unresolved issues.

If normal, unrestricted full and open competitive procedures that involve publicizing and response times set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5 for negotiated acquisitions were used, the award timeline of this contract would be at two to three months (fifteen days to advertise an acquisition in FedBizOpps, at least thirty days for potential offerors to submit a proposal, an appropriate time for the Government to evaluate proposals, and an appropriate time for internal agency reviews before an award decision is made) and would prevent the Interim Roadmap from being delivered in time to meet NIST’s deadlines and commitments to Congress. 

With respect to qualifications to deliver an Interoperability Roadmap by the required date, it is critical that the contractor possess the required technical expertise, capabilities and associated experience in roadmap and Smart Grid standards development and harmonization to be able to develop, describe and implement a solid technical approach and plan. The contractor must also demonstrate experience providing similar services including interacting with broad stakeholder communities, to produce deliverables by required times. 

(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. / Due to the urgent requirement to complete the Interim Roadmap no later than May 28, 2009, the entire acquisition milestones process, including market research, has been significantly accelerated.  Using the qualification criteria described in section (5) above, NIST searched the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search Database and found no small businesses that met these criteria.  NIST engaged in additional market research effort that included (a) identifying potential qualified sources based on input from experts at NIST, DOE and others, and (b) calling those sources to verify that they potentially met the criteria described in section (5). From this, a list of seven potential sources was developed, and a solicitation notice was sent to these sources.

(7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. / The Contracting Officer performed price analysis and cost realism analysis before award and determined that the price for the selected Contractor is fair and reasonable.

(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. / For a description of the market research conducted, see (6) above.

(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. / Prior to ARRA (signed February 17, 2009), no designated funding had been appropriated to implement Title XIII, section 1305 of EISA such that the NIST effort initiated in January 2008 was limited to reassignment of existing internal staff, utilizing volunteer support from outside industry experts, and obtaining support from the DOE to attempt to meet expectations consistent with EISA’s 5 year authorization profile.  NIST also redirected FY2008 and FY 2009 base funding to a contract with RJ Beck/Plexus to support EISA activities.  The urgency of this project was established by the Obama Administration and facilitated by the availability of ARRA funding considerably larger than authorized by EISA 2007, intended to accelerate the project.  NIST became aware of this urgent need at the end of February into the first week of March, and did not have sufficient time to utilize the normal publicizing and response time requirements as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5 for negotiated non-commercial acquisitions.

Advertising this acquisition for fifteen days as normally required and leaving the solicitation out for at least thirty days would have a significant adverse impact on NIST being able to acquire the deliverables by the required timeframes  Specifically, there exists the following factors: the need for the contract deliverables to be in place in order to mitigate the significant risk of stranded investment under the DOE’s administration of over $4.5 billion of its ARRA funds, and the need for NIST to disperse in a timely manner the ARRA funds allocated for this contract, as required under that statute.   Failure for NIST to receive the contract deliverables by the May 28, 2009 deadline would result in NIST being unable to meet the requirements of EISA under the urgent timeframe as indicated by both the U. S. Congress and the Obama Administration, and ARRA.

(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. / 
No sources expressed in writing an interest in the acquisition prior to the solicitation.  The following sources participated in a preproposal conference call held on March 17, 2009:

(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  

The follow-on acquisition to this acquisition will involve appropriate market research to determine the applicable acquisition strategy, and the NIST Competition Advocate will review the acquisition strategy before NIST proceeds to solicit for the follow-on acquisition.  After the appropriate acquisition strategy is determined, a presolicitation notice for the follow-on acquisition will be advertised in the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov at least fifteen days before the solicitation is posted on that website.  

(12) The contracting officer certificatiies that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer’s knowledge and belief.
