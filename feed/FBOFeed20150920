<a href="mailto:denise.l.richardson4.mil@mail.mil">MICC - Fort Gordon</a>
<DESC>Mission and Installation Contracting Command, Fort Gordon, Georgia (MICC-Fort Gordon) has a requirement for the WAVE system.  The WAVE system is designed to effectively communicate and collaborate through voice and data - securely, reliably and in real-time - regardless of network, carrier, protocol or device whether deployed on premise or in the cloud. The dispatch center will be able to extend the reach of radio users beyond the radio system, enabling connectivity to broadband networks and other radio systems.  The WAVE system will enable on-scene communications with partner agencies using a donor radio from the partner agency. The system will provide dispatch capabilities at the incident trailer using the LMR system, patch talk groups, monitor channels, and record communications for after action reporting. The system will allow for communications between phone users and radio users.  Additionally, the WAVE system will allow for critical, time-sensitive information to be delivered between emergency operations personnel in the field or in the office.  The equipment will be required for installation at the Directorate of Emergency Services (DES) that performs Dispatch Operations 24/7/365. The NAICS code for this requirement 334220.   <br>  <br> MICC-Fort Gordon intends to purchase the items from 4K Solutions, LLC, 11255 Rambling Trail, Midland, GA 31820 on a sole source basis. <br>  <br> Motorola Solutions is solely compatible with Fort Gordon's existing Land Mobile Radio (LMR). 4K Solutions has been directly involved in the creation of this solution and has unique and critical knowledge of the Government's requirement and the complexity involved with integration of WAVE technology into the Emergency Response Directorates infrastructure and operations.  4K Solutions is an authorized partner of Motorola Solutions WAVE value added reseller, system integrator and training partner.  4K Solutions is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).   <br>  <br> A determination not to compete this requirement was made pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c) (1), only one responsible Source. The Government intends to procure this sole source requirement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in FAR part 13 and Commercial procedures in FAR part 12. <br>  <br> THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS and a solicitation will not be issued. Interested concerns must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this requirement would be advantageous to the Government. <br>  <br> If no affirmative written responses are received by 24 September 2015 at 10:00am EST, award will be made without further notice. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the government.

HF Radio spans the frequency band from 3 MHz - 30 MHz and is used primary for medium range (10km-80km miles) and long range (500km-3000km). During Hurricane season 1 June - 30 November, the VING is required to conduct weekly HF communications checks with the National Guard Bureau in Arlington, Virginia which is approximately 2500km NW from the Joint Force Headquarters located on St. Croix. The VING also conducts weekly HF checks with Task Force Bravo and VITEMA located on St. Thomas which is 60 km N from the JFHQ-VI. Other VING sites identified to use HF Radio are Task Force Alpha and Army Aviation, both located on St. Croix.</p>
<p>The National Guard Bureau provides licensed software for the HF Radio programming AND for digital messaging from Harris Corporation. The Harris Corporation radio programming application (RPA v6.3) is required to transfer the radio settings and subscribers (54 total) from a laptop to the Harris Radio.

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE

The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 6, in support of the Durham VA Medical Center intends to enter into a sole source procurement with Ortho Clinical Diagnostics for blood bank reagents to be used on Ortho Clinical Diagnostics machine.  The primary objective of this procurement is to establish a requirements contract for a base and four years to provide reagents on an as needed basis.
NAICS code 325413 applies to this procurement.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations.  However, interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability, to include proof of distributorship of specified brand-name-only item(s) in providing the same product. Responses can be submitted to john.summers2@va.gov.  Responses received by 3:00 pm on September 21, 2015 will be considered.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. 
No solicitation will be made available for this procurement.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.
?
JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
558-16-1-044-0022	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
