<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Macrogen Corporation, 1330 Piccard Drive, Suite 205, Rockville, Maryland 20850 to procure the following for NHGRI Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP):</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement:</span></p>
<p>This is a Follow-On Requirement.</p>
<p>1. Plasmid Sequencing, Item Number: FS001, Quantity: Number of UDP Samples will be provided upon award.<br />2. 1 Primer/1 Plate (96-Well), Item Number: FS003, Quantity Number: UDP Samples will be provided upon award.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:</span></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objectives:</span></p>
<p>The NIH UDP uses an innovative paradigm for selecting patients (based upon potential for representing a new disease), for phenotyping (extensive multidisciplinary investigations at no cost to the patient), performing genetic studies (combined SNP and WES analysis using family members and filtering programs developed in house). Specific areas of interest include techniques for studying dominant inheritance and identifying families that are most likely to generate verifiable sequence variants as a result of NGS applied as an agnostic, diagnostic screen for genetic disease. Sequence variants identified by NGS are verified by Sanger sequencing following PCR amplification of the regions predicted by NGS to contain said variants. Based on the reagent, maintenance and personnel costs for in house sequencing, the UDP laboratory contracts out the Sanger sequencing of said PCR products to achieve economies of scale and maintain high quality results.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance</span>:</p>
<p>6-8 Weeks upon Award</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JUSTIFICATION</span>:<br /><br />Macrogen Corporation has been providing sequencing service for the Undiagnosed Diseases Laboratory for the past two years. Macrogen offers same day free pick up from the laboratory, a 24-hour turnaround time for results, and high quality data return. It is necessary for the Undiagnosed Disease Laboratory to retain the sequencing service provided by Macrogen in order to maintain experimental consistency and to avoid delays incurred by re- optimization of experimental design, bioinformatics testing and redesign, and restructuring the laboratory database that is already in use. The quality of the responsiveness and quality of the service that Macrogen continues to provide to NHGRI/UDP continues to be excellent.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY AUTHORITY:</span></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</span></p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, with a business size standard of 500. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant Contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-72 (January 1, 2014). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov." A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by January 24, 2014 and must reference synopsis number HHS-NIH-NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2014-051-DLM, may be submitted to the National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell. Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative. "All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency."</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent for sole source procurement of maintenance, development, updates, and support of existing USGS software development for USGS Land Use Land Cover (LULC) Studies.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) Geologic Division, Menlo Park, CA, requires continued support in the maintenance, development, updates, and support of existing software packages used to create a prototype Land Use Land Cover (LULC) carbon model, as a proof-of-concept, building on USGS spatial LULC modeling currently underway.  The USGS in conjunction with the US Forrest Service, The Nature Conservatory, and LANDFIRE Project, developed State-and Transaction Simulation Models (STSMs) designed to predict how vegetation will change across a landscape over time in response to interactions between succession, distribution, and management. To that effect, the USGS intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Apex Resource Management, Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  Concerns responding to this pre-solicitation must furnish concise responses directly to the requirements mentioned above and are invited to submit capability statements no later than the closing date of the announcement.  Responses must include complete description of services to be provided and contain sufficient technical information to allow agency analysis to establish bona fide capabilities. Submissions will include specific samples of STSMs and other vital software packages, may be sent to the Contracting Officer at sevans@usgs.gov.  RFQ G14PS00120 will be posted on or about 21 January 2014 and may be requested from the Contract Specialist.

<CONTACT>Kim Marie Beard, Contract Specialist, Phone 3128465378, Fax 3128865475, Email Kim.M.Beard@usace.army.mil - Regina G. Blair, Chief, Contracting Branch, Phone 312-846-5371, Fax 312-886-5475, Email regina.g.blair@usace.army.mil
<DESC>Planned sole source follow-on contract to provide operations and maintenance services at the Chicago Harbor Lock facility located at the confluence of the main branch of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan in Chicago, Illinois.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
<p><br /><br />The government intends to award a sole source follow-on contract to its incumbent Contractor, ABM GOVERNMENT SERVICES, LLC, to continue the critical operations which will ensure uninterrupted lock operations until the government transitions federal employees into the existing contracted positions. The follow-on contract that requires Level 1, Full Service Lock Operations 24/7/365 will be firm-fixed price, with a performance period of 5 months.</p>
<p>The highly skilled and qualified staff of the incumbent Contractor, ABM, has been successfully performing the Lock Operations and maintenance for over 4 years. They have been providing services for this Harbor Lock with the highest, single chamber traffic volume in the nation. ABM has in depth knowledge and the technical on ground staff necessary to maintain the continuity of lock operations which is vitally important in consideration of this lock being equipped with two sets of opposing sector gates that operate against an average head of one to four feet, and with its chamber being 600 feet long by 80 feet wide capable of locking vessels drafting up to 22 feet.</p>
<p>ABM operates the Lock 24 hours per day annually. In 2012, it safely and competently managed this operation where approximately 10,500 lockages were made to pass 34,000 vessels and 41 kilotons of commodities through its chamber. Additionally, ABM has demonstrated its ability to provide excellent service during the Chicago Harbor lock's peak period of vessel traffic, which occurs from May through October. During this period, ABM has smoothly operated the lock receiving approximately 96 percent of its annual vessel traffic and where it has performed approximately 88 percent of the lock's annual lockages.</p>
<p><br />With almost 50 years of providing expert facility and support services for government entities, ABM has decades of experience of serving the government, and understands the mission of these critical support services. They have been a reliable Contractor providing cost effectiveness in this project.</p>
<p>In consideration of FAR 6.302 1(a)(2)(iii)(a) and (b), the services being planned are available only from the original source for the continued provision of highly specialized services as it is likely that an award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and potentially cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling of the agency's requirements for this operation that is required to be manned 24/7/365.</p>
<p><br />Please submit your interest in response to this Notice, and a description of your capabilities and past experiences to perform these requirements. This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. The government does not intend to pay for information received. All interested parties must respond within fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice. Written responses must provide clear and concise documentation indicating your firm's capability to provide the required services. Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered. When responding to this announcement, respondents should refer to FBO announcement W912P6-14-R-0011. If no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement by 4:30 P.M. CDT on 1 February 2014, the Chicago District will negotiate solely with ABM for the aforementioned services. The point of contact is Kim Beard at (312) 846-5378.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a Pre-Solicitation Notice for Emergency Streambank Protection along the Connecticut River. <br> The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 - $5,000,000. <br>  <br> The proposed project will restore approximately 1300 feet of riverbank along the Connecticut River in Middletown, Connecticut along the eastern side of the John S. Roth Well Field on River Road. The purpose of the project is to stabilize the shoreline, and prevent further erosion of the riverbank. The project will be constructed under the special continuing authority contained in Section 14 of the 1946 Flood Control Act (as amended). This project will be constructed in partnership with a local, non-Federal sponsor (the City of Middletown), and when completed will be turned over to the sponsor. <br>  <br> The construction project will consist of a stone toe along the bank below the water surface which will be buried, and then a layer stone revetment leading up the slope at which point the revetment will become recessed and covered with a layer of topsoil. The stone revetment will be placed only along selected locations of the bank, leaving approximately 30% of the existing floodplain forest intact. Stone protection that will be placed along the bank immediately adjacent to the well field will rest at an approximate 1:2 Vertical to Horizontal slope, which will become embedded, and covered with topsoil. The topsoil will then be planted with native vegetation which will extend to the crest of the slope. The upper crest of the slope will then be planted with native trees. In addition, a series of bendway weirs are planned to be placed at the base of the lower bank within the intertidal area adjacent to the flow of the river. <br>  <br> This will not be a continuing contract. This is not a request for proposals at this time. The solicitation requirements and contract documents, including instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about August 20, 2013. Telephonic, mailed, and faxed requests for hard copies of the solicitation will not be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online. In order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov).

<DESC>THE BELOW DESCRIPTION PROVIDES AN INTRODUCTION ONLY; REFER TO THE ATTACHMENT FOR THE FULL ANNOUNCEMENT. <br>  <br> Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) Sources Sought  <br>  <br> This is a request for candidates for the 15.1 NIE, Oct-Nov 2014.  <br>  <br> Key words: NIE, Agile Process <br>  <br> 1. DESCRIPTION <br>  <br> 1.1 The US Army ASA(ALT) System of Systems Engineering and Integration Directorate (hereinafter referred to as SOSE&I) is seeking interested sources with mature solutions to enhance existing network systems capabilities to participate in a Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) event scheduled to occur in October/November 2014 (referred to as NIE 15.1) at Ft. Bliss, TX and the adjacent White Sands Missile Range, NM (WSMR).  The purpose of this notice is to identify emerging capabilities to be evaluated against a set of entrance criteria for an opportunity to participate in a training event prior to the NIE. This Sources Sought seeks solutions with a narrow focus on Specific Identified Gaps in the current and evolving networked equipment solution set.  Functional requirements for these gaps are listed in Paragraph 2. These gaps are: <br>  <br> Gap 13:  Home Station Training and the Integrated Training Environment (technology)  <br>  <br> NOTE: The Army will be conducting a scheduled Network Baseline Assessment during the field events of NIE 15.1.  As a consequence the number and type of new solutions for this event will be restricted to prevent the introduction of non-baseline equipment into the brigade's networked systems. The Army anticipates the early release of a Sources Sought for NIE 15.2 and NIE 16.1 to allow industry additional time to prepare candidate solutions for those events.  <br>  <br> Due to the training nature of the single announced gap for NIE 15.1 not all the usual proposal submission requirements will need to be met.  <br>   <br> 1.2 The NIE is an Army hosted event conducted twice a year. The NIE is approximately two to four weeks long and employs a Brigade Combat Team (BCT) at Fort Bliss, TX.  The goal is to conduct parallel, systems tests of Army programs, evaluate new network technology capabilities, non-network capabilities and emerging in-theater capabilities and concepts. The NIE events will include tactical exercises using current force equipment and emerging networked systems.  <br>  <br> 1.3 This is a Sources Sought announcement. This does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. There is no basis for claims against the Government as a result of information submitted or demonstrations provided in response to this Sources Sought announcement. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement or otherwise pay for any information or demonstrations provided by respondents to this request. This notice is for market research purposes only and is not indicative of a full requirement.  Financial resources will not be provided for participation in the NIE. <br>  <br> 1.4 Sources must understand the entire financial burden of participating in this process to include: submitting a White Paper, briefing, and Training Plan; attending and providing an Oral Presentation at the System Under Evaluation (SUE) Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM); submitting solution candidates for a training event prior to the NIE participating in pre-NIE integration and planning activities and  training soldiers to operate the candidate solution at Fort Bliss, TX and White Sands Missile Range, NM and post-NIE de-installation and recovery activities  will be the sole financial responsibility of the source.  Field Support Representatives must be available to support each of these required events. <br>  <br> 1.5 The Government will provide a venue for an Oral presentation, assessment services and venue for the candidate solution laboratory testing, integration risk reduction venue, host platform and services and access to the NIE site and facilities.  The Government may provide integration support to integrate candidate solutions into military platforms and assist in network integration... <br>  <br> [REFER TO THE ATTACHMENT FOR CONTINUATION OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT.] <br>

<SUBJECT>Planned Sole Source Follow-on contract to provide auditing service of in-depth assessing of federal regulatory food testing labs
<SOLNBR>FSIS-04-B-14
<RESPDATE>013114
<CONTACT>Marnie Miller, Phone 3015044235, Email marnie.miller@fsis.usda.gov
<DESC>Sources Sought - Planned Sole Source Follow-on contract to provide auditing service of in-depth assessing of federal regulatory food testing labs to the ISO/IEC 17025 and ALACC requirements. The contractor shall identify non-conformances to the requirements found in ISO/IEC Standard 17025, ALACC and FSIS Laboratory Management System. The auditors shall have in depth training in ISO/IEC 17025, ALACC and federal food standards. The desk audit shall be performed and include a review of requested FSIS Laboratory Management System.
<p>Background - The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for the inspection of meat, poultry, and egg products to assure that they are safe, wholesome, unadulterated, and properly labeled to conduct analyses to determine the presence of pathogenic organisms, veterinary drug residues, environmental contaminants, microbial toxins and food ingredients.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a sole source, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. The period of performance will be for a 12 month base period plus four (4) additional 12 month option periods for acquiring the continuation of service in accordance to the statement of work (SOW).</p>
<p>As described in FAR 6.302 1(a)(2)(ii)(A), the services being planned are available only from the original source. This follow-on contract for this service will allow A2LA to continue supporting FSIS Field Service Laboratories to retain these specialized services to current operations and requirements for the project. The contractor onsite shall performed, but not be limited to, entry and exit briefings, review of quality documentation records, qualified in handling food samples, interviews of technical and management staff, examination of equipment and calibration records. The contractor will provide the laboratory a checklist containing their audit criteria to assist the labs in preparing for accreditation. The plan and auditor(s) must be acceptable to the FSIS laboratory management and must meet requirements for maintaining uninterrupted accreditation. The Government has determined that procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because procurement from any other source than A2LA would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and/or would potentially cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling of services.</p>
<p>Please submit your interest in response to this sources sought notice, and a description of your capabilities and past experiences to perform these requirements. This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. The Government does not intend to pay for information received. All interested parties must respond within fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice. Written responses must provide clear and concise documentation indicating your firm's capability to provide the required services. Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered. When responding to this announcement, respondents should refer to Announcement FSIS-04-B-14. If after January 31, 2014, no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement; USDA/FSIS shall negotiate solely with American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA).</p>

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 541611 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the size standard for such requirements is $7 Million per annum. Statements should also include an indication of current certified business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern's name and address) as well as the eligible business concern's name, point of contact, address, and DUNS number.<br /><br />Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB), a project within the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking capability statements from all eligible Small Businesses as stated above.<br /><br /><strong>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE. THIS IS STRICTLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The NCI is one of the world's largest public sponsors of clinical trials in cancer, supporting a broad range of prevention, diagnostic, imaging, and treatment studies of new drugs, procedures and multi-modality approaches for oncology patients. Developmental work for new treatments (Phase 1 and 2 trials) has traditionally been carried out in a limited number of institutions while definitive studies comparing new treatments to the standard of care (Phase 3 trials) have required multi-center collaborations. The NCI, through its Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) and other Divisions/Programs (e.g. Division of Cancer Prevention, Cancer Centers Program), supports multiple sites and investigators in North America to collaborate in multi-center trials/studies (e.g. NCI Cooperative Groups Clinical Trials Program for treatment and radiology imaging, Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORES), Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs), Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Programs (MB-CCOPs), Comprehensive/Clinical Cancer Centers Program, and CTEP Phase 1 and 2 Programs). These NCI multi-center programs each maintain the necessary infrastructure (e.g., scientific committees, statisticians, data managers and quality control monitors) needed to successfully perform clinical trials/studies.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) Initiative is a project of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to develop and implement a centralized model of IRB review for multi-site, NCI-sponsored clinical trials. The goal of the Initiative is two-fold:</p>
<p>A. To streamline regulatory compliance and decrease the duplicative burden of protocol review that currently occurs at hundreds of local IRBs nationwide by providing a single centralized review that can be utilized by local IRBs participating in NCI-sponsored multi-center trials.</p>
<p>B. To maintain and enhance the protection of research participants by providing consistent, expert IRB review at the national level.</p>
<p>Currently, the Initiative involves three CIRBs, the Adult CIRB - Late Phase Emphasis reviewing adult NCI-sponsored primarily Phase 3 treatment trials, the Adult CIRB - Early Phase Emphasis reviewing adult NCI-sponsored Phase 0, 1, 2 treatment trials and the PedCIRB reviewing NCI-sponsored pediatric Phase 0, 1, 2, 3, and pilot treatment trials. The CIRB uses an independent model of IRB review where a local institution and principal investigators inform the CIRB about local context considerations, including local laws and requirements, via the submission of annual worksheets. Each CIRB reviews the NCI-sponsored trials within their purview and additionally review the local context considerations for each institution with investigators credentialed to participate in those trials.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Organization must be able to complete the following tasks:</p>
<p>1) Initial Transition from current contract to new contract.</p>
<p>2) Manage and provide administrative and regulatory support for three Central Institutional Review Boards (one for adult phase 3 and large phase 2 trials, the second for early phase trials, and the third for pediatric trials of all phases);</p>
<p>3) Establish and support a fourth CIRB for review of DCP trials;</p>
<p>4) Manage and provide administrative and regulatory support for CIRB review of enrolled institution's local context considerations;</p>
<p>5) Support CTEP's requirement for institutions participating in NCI-sponsored trials to enroll in the CIRB Initiative and facilitate integration of these institutions into the CIRB Initiative;</p>
<p>6) Manage and support currently enrolled institutions;</p>
<p>7) Provide informatics systems to support all operations;</p>
<p>8) Communicate with NCI and stakeholders regarding all aspects of the Initiative</p>
<p>9) Implement and manage an Initiative-wide Quality Improvement Plan;</p>
<p>10) Maintain AAHRPP Accreditation per AAHRPP requirements;</p>
<p>11) Phase-Out Transition</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong></p>
<p>It is anticipated the services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures. It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement type contract will be awarded with a six (6) month base plus nine (9) six (6)&nbsp;month option periods beginning on or about June 1, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement/Information Sought:</strong></p>
<p>To be deemed capable of providing services that meet the CIRB requirements, please submit a written capability statement demonstrating the ability and experience in 1) planning and conducting CIRB meetings, 2) Understanding CIRB regulatory compliance, 3) Developing coordination and liaison with collaborating investigators or institutions as they complete requirements to open a study, 4) Maintaining and improving web design to support operations with information technology (IT) systems to increase efficiency and accuracy, and 5) Developing files and reports of work to allow efficient and easy transfer of data and knowledge. We encourage all responsible sources, particularly small businesses, to submit detailed concise information which will be considered by the agency.</p>
<p><strong>Submission Information:</strong></p>

<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).<br /><br />The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611 with a size standard of $14 million.<br />As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) through FedBizOpps. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.<br /><br />The objective of this procurement is to obtain support services to provide technical and financial management oversight for three NCI supported projects in Ukraine: follow-up for thyroid cancer and related activities in individuals exposed to radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident; field work for the case-control study of thyroid cancer in Chernobyl clean-up workers; and data collection for the case-control study of leukemia. <br /><br />The Chernobyl Research Unit (CRU), Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, sponsors joint U.S.-Ukraine studies of health effects of the Chernobyl Accident. Currently, there are two partnership agreements supporting three collaborative U.S.-Ukraine epidemiological projects in Ukraine. These projects are 1) "Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Diseases in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident" (P004) undertaken at the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism (IEM), Kiev; 2) "Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases Among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident" (P003) at the Research Center for Radiation Medicine (RCRM), Kiev; and 3) "Thyroid Cancer among Chernobyl Cleanup Workers in Ukraine" (P003A) undertaken as a variation of the project name, "Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases Among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident" (see below) also at RCRM. <br /><br />The partnership agreement for "Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Diseases in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident" (P004) involves thyroid screening and other related tasks in a cohort of about 13,000 people who were exposed to post-Chernobyl radioactive fallout under age 20 years. The aim of this project is to assess early and late morphologic and functional changes in the thyroid glands of persons exposed at young ages to radiation from radioactive materials released as a consequence of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident. The cohort members have been undergoing diagnostic thyroid examinations since 1998. Under a rigid protocol approved by NCI, IEM staff carries out the field work to maintain contact with the cohort members and invite them to diagnostic thyroid examinations, which may include palpation, ultrasound scanning, thyroid hormone and other laboratory tests. These examinations are done at IEM or by a mobile team. If deemed necessary by the protocol, cohort members are referred to an expert endocrinologist at IEM for a fine-needle aspiration biopsy for diagnostic confirmation. Interview information collected by IEM regarding residential, health, diet and lifestyle history has been used for estimating radiation doses by an international expert group involving NCI. Follow-up is also performed on all subjects for thyroid cancer morbidity and mortality through linkage with the national cancer registry in Ukraine. The IEM is responsible for the tracing of cohort subjects, recording medical and other data, data processing, and database management and organizing analytical data for NCI. IEM collects fresh and/or archived samples for study by NCI genetic and genomic investigations. IEM also provides data management and quality control, services needed for radiation dose reconstruction to be undertaken by NCI and other dosimetry experts, and assist data analysis and manuscript preparations for NCI.<br /><br />The partnership project agreement for "Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident" (P003) involves a case-control study of leukemia among clean-up workers carried out by RCRM staff. The objective of this study is to assess the risk of leukemia and other hematological cancers related to radiation exposure that the clean-up workers received during the recovery and clean-up operations after the accident. Data collection undertaken by RCRM is nearly completed, and major study results showing a significant risk of leukemia associated with radiation exposure have been published. The RCRM continues to provide additional data and/or biological samples for analyses performed by NCI.<br /><br />Recently, an amendment has been made to the above agreement with RCRM to add a case-control study of thyroid cancer in the same clean-up worker population, "Thyroid Cancer among Chernobyl Cleanup Workers in Ukraine" (P003A). Under the protocol approved by NCI, RCRM staff conducts field work to identify cases with thyroid cancer and non-cancer controls, interview them for radiation exposure information, and collect saliva samples for future genetic studies. In addition, under the protocol approved by NCI, RCRM acquire and store archival thyroid tumor tissues and other biological samples for NCI genetic research ("Tissue Archiving"). The RCRM also provides data management and quality control, services needed for radiation dose reconstruction to be undertaken by NCI and other dosimetry experts, and assist data analysis and manuscript preparations for NCI. <br /><br />In all three projects, NCI investigators are responsible for study design and methodologies while the contractor shall provide technical and financial management for the projects in Ukraine. <br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The Contractor shall perform the following:<br /><br />1. Work with Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism (IEM) and Research Center for Radiation Medicine (RCRM) to develop a draft agreement for each project (P003, P003A and P004) to become effective March 20, 2014 through September 19, 2014, if none of the Options are exercised, or March 19, 2016, if any of the Options are exercised, describing the scope of the project that includes the project objectives, work plan, personnel plan, budget lines, and reports and deliverables (technical and financial) to be submitted to NCI. <br />2.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />Department of Homeland Security (DHS),<br />Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Directorate
<p>Subject: Applications for Detection of Biological Materials</p>
<p>This exchange is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.201(e) as a Request for Information (RFI).</p>
<p>Please be aware of the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br />(b) Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br /><br />Additional Notice<br /><br />We reiterate that this is a DHS Request for Information and the use of any procurement terminology does not constitute a promise of any kind.<br />This RFI is for the DHS S&amp;T to gain knowledge of all qualified and interested sources with experience within the referenced subject and is being issued solely for DHS' informational and planning purposes as it may relate to acquisition strategy, planning schedules, feasibility of the requirement, development of the requirement, etc. This exchange in no way represents a formal solicitation for proposals, quotations, or bids with the intent to form binding agreements based upon results. DHS may (or may not), at the agency's sole discretion, issue a formal solicitation for this requirement at a later time. Within that vein, any descriptive /requirements information provided by DHS in this exchange is subject to change and shall in no way be treated as final or binding. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>Purpose of RFI</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Health Affairs (OHA), has reached out to DHS S&amp;T for assistance with technology foraging related to the use of canines for detection of biological threats. Despite countless past research efforts, there currently still does not exist an "electronic nose" that can rival a well-trained canine for detection of vapor signatures. The electronic sensoring community understands that the development of an "electronic nose", modeled after a canine olfactory system, would provide a leap-ahead sensing technology.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to collate into one document, as many sources of information as possible on the following topics:</p>
<p>(1) past and current research and development (R&amp;D) efforts or commercial off the shelf products in the area of "electronic noses"; <br />(2) past and current efforts focused on using canines as potential detection solutions; <br />(3) canine training services; and <br />(4) canine maintenance requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus of this RFI is on collating applications for detection and identification of biological materials. The collated information will become part of a comprehensive document which will be used by DHS S&amp;T program managers to ascertain the current state of "electronic noses" technology and canine detection (capabilities, training and maintenance requirements). Information may be used in the preparation of future research and development requirements for investment. <br /><br />DHS is committed to using cutting edge technologies and scientific talent in our quest to make America safer. Therefore, DHS S&amp;T has a mission to obtain technological resources and tools that are reliable and available to be utilized as well as leveraging the existing resources to help protect the homeland.</p>
<p>RFI Description</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As described in above section, DHS S&amp;T wishes to gather information regarding past and current research on the development of "electronic noses" as sensors for biological threat agents , as well as, the current and past use of canines for the detection of biological materials in particular (to include pathogens, biological warfare agents, organisms, toxins, and growth media). <br />DHS S&amp;T is interested in receiving any related information as well to include training aides and procedures, logistical requirements for purchasing, training, and maintaining the canines. If a source does not have specific information applicable to detection of biological materials but has information regarding use of canines for detection of other materials (chemical, explosive, narcotics) and feels that the information is transferable to the detection of biomaterials, that information would also be of interest.</p>
<p>RFI Response Instructions</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interested sources should submit a "white paper" of no more than five pages (12 point font, double spaced). Sources may submit a response in MS Powerpoint in no more than twenty slides. The response should outlining (1) your organizations research and development activities with respect to "electronic nose" technology (2) your organizations experience with the use of canines for detection of biological material (3) logistical requirements for the purchase, training, and maintenance of canines (4) information on how canines are used in as sensors (deployment CONOPs), and any pro's and con's in canine use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: The Government will accept responses from organizations with experience in either "electronic nose" technology or canine use. Response are not limited to those organizations with experience in both. <br />Sources should submit information by January 31, 2014, 5:00 PM EST to Mr. Aaryn Jefferson at Aaryn.Jefferson@hq.dhs.gov.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid DHS, please segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and will not be returned. Responses to this RFI may be evaluated by Government technical experts drawn from staff within DHS and other Federal agencies. The Government may use selected support contractor personnel to assist in the evaluation. These support contractors will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. This action will be governed under DHS law enforcement sensitive guidelines.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The 377th MSG/SC, Kirtland Air Force Base (Albuquerque) NM 87117 requires a bridge contract to succeed contract FA9401-05-D-0001 which expires on 15 September 2014. The bridge contract will consist of a one (1) year basic period of performance with a six (6) month option extension. The AFNWC/PZIB intends to make an award to Abacus Technology Corporation, 5454 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 1100, Chevy Chase MD 20815. Interested parties may e-mail brian.clark.6@us.af.mil, not later than 24 January 2014, 3:00 p.m. MST.
<p>All responsible parties may identify their interest and submit a capability statement which will be considered by the government. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Responsible parties must clearly demonstrate in the submitted documents that there will be no service interruptions and no added investment and start-up costs associated with award of a bridge contract to any contractor other than the incumbent contractor. Documentation submitted will not exceed five (5) pages and will be submitted electronically to the cognizant Contracting Officer listed in the first paragraph above. A determination by the government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Award to a new contractor for a bridge contract would impact KAFB's schedules due to the ramp-up time required by a new contractor to support a short period of C4 services. A bridge contract must be executed to ensure that mission critical C4 support remains in place to sustain Kirtland Air Force Base's mission and the various missions of its mission partners. Loss of contract C4 support would have a catastrophic impact on AFNWC and all Kirtland AFB organizations resulting in mission failure and potential negative impacts across the Air Force.</p>
<p>There is only one (1) contractor (Abacus Technology Corporation) who appears to be capable of performing these services on a short-term basis (i.e., bridge contract) with no service interruptions and without added investment and start-up costs.&emsp;</p>

<p>The Government expects to receive comments and suggestions which will assist in improving draft acquisition documents needed to affect this change. Specifically, suggestions that may improve pre-award planning, timelines, as well as any additional pertinent information industry deems necessary to improve the quality of the entire Request For Proposal (RFP) package.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>DMSP provides an enduring and survivable capability to collect and disseminate global visible and infrared cloud data to support worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) operations and high priority programs.</p>
<p>The DMSP mission was to be subsumed by the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). The NPOESS program, suffering delays and cost-overruns due to issues with sensor developments, was dissolved effective 29 Sep 2010. Ownership of the DMSP Command, Control, and Communications (C3) Ground System (GS), known as DC3GS, was transferred from NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) to the United States Air Force, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) in June 2010. SMC/WML (Colorado Springs) is the DC3GS Program Management Office (PMO). NOAA continues to operate the system on behalf of the Air Force.</p>
<p>The GS is an earth based command, telemetry and data processing system providing all functions for the state-of-health maintenance, communications, sensor payload data retrieval and dissemination, and launch and early orbit support for the DMSP constellation. The DMSP operation centers that command and control the DMSP constellation have not been technically refreshed in over twenty years. Major components of the system were reused from legacy control centers and in some cases are beyond their end of life expectancy. The ground system is operating under an Authority-to-Operate which is at risk due to system equipment being incapable of supporting current security postures.</p>
<p>Primary DMSP C2 satellite operations is conducted at NSOF's Space Operation Center, Suitland, MD and backup at the Environmental Satellite Operations Center (ESOC), operated by the, 6th Space Operations Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (AFB) CO. Five crews each of five personnel support satellite operations. Satellite contact is made through the Fairbanks Satellite Operations Facility, Fairbanks, AK; Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) ground stations worldwide; and McMurdo GS, Antarctic. Command and/or data recovery at the higher latitude, polar locations are particularly advantageous due to access nearly every orbit. Principle DMSP users are the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), Omaha, NE; and the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC), at Monterey, CA.</p>
<p><br />Statement of Need</p>
<p>The purpose of this effort is to sustain the DMSP C3 capability through the projected EOL. Particular interest is to reduce long term operations and maintenance costs through leveraging existing NOAA or NASA infrastructure; increasing automation; use of commercial satellite ground link antennas or services; and minimalizing use of AFSCN.</p>
<p>Trade space:<br />&bull; Use of AFSCN / NOAA / NASA / commercial antenna assets should be considered for commanding, up/downlinks, and data distribution<br />o Via cost effective and industry standard best practices<br />&bull; Use of automation to minimize operations costs<br />&bull; Change of operations concepts to reduce crew size <br />&bull; Investments, if any, needed to enable operational migration<br />&bull; Other relevant options the industry partner thinks is appropriate</p>
<p>Constraints:<br />&bull; Central user (AFWA / FNMOC) interfaces must be maIntained<br />&bull; Interfaces for space segment assets/equipment located at the NSOF must be maintained<br />o Primary Display System (Northrup Grumman)<br />o Advanced Flight Vehicle Simulation Facility (AFVSF) (Lockheed Martin)<br />&bull; Interfaces for the McMurdo Data Transfer Station (JPSS) must be maintained<br />&bull; DMSP SORD Reliability, Availability, Maintainability metric requirements must be met<br />&bull; Central user data delivery rate and latency requirements must be met</p>
<p>The following services are expected to be included in the RFI response:<br />&bull; Activities necessary to sustain the GS's ability to command and control DMSP assets<br />&bull; Components, if any, needed to be procured to enable an operational migration onto NOAA/NASA ground systems and their cost estimates.<br />&bull; Commercial services, if any, needed to be procured and their cost estimates<br />&bull; Activities necessary to receive, process, analyze, and disseminate telemetry and mission data to central users<br />&bull; Activities necessary to identify and resolve ground, space, and user segment anomalies / deficiencies<br />&bull; Activities necessary to obtain / maintain compliance with applicable US Government Information Assurance issuances or requirements<br />&bull; Life cycle costs estimates, to included projected O&amp;M savings, and methodology used</p>
<p>Access to Important Documents</p>
<p>All documents related to DMSP are considered to be sensitive but unclassified; therefore the Government has created a library which will contain all applicable procurement documents. Below are instructions on how to access the site:</p>
<p>Vendors need to fill out a nondisclosure form (please see attachment) and attach it in an email to Felicia.brown@us.af.mil requesting access to the site.</p>

<a href="mailto:donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division B</a>
<DESC>This is a Special Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) relating to Solicitation No. W15P7T-14-R-5002, which serves as a notice to industry concerning procurement of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) system for Army Aviation.  SALT is intended as a two-channel software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 radio, consisting of Link 16 and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW).  The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SALT requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products. <br>  <br> This announcement reflects the new solicitation number to be used for SALT, and it is an update to the Sources Sought notice under Solicitation Number W15P7T-13-R-5002, which was originally posted on 24 June 2013, and was subsequently changed on 1 July 2013, 9 July 2013, and 12 July 2013. <br>   <br> The anticipated date for release of the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is on or about 15 January 2014.  The anticipated date for release of the formal RFP will be approximately thirty (30) days after release of the draft RFP; however, this date may be subject to change.  A separate notice for the draft RFP, and subsequently for the formal RFP, will be posted with response dates and instructions as applicable to this solicitation. <br>   <br> Based on Industry response to the earlier notices, the Government has modified its previous intent to award a sole source contract for SALT, and will now pursue a full and open competition effort.  The Government intends to award a single contract comprising of a one-year base period plus four (4) one-year option periods for delivery of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) quantities of SALT systems, spares, and associated support. <br>   <br> For purposes of conducting source selection testing, the Offeror shall be required to provide at least three (3), but not to exceed five (5) production representative SALT units (e.g., radio, power amplifier(s) and components) at the same date and time when the Offeror proposal is due.  The production representative SALT units shall be configured to meet the requirements in the SALT Performance Requirements Document (PRD), plus any other equipment, operator training and documentation (e.g., up to two (2) days of operator training/equipment checkout at the Government SPAWAR Systems Center - Pacific labs; tamper, safety, and operation warnings; cables, cable drawings, Interface Control Documents (ICDs), remote controls) needed to interface to and facilitate the evaluation. <br>  <br> After contract award, a total of thirty (30) production representative SALT radios will be required for Government RDT&E activities (e.g., production qualification testing; reliability testing; waveform standards conformance testing and initial helicopter platform integration and SIL activities).  These thirty (30) RDT&E assets are to be delivered at a rate of at least five (5) SALT units per month, commencing sixty (60) days after contract award until all thirty (30) units are delivered.  A cumulative total of 22 units need to be delivered within the first 120 days after contract award.  Delivery requirements for the remaining balance of 8 units will be specified in the solicitation, but is expected to reflect a delivery rate of at least five (5) SALT units per month. <br>  <br> It is the Government's intent to award the contract on the basis of best value to the Government using a tradeoff evaluation process.  <br>  <br> Based on market research, the Government is not utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. <br>   <br> The above discussed intent is subject to change. <br>   <br> If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV. <br>   <br> This notice does not require a response from industry.  DO NOT submit any documentation / proposals / letters of any kind in response to this notice.  <br>  <br> All communications shall be submitted only in writing and should be submitted directly to the email address(es) identified below.  Contractors shall not contact any other government personnel other than the persons identified below.  Contacting any Government personnel other than the individuals identified below could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award. <br>   <br> No classified information shall be submitted in response to this notice. <br>  <br> The designated ACC-APG point of contact for this action is Ms. Rachel Bogner, 443-861-4658, rachel.p.bogner.civ@mail.mil.  <br>   <br> The alternate ACC-APG point of contact for this action is Mr.  Donald Morgan, 443-861-4628, donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil.   <br>  <br> No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD TO SINGLE SOURCE
<p><br />NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Seattle, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(i), with Amirix Systems/Vemco, of Bedford, Nova Scotia, Canada for the purchase of 472 each v4-1x-180k-0, Beta Fish Tags.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for acoustic fish tags that are compatible with National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) receiver arrays currently placed throughout the lower San Joaquin River and San Francisco Bay Delta.  Amirix Systems/Vemco is the sole source manufacturer of Vemco acoustic telemetry equipment, a combination of acoustic receivers for active and passive tracking, and miniature transmitters designed primarily for implantation in fish for scientists studying the migration and behavior of marine and freshwater animals.  Therefore, this procurement is limited to transmitters compatible with the current system only to ensure no interruptions to the ongoing data set.  Delivery date is no later than 14 April 2014.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide the 472 v4-1x-180k-0 acoustic fish tags that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this notice.  Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Task Order
Posted Date: January 17, 2014 Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Headquarters Procurement Operations Division (3803R) Response Date: February 4, 2014
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a one year sole source gap Task Order to Booz Allen Hamilton in support of the operation and maintenance for Regulations.gov, the Federal Docket Management System and FOIA-online.  
The purpose of this task order is to obtain IT infrastructure, web/application development, operations, maintenance, enhancement, project management, training, security and support services for this Federal system and the user communities.
The services are unique and would take time for a new awardee to acquire the necessary knowledge.  EPA plans on issuing a one-year, sole-source task order be awarded to the current vendor, Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc., so that during this time, the new process for choosing a long-term contract type will proceed.  An award to a source other than Booz Allen Hamilton at this time would result in an unacceptable break in service.  The incumbent contractor has the infrastructure, resources, expertise and security clearances in place to continue to provide support without the risk of an unacceptable break in service.  It is imperative to the EPA that the time is taken along with the other Federal user agencies involved, to develop a strong, long-term contract that ensures the needs of the government are met and that there is ultimately a fair, open competition for the long term contract.
This justification is in accordance with the ?Exception to Fair Opportunity? under FAR 16.505, and posting requirements of FAR 5.301 and FAR 6302-1. Only one awardee is capable of providing the services required, at the level of quality required, and in the timeframe required.  
Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. 
The point of contact for this requirement is Andrew Howe, Contracting Officer, at howe.andrew@epa.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a fixed-price purchase order on a single source basis to Money Media Inc. for subscription to BoardIQ. The contracting officer has determined that Money Media is the only source that can reasonably meet the SEC's requirement in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b). The subscription is required by the SEC for analysis and reporting on compliance and governance in the mutual fund industry. The publications&nbsp;of BoardIQ&nbsp;are under copyright, so it is not possible for another source to meet the requirement.
<p><br />The period of performance for the purchase order is anticipated to be one (1) Base Year and four (4) Option Years and the total value of the order shall be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</p>
<p><br />The SEC intends to award a purchase order to Money Media on or about January 27, 2014. This notice is not a competitive request for proposals. A competitive solicitation will not be issued. However, the government will give consideration to interested parties that identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals by the response date of this notice.</p>

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTE, OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. <br>  <br> This is a SPECIAL NOTICE. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million): Repair Brigade HQ Bldg 410, FY14, Ft. Hood, Killeen, TX.  This will be a solicitation for a Two-Phase Design-Build Construction contract for a single C- Type awarded contract. <br>  <br> Project Description: <br>  <br> This project shall include the design and construction for the renovation of a Brigade Headquarters building (Bldg 410), interior walls shall be constructed/reconfigured to meet the user group needs. Windows, doors, and curtain wall shall be removed and replaced with more energy efficient and blast resistant units. Exterior walls and roof shall be updated with better insulation and an air barrier, and the interior shall be completely renovated with new finishes throughout: <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br>  <br>  (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br> (2) Be consistent with law. <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA? <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to Robert.M.Duran@usace.army.mil no later than 31 January 2014. <br>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This a 100% small business set aside.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect though Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-33.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519 with a small business size standard of $25.5M.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to procure a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution that will improve the accessibility of SharePoint at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).</p>
<p>I. PROJECT TITLE</p>
<p>Accessibility Solution for SharePoint 2010</p>
<p>II. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Office of Information Technology, Division of Web Support and Collaboration Services supports SharePoint services for the Operating Division. Since HRSA's upgrade to SharePoint 2010, there has been a tremendous increase in user adoption and platform utilization. SharePoint 2010 now is used for internal collaboration, the HRSA intranet, business solutions that utilize workflow and some document and content management functions. However, SharePoint isn't completely accessible to persons with disabilities who use assistive technology and disabled users at HRSA have voiced complaints.</p>
<p>The production SharePoint 2010 platform used by HRSA is hosted by the National Institutes of Health, Center for Information Technology via a service level agreement. The HRSA SharePoint Team administers and manages the server farm remotely. The farm consists of two load balanced web front end (WFE) servers, one non-load balanced WFE, a dedicated third party tools server and an application server. Data is managed in a SQL cluster. The staging/testing environment is housed off-site at the Sterling Data Center and mirrors the production site. The work requested is not for new development.</p>
<p>III. PURPOSE/GENERAL DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to acquire a Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution that will improve the accessibility of SharePoint at HRSA. Currently, SharePoint 2010 is not fully accessible to all users. HRSA staff who depend on assistive technology (i.e. JAWS screen reader or Dragon Naturally Speaking voice recognition) are limited in their use of SharePoint. The solution should eliminate these limitations and allow users of assistive technology an equivalent experience without changing the look and feel or usability of SharePoint for non-disabled users.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS, CERTIFICATIONS, AND OTHER STATEMENTS OF OFFERORS OR QUOTERS</p>
<p>QUOTE INSTRUCTIONS: FORMAT AND CONTENTS</p>
<p>A. General Instructions</p>
<p>1. To facilitate quote evaluations, technical quote and price quote shall be submitted separately and clearly labeled. Each of these parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that the evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of the evaluation of the other. Volume I-Technical Quote must not contain references to price; however, resource information such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc., must be contained in the Technical Quote so that your understanding of the statement of objectives may be evaluated. It must disclose your approach in sufficient detail to provide a clear and concise presentation that includes the requirements of the quote instructions. Volume I must include a statement indicating whether any exceptions are taken to the terms and conditions of the request for quote (RFQ) as part of the quote transmittal letter. Any exceptions must include identification of the specific paragraphs and rationale for each exception. Exceptions shall also be noted in the quote at the location of the exception. The quote shall be submitted in two (2) volumes as outlined below:</p>
<p>Volume Title <br />I Technical Quote<br />II Price Quote</p>
<p>2. Quotes shall be single spaced and shall be printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper containing text no smaller than 12 pitch/10 point. Each page shall be numbered and each volume shall be tabbed to correspond to the table of contents. Offerors may include 11 x 17 inch foldouts only to display graphics, flow charts, organizational charts, or drawings.</p>
<p>3. Where data/information appears in one part, it does not have to be repeated in any other part. However, it shall be cross referenced by indicating the specific location including the volume and page number as a minimum. The clarity, relevance, and conciseness of the quote is important, not the length.</p>
<p>4. The quote must be signed by an official authorized to bind your organization. Please submit your technical quote and price quote via email to Kwasi Antwi at kantwi@hrsa.gov.</p>
<p>5. The RFQ does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a quote. In addition, the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this proposed acquisition.</p>
<p>B. Technical Proposal Instructions</p>
<p>This RFQ includes a requirement for Electronic &amp; Information Technology (EIT), and a corresponding HHS Section 508 Product Accessibility Template (PAT; referred to within HRSA as a Government Product Accessibility Template, or GPAT) that reflects the accessibility requirements for the type of EIT to be purchased. Quotes in response to this RFQ therefore MUST include the completed GPAT demonstrating how the quote meets the accessibility requirements contained therein.</p>
<p>The completed GPAT is a threshold requirement for technical review, and will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. A quote that does not include a completed GPAT, or includes a GPAT that is determined to be insufficient, will not pass, and will not be considered technically acceptable. Quotes that fail the GPAT review will not be submitted for technical review. <br />To facilitate the technical quote evaluation, the Offeror shall submit as part of the RFQ, a separate enclosure entitles, "Technical Quote." The data and information shall be keyed to each paragraph of the technical quote requirements as outlined below.</p>
<p>1. Complete the Government Product Accessibility Template (GPAT) (Pass/Fail)</p>
<p>Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed GPAT, VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.</p>
<p>2. Understanding of the Requirement (25 points)</p>
<p>The Offeror shall explain in its own words and in detail its understanding of the statement of work (SOW) requirements.</p>
<p>3. Technical Approach (70 points)</p>
<p>The Offeror shall provide a technical description of the proposed approach, methodology and tools to be used for each task area.</p>
<p>The technical quote shall fully describe how the offeror's solution will meet each of the requirements specified under the Statement of Work. This shall include all tasks and their respective subtasks including a discussion of any anticipated major problem areas together with potential approaches to their solution.</p>
<p>4.Past Performance (5 points)</p>
<p>The Offeror shall be responsible for requesting three (3) references to submit the Past Peformance Information Survey Questionnaire (see Attachment B) to the Contract Specialist no later than February 7, 2014, 2:00 pm EST at kantwi@hrsa.gov. Do not submit more than three (3) references. The Government reserves the right to obtain past performance information from any source.</p>
<p>The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated in conjunction with the technical review. The overall total score for the past performance rating for each Offeror will be determined by calculating the average of the surveys received. The overall total score will be rounded to the nearest whole number to assign an appropriate adjectival rating (0 = Unsatisfactory, 1 = Poor, 2 = Fair, 3 = Good, 4 = Excellent, 5 = Outstanding).</p>
<p>The elements being rated are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Quality of Product or Service</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory- Non-conformances is jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards containing similar requirements.</p>
<p>Poor - Overall compliance requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Fair - Overall compliance requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Good - There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.</p>
<p>Excellent - There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without commensurate additional costs to the Government.</p>
<p>Outstanding - The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated achievements and is commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".</p>
<p>b. Cost Control</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory - Ability to manage cost issues is jeopardizing performance of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, this level of ability to manage cost issues constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.</p>
<p>Poor - Ability to manage cost issues requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Fair - Ability to control cost issues requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Good - There are no, or very minimal, cost management issues and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.</p>
<p>Excellent - There are no cost management issues and the Contractor has exceeded the contract requirements, achieving cost savings to the Government.</p>
<p>Outstanding - The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where the contractor achieved cost savings and performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent."</p>
<p>c. Timeliness of Performance</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory-Delays are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.</p>
<p>Poor-Delays require significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Fair-Delays require minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Good-There are no, or minimal, delays that impact achievement of contract requirements.<br />Excellent-There are no delays and the contractor has exceeded the agreed upon time schedule.</p>
<p>Outstanding-The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent."</p>
<p>d. Business Relations</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory-Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is not effective. If not substantially mitigated or corrected it should constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards.</p>
<p>Poor - Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is marginally effective.</p>
<p>Fair-Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is somewhat effective.</p>
<p>Good-Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is consistently effective.<br />Excellent-Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues exceeds Government expectation.</p>
<p>Outstanding-The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent."</p>
<p>NOTE: In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available; the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. If such a circumstance exists, the maximum number of points the Offeror may receive for its technical proposal is 95 and the technical proposal will be evaluated on a scale of 0 to 95. If such a circumstance exists, all technical proposal scores will be converted to a percentage of the total points possible according to the applicable rating scale.</p>
<p>C. Price Quote Instructions</p>
<p>The Offeror shall submit a price quote, fully supported by cost and pricing data, in sufficient detail to allow for cost analysis that will be utilized to establish the reasonableness of the proposed costs.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING PROCURED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR PART 13.5. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Proposal (RFP). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-72. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519 for Information Technology Value Added Resellers, and the size standard is 150 employees. This is a total small business set-aside.
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Maisie Meade at maisie.meade@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>This solicitation addresses a need for a renewal of Check Point maintenance and support at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This procurement is for Check Point annual hardware/software maintenance and support. The NIST Network Security Team uses strategically placed Check Point firewalls to provide network security protection for both NIST campuses. All firewalls are centrally managed with Check Point firewall management appliances located at each site. This procurement is for an additional year of annual hardware/software maintenance and support.</p>
<p>NIST utilizes two forms of Check Point maintenance/ support. Premium maintenance/support is 24/7 support that is needed for firewalls NIST deploys within the network production infrastructure. Network Security Team staff often perform upgrades and configuration changes outside of business hours and on weekend in order to minimize the impact on NIST users and therefore, premium maintenance/support is needed. Standard maintenance/ support is provided within business hours. For firewall devices that are not critical to the network production infrastructure, standard support is used.</p>
<p>Additionally, NIST is using Check Point Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) blades on all Internet-facing firewalls. The IPS blades were purchased with the Check Point firewall appliances but the IPS updates for those blades are subscription-based which requires an annual subscription renewal.</p>
<p>Check Point manages customer devices, software licenses, and subscription blades within its Check Point User Center. Customers can have one or more account(s) within the user center to manage their devices. NIST has two User Center accounts that are renewed annually.</p>
<p>&bull; User Center #6598303 (Premium Support)<br />&bull; User Center #6492738 (Standard Support)</p>
<p>If hardware failure is experienced with any of the Check Point devices within either User Center, the vendor would process an "RMA" and send NIST replacement equipment. If a patch or new software is released by the vendor for any of the products covered within either User Center, NIST would be entitled to deploy that patch or new software. <br />The period of performance for Check Point maintenance for all Contract Line Items (CLINs) is March 1, 2014 through February 28, 2015. This is a Brand Name requirement and the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is attached.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because this is a renewal for items that were already purchased previously.</p>

<DESC>This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity  
in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design           
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified   
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The     
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical   
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or    
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate    
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's           
procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.
 The  
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering        
activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.        
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not     
been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.  Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have    
 been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally    
 such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you 
 are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the   
 information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS)  
 Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

 These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on  
 your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if     
 this is an item you have never made.                                            If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS 
 submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request 
 for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required  
 by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data    
 required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award      
 under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval      
 request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval        
 requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet      
 Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based   
 on Fleet support needs.  The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(A)<em> The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(B)<em> The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</em> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(ii) Examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>

The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.
(d) Suspension of payment. (1) The Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract-financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.
(2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension.
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to the designated office, and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor's financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract.
(j) EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause.
(1) The contract number (or other procurement identification number).
(2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s).
(3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this information.
(4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractor's financial agent.
(5) The Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox).
(6) If applicable, the Fedwire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the Contractor's financial agent.
(7) If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fedwire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ITEMS TO BE REQUIRED:
SCOPE OF WORK: 

Contractor shall provide readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans located in rural communities where the veterans reside (greater than 50 miles from the nearest Vet Center) within the following counties Teton, in the city/s of Jackson. These services are performed for the Readjustment Counseling Services, Vet Center located at 1030 N. Poplar St. Ste. B, Casper, WY 82609.               
The Contractor must provide readjustment counseling services to veterans who are assigned to their care. The term "readjustment counseling" means: individual counseling, employment counseling, bereavement, benefits counseling, and referral services for eligible veterans who have psychosocial problems as part of readjustment to civilian life after military duty during the specified conflicts. The Contractor must develop treatment plans for veterans in their care that document the progress to the veteran readjusting to society after serving in a combat zone.  The counseling may include traditional psychotherapeutic modalities, but the purpose of psychotherapy (or any modality) must be, as a primary task, to address readjustment difficulties derived from military duties and the homecoming experience.

1. BACKGROUND

Public law authorizes the Department of Veterans Affair (VA) to provide readjustment counseling to combat veterans and guarantees readjustment counseling as a lifetime entitlement to war zone veterans under Readjustment Counseling Services.

The Vet Center mission is to provide outreach and counseling to assist all combat veterans of any conflict to resolve war-related psychological difficulties and to help them achieve a successful post-war readjustment to civilian life. 

Legislation authorized VA to augment Vet Center services through contracts with private sector providers for provision of readjustment counseling to veterans who served during a period and in the theater of armed hostilities. 

2. POLICY AND AUTHORITY

In accordance with 38 U.S.C. 1712A, Department of Veteran Affairs, Readjustment Counseling Services (RCS) is authorized to furnish readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans  by contract with approved private sector providers, where the VA cannot provide such services.

3. ELIGIBILITY FOR CONTRACTED READJUSTMENT COUNSELING SERVICES

A.	Determination of full eligibility for services is when the veteran provides a certified copy of their DD-214 and is verified by the Team Leader/COR.

B.	Eligibility will be verified by the Team Leader/COR by reviewing the DD214 submitted by the Veteran, specifically noting combat service.

C.	Eligibility for readjustment counseling services is limited to war zone veterans who were discharged under honorable conditions. Individuals with other than honorable, but more than dishonorable discharge may also be eligible as determined by the VA (see 38 CFR, Section 3.12).

D.	In an emergency, if clinically determined that a crisis exists that requires immediate readjustment counseling services are necessary, the contractor shall immediately contact the Team Leader/COR to provide presumptive eligibility and authorization for services via phone. In such cases, the Team Leader/COR will inform the veteran that if eligibility is not substantiated, the veteran may be billed for the counseling services.

E.	Bereavement services for parents, spouse, children, and immediate family members of active duty Armed Forces personnel, to include Reservist and National Guard members, who have died in the line of duty and service to their country, are eligible for services    under this contract.

F.	Veterans possessing a Dishonorable Discharge are not eligible for services provided under this program.

G.	Sexual trauma/harassment regarding veterans of both sexes, all eras are not covered by this contract.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUBJECT WORK

A.	The Contractor shall furnish readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans referred by the Vet Center staff.

B.	Readjustment counseling, for purposes of this contract, is counseling provided by licensed mental health providers; clinical social workers, psychologist, psychiatrist, or other qualified counselors that will provide services specifically directed at social, psychological, or behavioral difficulties explicitly related to the post-war readjustment to civilian life. Such difficulties may interfere with a veteran's job performance, education pursuits, family and other interpersonal relations, or overall ability to cope with daily life.

C.	Modalities of readjustment counseling include individual, group and family counseling; all of which must have as their central purpose the post-war readjustment of war zone veterans. This service does not include general mental health services, but only provides readjustment counseling for psychosocial difficulties related to post-war readjustment from military duty, for example:

1.	Exposure to combat-related war trauma.
2.	Exposure to other aspects of war zone stress.
3.	Post-traumatic stress disorder (as defined by the current DSM) or other war-related social and psychological difficulties.
4.	Stressors unique to military duty for eligible veterans.
5.	Psychological concern over a possible service-connected condition.
6.	Substance abuse connected with military duty and/or post-war homecoming and readjustment.
7.	Difficult post-war experiences, including disrupted homecoming and unsuccessful re-entry into civilian roles.
8.	Concern over possible Agent Orange, biological or chemical agent exposure or ramifications thereof.
9.	Generalized alienation from society manifested by lack of expectable familial, educational or vocational activities.
10.	Psychosocial difficulties related to type of military discharge for other than a dishonorable discharge.

D.	The provision of medications and physical examinations are not to be considered a   component of readjustment counseling, and therefore, will not be provided under this contract as a reimbursable service to the contractor.

E.	Nonetheless, offerors should have the capability through referral to arrange for needed physical examinations, prescription medications or other medical treatment. When this is not feasible due to geographical distance, the contract provider should coordinate with the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) for assistance in facilitating referrals to VA medical providers.

3. GEORGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF ELIGIBLE SERVICE PROVIDERS

Contractor and Service providers submitting offers in response to this request for proposal (RFP) shall be physically located within the geographical boundaries for which the contract award is made. 

4.  PROCEDURE FOR SERVICE INITIATION

A.	Service initiation under this contract will be limited to referral only by Vet Center personnel, RCS Regional Managers (RMs) or designees. The number, type and frequency of readjustment counseling services provided to the veteran or significant others (i.e., members of the veteran's immediate family, legal guardian, or an individual with whom the veteran lives or certifies an intention to live with) will be a specifically authorized by referring Vet Center or RCS RMs or designees.

B.	If a veteran visits the contractor's office prior to contacting the Vet Center, the contractor shall provide the veteran the Vet Center contact information, so required interview, record, and official authorization is initiated and approved.

C.	Upon determination of eligibility and completion of psychosocial assessment, determining the need for readjustment counseling services, a referral will be made by completion of contract Services Authorization Form (VA Form 10-5565B). The original shall be maintained within the client's file maintained at the Vet Center. Copy 1 shall be mailed or given to the veteran or significant other, who will maintain and present it to the designated service provider, if the contractor has not received a copy of the authorization. Copy 2 shall be mailed to the designated contract service provider and maintained in the client's records within the contractor's records.

5.  REFERRALS FOR CONTRACT COUNSELING SERVICES

A.	Referrals to readjustment counseling contract providers are made by qualified Vet Center staff.

B.	Prior to making a referral to the contract provider, the veteran must be interviewed by the Vet Center Team Leader (TL)/COR or designee.

C.	Veterans Health Administration (VHA) qualified mental health professionals can make referrals to the Vet Center. All referrals made by VHA mental health professionals who are not Vet Center staff, will be facilitated by the Vet Center TL/COR, as the latter will assume responsibility for monitoring the case once the referral to the contract provider is made.

D.	Contract readjustment counseling includes the same mix of social and psychological services as provided at the Vet Centers, with the exception of community outreach, which the contractor is unauthorized and prohibited to perform. 

E.	The contract for fee program, as intended by Congress and implemented by VA, is for the provision of readjustment counseling and not for general mental health services. 

F.	Contract readjustment counseling may include social services and/or psychotherapy, but the services provided must address readjustment difficulties deriving from military duties and/or homecoming experiences. The provision of services for problems not having a clear and distinct relationship to military duty and readjustment to civilian life from military duty is not authorized.

G.	Specifically, the difficulties, which comprise war-related readjustment difficulties referable to a contract provider are the following:

1.	Psychosocial problems related to exposure to war trauma.
2.	Psychosocial problems related to other stressful experiences of military duty in a war-zone.
3.	Psychosocial problems related to post-war adjustment to civilian family and work roles.
4.	Psychosocial problems related to type of military discharge.
5.	Psychosocial problems related to substance abuse clinically associated with military duty or post-military readjustment.
6.	Psychosocial problems related to post-war homecoming experiences.
7.	Psychosocial concern over possible exposure to chemical and/or biological agents in the war-zone.
8.	Generalized alienation from society related to interruptions in the normal post-war readjustment process.

H.	Prior to making a referral, the veteran must be interviewed by the VA referrer.

1.	Although this may be either in person or by telephone, the referrer is responsible for ensuring that eligibility definitions and clinical assessment requirements are met. The clinical evidence should establish that the veteran's problems are clearly related to the military experience, be reflected in the reason for referral, and be documented in the veteran's record.

2.	Self-referrals and referrals of veterans who were or are in the private contract provider's caseload cannot be authorized, unless the assessment described above is carried out. In no event may VA be billed or required to pay for services delivered prior to authorization for care.

I.	After eligibility has been verified and the need for readjustment counseling clinically established, the Vet Center TL/COR will complete and sign VA Form 10-5565B, which officially effects a referral to the contract service provider. The completion and disposition of VA Form 10-5565B is to be implemented according to the instructions on the form.

7.	SPECIFIC TASKS 

Referrals and ongoing assessment of counseling cases will be managed, as to ensure the availability of services to the largest number of eligible veterans within the limits of available resources.

A.	The Contractor shall provide group and/or brief therapy whenever clinically feasible to facilitate serving the largest number of eligible veterans. Theater veterans exposed to war-zone stress will be considered the highest priority recipients for contract readjustment counseling.

B.	Group counseling will be encouraged whenever clinically feasible as this method is both clinically indicated and cost effective for Veterans with readjustment difficulties. The composition of such groups must include at least 50 percent eligible war-zone Veterans for a contact provider to be reimbursed for the group counseling session. Exceptions to this may be granted by the Vet Center TL/COR when clinically indicated.

C.	Contractor employees shall not be considered Government employees and shall not at any time identify themselves as such or perform community outreach in the name of or as the Vet Center or VA.

D.	In accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract, the Professional Services Letter IL -11-82-26, and the VA Form 10-5565B, contractors shall be required to perform as follows:

1.	All initial referrals to a contract provider will be for up to 3 visits for clinical assessment and brief counseling. The TL/COR will specify on VA Form 10-5565B, one, two, or three visits and the type of counseling to be provided (individual).

2.	The contractor shall schedule the initial veteran counseling session (visit) within 10 working days from the date the veteran was first referred under the contract.

3.	If additional visits are required upon completion of the 3 initial visits, the TL/COR will obtain from the contract provider a counseling plan documenting the need for continuing readjustment counseling. In addition, the TL/COR will ensure a verified DD-214 is provided by the veteran and inserted in the client's file.

a.	After reviewing the plan, the TL/COR may authorize the veteran for up to a block of 15 additional visits within a specified period. In similar fashion, subsequent re-authorizations are established (up to 15 visits) and updated case counseling plans are subject to evaluation prior to further authorization.

b.	In an emergency situation and/or veteran crisis, additional visits may be authorized over the phone by the TL/COR. The contract provider updated counseling plan may be presented to the COR orally, but must be documented in the veteran's file and followed with a written copy within forty-eight (48) hours.

c.	Effective management of case progress and available funding requires that the TL/COR specify on the VA Form 10-5565B a time period within which a block of authorized visits must be delivered. For example, a veteran does not use all 13 sessions during the specified time, he may be reviewed and re-authorized for additional visits at the beginning of the next quarter. A visit will last a minimum of 45 minutes for an Individual/Family session and a minimum of 90 minutes for Group sessions.

d.	The initial written counseling plan will be presented to the TL/COR no later than five working days from the completion of the third initial visit.  This plan shall be documented in the veteran's record by the TL/COR and contract provider. 

e.	The VA reserves the right to modify the treatment plan submitted by the Contractor. Coordination of the counseling plans to the VA referrer must occur in a timely manner, so there will be no disruption in the continuation of readjustment counseling. An updated treatment plan must be submitted and approved by the TL/COR before subsequent client visits are authorized for the upcoming quarter.

f.	While up to one visit per week is usually authorized, the TL/COR is under no obligation to authorize that frequency.

(1)	Frequency of visits of less than one time per week (e.g., once per two weeks, once per month) is clinically indicated in a substantial number of cases.  It is the responsibility of the TL/COR to ensure that such frequency is obtained when indicated.
(2)	Visits of twice per week may be permitted in exceptional cases when authorized by the COR on the basis of clinical assessment.

g.	Resource allocation per facility, overall needs of the total eligible veteran population in a particular locality, sound clinical practice, and the needs of an individual veteran will usually dictate a frequency of visits of one per week or less

4.	"Significant Others" defined as, members of the Veteran's immediate family, legal guardian, or individual with whom the Veteran lives of certifies an intention to live. May be seen conjointly with a Veteran in couple or family counseling by the contract service provider.

a.	This will be limited to counseling for problems, which have a distinct relationship to the Veteran's readjustment from military duty.

b.	For couple or family counseling, billing and reimbursement will be at the established per session rate as specified in the contract.

c.	Significant others may be seen without the Veteran present only when clinically required as an integral part of couple or family counseling. Such visits by significant others without the Veteran present, however, are limited to one visit per ten couple or family sessions that include the Veteran. Exceptions may be granted to the limitation on significant other visits only when clinically approved by the TL/COR.

5.	As stipulated in the contract, there is a provision, which limits eligibility for readjustment counseling through a contract provider to 1 year from the time of the veteran's first visit.

a.	This provision is based upon existing knowledge regarding the etiology and longitudinal course of war-related readjustment difficulties to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and upon program experience, which indicates that most veterans referred complete services within 1 year.

b.	This provision should not be implemented in an arbitrary manner nor should it be applied in isolation from other indicators for clinical case progress.

c.	In most cases authorization beyond 1 year should be short-term extensions designed to facilitate completing services or appropriate referral.

d.	Determination for extension of eligibility for contract services beyond 1 year, will be determined by a clinical report and plan submitted by the contractor, that will be reviewed by the TL/COR, and approved by the Regional Manager or designee.
 
e.	To determine and approve a veteran for an extension, the following procedures will be followed:

(1)	The contract provider will submit a request with a report and plan, with clinical significance of need for additional services beyond one year. This is not an authorization for service, but report of further readjustment counseling need.
 
(2)	The Vet Center TL/COR will review this report, determine if extension is clinically significant, and will interview the veteran (in person or by telephone) to conduct an updated, comprehensive psychosocial assessment to ensure continuing clinical need for readjustment counseling.

(3)	If there is clinical indication for continuing readjustment counseling beyond 1 year, the Vet Center TL/COR must consult with the RCS Regional Manager or designee prior to authorizing continuing visits. 

(4)	All requests for readjustment counseling beyond 1 year, for more than brief transitioning purposes, must be reviewed and approved by the RCS Regional Manager or designee and documented in the veteran's clinical record.

6.	If a veteran currently receiving services from a contract provider resides in a closer proximity to a newly selected contract provider or newly established Vet Center, the veteran may be transferred to the new contract provider or newly established Vet Center, in order to continue uninterrupted counseling from the most convenient service provider.

<DESC>The following questions have been posed regarding this solicitation:
<p>1. Q: When does the Government deem an item to be BER? <br />A: An Item is considered BER when the cost to repair/overhaul the item exceeds 75% of the Stock List Price (SLP).</p>
<p>2. Q: In some cases, contractors have been able to resuse containers the assets were shipped in. Will that be the case with this requirement?<br />A: The Government cannot determine what percentage (%) of &lsquo;unserviceable container' fallout a company may incur. For instance, if the operational field ships/returns a fuel pump in an unacceptable container the contractor will still be required and liable to provide the correct special packaging instructions (SPI) when producing a serviceable asset back to the Air Force.</p>
<p>3. Q: Addendum to 52.212-1, "Instructions to Offerors", Section 2.6, "Electronic Offers," requests encrypted emails be sent. What if the contractor is unable to send an encrypted email?<br />A: Contractors are welcome to fax their proposals to 405-739-3462, Attention Amanda Rossi Lockley with a cover sheet indicating "SOURCE SELECTION INFORMATION - SEE FAR 2.101 AND 3.104 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY." Contractors are also able to send unencrypted emails; however, please be aware that the Government will not be held liable for any potential leak of proprietary data if the email is hacked.</p>
<p>4. Q: Addendum to 52.212-1, "Instructions to Offerors", Section 2.8, "Distribution," suggests contractors provide DCMA and DCAA with their proposals. Is this mandatory?<br />A: No, the Government is only reminding those contractors who already have exisiting relationships with a DCMA ACO or DCAA rep to remember to submit their proposals to them as well.</p>

<p>The following clauses are incorporated into the solicitation in full text:</p>
<p>52.21-603-70 Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (June 2012)</p>
<p>____________________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) under this contract. (The designated BOP representative will be named upon award.)</p>
<p>(b) The COR is responsible, as applicable, for: receiving all deliverables, inspecting and accepting the supplies or services provide hereunder in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract; providing direction to the contractor which clarifies the contractor effort, fills in details or otherwise serves to accomplish the contractual Scope of Work; evaluating performance; and certifying all invoices/vouchers for acceptance of the supplies or services furnished for payment.</p>
<p>(c) The COR does not have the authority to alter the contractor's obligations under the contract, and/or modify any of the expressed terms, conditions, specifications, or cost of the agreement. If as a result of technical discussions it is desirable to alter/change contractual obligations or the Scope of Work, the Contracting Officer shall issue such changes.</p>
<p><br />52.24-403-70 NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)</p>
<p>Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal<br />Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification<br />Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.</p>
<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be<br />met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process<br />begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to<br />badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "<br />Employment Eligibility Verification, " and at least one document must be a valid State<br />or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is<br />responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be<br />completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must<br />be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level<br />associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI<br />requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum<br />Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:<br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />2) Favorable fingerprint results;<br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3<br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel<br />Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and<br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)4 portion of the applicable<br />BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.<br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.<br />If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be<br />issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau<br />of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results).<br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably<br />adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be<br />suspended or revoked.<br />2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems<br />and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing<br />requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for<br />short-term contractors are:<br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />b. Favorable fingerprint results;<br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and<br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the<br />duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.<br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will<br />expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term<br />contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term<br />appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.<br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this<br />contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a<br />second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for<br />the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract<br />for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and<br />must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.<br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.<br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees<br />needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a<br />maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent<br />access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each<br />week and is working on a one-year contract.<br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy.<br />Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer<br />policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.<br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT<br />system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background<br />investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.<br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be<br />issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or<br />space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not<br />exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one<br />year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.<br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated<br />provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI<br />meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.<br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition<br />notice 52.27-103-72 DOJ Contractor Residency Requirement (Jun 2004)</p>
<p>For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under a contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have:</p>

The contractor shall also notify the CO as soon as possible during regular business hours.<br />c. Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement:<br />The contractor further certifies that it has a security policy in place that contains procedures to promptly notify any individual whose personally identifiable information (as defined by OMB) was, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached. Any notification shall be coordinated with the Department, and shall not proceed until the Department has made a determination that notification would not impede a law enforcement investigation or jeopardize national security. The method and content of any notification by the contractor shall be coordinated with, and be subject to the approval, of the Department. The contractor assumes full responsibility for taking corrective action consistent with the Department's Data Breach Notification Procedures, which may include offering credit monitoring when appropriate.<br />d.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This is a Special Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) relating to Solicitation No. W15P7T-14-R-5002, which serves as a notice to industry concerning procurement of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) system for Army Aviation.  SALT is intended as a two-channel software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 radio, consisting of Link 16 and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW).  The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SALT requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products.  <br>    <br> For purposes of conducting source selection testing, the Offeror shall be required to provide at least three (3), but not to exceed five (5) production representative SALT units (e.g., radio, power amplifier(s) and components) at the same date and time when the Offeror proposal is due.  The production representative SALT units shall be configured to meet the requirements in the SALT Performance Requirements Document (PRD), plus any other equipment, operator training and documentation (e.g., up to two (2) days of operator training/equipment checkout at the Government SPAWAR Systems Center - Pacific labs; tamper, safety, and operation warnings; cables, cable drawings, Interface Control Documents (ICDs), remote controls) needed to interface to and facilitate the evaluation.  <br>    <br> After contract award, a total of thirty (30) production representative SALT radios will be required for Government RDT&E activities (e.g., production qualification testing; reliability testing; waveform standards conformance testing and initial helicopter platform integration and SIL activities), with hardware deliveries to commence no later than sixty (60) days after contract award.  <br>    <br> The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) is providing a draft of the solicitation for the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) for review and comment by industry. ACC-APG intends to host face-to-face meetings with industry sources in approximately two weeks from the date of this posting, and the details of the meetings will be posted by amendment to this notice. <br>  <br> ACC-APG is particularly interested in receiving comments and questions from industry as early as possible to facilitate consideration of items prior to issuance of a formal solicitation.  Industry sources are directed to review the Draft RFP for additional important information.  <br>  <br> The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SANR requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products.  The anticipated date for release of the formal RFP is approximately forty-five (45) days after release of the draft RFP, but this date may be subject to change.  A separate notice for the formal RFP will be posted with response dates and <br> instructions as applicable to this solicitation. <br>  <br> The Government's intent is to solicit and award, via full and open competition, a single Firm Fixed Price/Cost Plus Fixed Fee hybrid type contracts with a One- <br> Year base period and three (3) One-Year option periods for delivery of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) quantities of SALT systems, spares, and associated services. <br>  <br> It is the Government's intent to award a contract in a manner that results in the best value to Government using a trade off process. <br>  <br> Based on market research, the Government is not utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. <br>  <br> The above discussed intent is subject to change. <br>  <br> If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV. <br>  <br> Formal communications related to this acquisition shall be submitted by email to rachel.p.bogner.civ@mail.mil or donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil. No telephone requests will be accepted. <br>  <br> All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified above. Contractors shall not contact any other Government Personnel other than the person identified above. Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award. <br>  <br> All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked. Any documentation provided will not be returned. <br>  <br> No Classified information shall be submitted in response to this notice. <br>  <br> This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued. If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement. <br>  <br> Responses should be in MS Office 2007 or Adobe PDF formats. If a zip file will be used to transmit the information, please contact the Contracting Officer in advance to coordinate the process, as files with a .zip extension will be blocked from delivery via e-mail.  E-mail messages must be less than 10 MB in size.  If larger files are submitted, they must be broken into separate messages.   <br>    <br> No telephone requests will be accepted.

<BR> <BR>GSA Schedule Bids Only:  Sellers bidding on this opportunity MUST have the items requested on an existing GSA Schedule. The Schedule must either be in the Seller's name or the Seller must be able to document its ability to act as an agent of a partner's Schedule. Sellers must not bid more than their applicable contract ceiling price, excluding the FedBid Fee, for contract-specific items. If FedBid receives notice that, due to inclusion of the FedBid Fee, the Selected Bid's line item pricing is higher than the Selected Seller's applicable published government contract pricing, the FedBid Fee will be reduced to ensure the Selected Bid's line item pricing does not exceed the Selected Seller's applicable contract pricing. Sellers may offer Open Market items only in accordance with the approved Terms and Conditions of their respective GSA Schedule AND upon approval from the soliciting Contracting Officer. Information regarding GSA Schedules can be found at www.GSA.gov. <BR> <BR>This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified sellers may submit bids.The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2013-08-13 17:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com.FOB Destination shall be in the Statement of Work. <BR> <BR>The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention requires the following items, Purchase Description Determined by Line Item, to the following:  <BR><span class="label">Base </span> Period of Performance: 09/01/2013 - 06/17/2014 <BR><span class="label">LI 001: </span>Please See Attached RFQ and Evaluation Criteria for Details, 1, EA; <BR><span class="label">LI 002: </span>INTERESTED SELLER QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES:
1 - The base period starts on June 18, 2013, which has passed.  Can the customer provide an updated award date and base period?
ANSWER: Period of Performance is now to begin on September 1, 2013.
2 - Task 1.4 stipulates 24X7 coverage.  Does CDC expect live monitoring of worldwide media on a 24X7 basis by a live media monitor or will automated web crawling, website scraping suffice outside regular business hour. 
ANSWER: We are looking for real-time coverage not necessarily live coverage.  Real-time means getting stories shortly after going live on the news wires and/or shortly after publication.
3 - Does CDC expect worldwide (i.e., not just U.S. media) coverage?  
ANSWER: Primarily, U.S. media coverage, but we are also seeking global activities published in U.S. publication.  
4 - If so, do you expect coverage of English-language sources or English and foreign-language sources? 
ANSWER: English language sources
5 - The government requires resumes for key positions.  What does the government consider key positions? 
ANSWER: The media monitor is the key position. 
6 - This is solicited as an RFQ but reads as an RFP.  Can the customer confirm that in fact a full proposal is required, not just quotes.
ANSWER: A full proposal is required, the requirements of which are discussed in the attachments to the buy.
7 - The date for question submission is the same as bid submission.  We would require a sufficient amount of time to review the answers to our questions and adjust our proposal accordingly.  Would the CDC consider extending the bid submission delivery date in order to provide the required time for Q&A analysis?
ANSWER: The bid submission delivery date has been extended to August 13, 2013 at 5:00 PM EST to allow interested sellers time to formulate their proposals after the question and answer period ends. ALL QUESTIONS MUST STILL BE SUBMITTED BY AUGUST 6, 2013
8 - Will Attachment I - Resumes be counted against the 20 pages?  How about the cover page and TOC?
ANSWER: Resumes, the cover page, and the table of contents will not be counted against the 20 pages., 1, EA; <BR><span class="label">Option 1 </span> Period of Performance: 06/18/2014 - 06/17/2015 <BR><span class="label">LI 001: </span>Please See Attached RFQ and Evaluation Criteria for Details, 1, EA; <BR><span class="label">Option 2 </span> Period of Performance: 06/18/2015 - 06/17/2016 <BR><span class="label">LI 001: </span>Please See Attached RFQ and Evaluation Criteria for Details, 1, EA; <BR><span class="label">Option 3 </span> Period of Performance: 06/18/2016 - 06/17/2017 <BR><span class="label">LI 001: </span>Please See Attached RFQ and Evaluation Criteria for Details, 1, EA; <BR> <BR><a href="https://marketplace.fedbid.com/fbweb/fbobuyDetails.do?token=%3D%3DwBKxmaVGYR9yNAU9cGD5wXQAAAAAHeAAgAgTFCGg%2FFzzqQbJAAyVXBA0Or">Solicitation and Buy Attachments </a> <BR> <BR>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Buyer to respond.

GSA reserves the right to award multiple contracts in each major city.<br /><br /><strong>The solicitation for the MATOC will be restricted to small businesses.</strong>&nbsp; All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers. The acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15, Negotiated Procurement using the Best Value Trade-off Process. The government will consider past performance, technical factors and price as the basis for selecting awardees.

Subsequent (individual) task orders will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505 - Ordering, and in accordance with the task order terms and conditions including the designated Statement of Work.<br /><br />Individual task orders awarded against the MATOC will be competed among other IDIQ awardees and will vary in anticipated size ranging from a minimum of $2,000.00 to maximum of $2,729,000.00. The average size of projects is estimated to be $250,000.00.<br /><br />GSA intends to issue all documents to include the initial solicitation, amendments, clarifications letters and other applicable documents electronically.

Question:  The synopsis says that the  quote mark The Solicitation will be issued on or about 15 January 2014 quote mark  and that the  quote mark firms shall submit material as stated below (...) no later than (...) 6 January 2014 quote mark .  <br>    <br>  Answer:  The original pre-solicitation notice due date was originally on 06 January 2014.  The Italy Pre-Qualification due date is now extended to 30 January 2014 at 1500 hours Central European Time (CET).  <br>    <br>  2.  Question:  We had found out that the mandatory requirements is to have the SOA. We have noted that you do not specify an alternative for the companies of the remaining European Union Member States.  We just would like to verify that you are also taking into account the equivalent industrial classifications, by including the possibility of use the equivalent classification in each of the European Union Member States, in order to proof the technical competency.  <br>    <br>  Answer:  The Italy Pre-Qualifications are required to be submitted prior to the issuance of the solicitation.  These requirements are the country of Italy specific requirements.   There are no alternatives for the remaining European Union Member States.  Your firm must provide these Italy Pre-Qualifications in order to be considered.    <br>    <br>  3.  Question:  Reference solicitation W912GB-14-R-0010, Italy Job Order Contract. Qualification Requirements.  Our company, and we believe other companies, will require updating of the SOA certification to meet the requirements in the solicitation.  This process is normally a 60 to 90 day process which is made more difficult because the SOA offices will not process any documents during of Christmas and New Year holidays; from 15 December 2013 through 15 January 2014. It is impossible for any company to provide and updated and complete SOA by 6 January 2014.  Request USACE Contracting extend the Italy JOC Qualification deadline until 28 February 2014 so companies can accomplish the SOA certification requirements in the solicitation.  An alternative would be to release the solicitation without pre-qualification and have offerors provide their qualification documents in conjunction with their proposal due 28 February 2014.  This has been done in the past.  <br>    <br>  Answer:  The Italy Pre-Qualification due date is now extended to 30 January 2014 at 1500 hours Central European Time (CET).   <br>    <br>  4.  Question:  CH2M HILL question on Item 1: in case of Prime/sub binding teaming arrangement (not a JV) please clarify whether the Prime is required to have the OG1 prevailing Category or this Category could it be in the possession of one of the team sub(s).  <br>    <br>  Answer:  The prime is required to pre-qualify in the prevailing category  quote mark OG-1. quote mark  However, if the prime is not pre-qualified in all minor categories, the subcontractor is required to be qualified in the remainder of the minor categories in order to pre-qualify for the S.O.A. requirements. quote mark  The Offeror has to provide a teaming arrangement that shows how they will meet the S.O.A. requirements and letters of commitment for the proposed subcontractors.   <br>    <br>  5.  Question:  CH2M HILL question on Item above: Please clarify whether the  quote mark Mandato quote mark  is required to be submitted with the Proposal in response to the Solicitation (RFP) or not. It is our opinion that, since at the proposal stage there's no certainty of award, it is deemed not appropriate to bind irrevocably companies to JV for one (1) year, also because there are costs associated with the JV establishment and its maintenance that should be paid only after certainty of the contract award. There's also seem to be a contradiction in the clause, as the Government has the right to finally inspect and accept work and the work can only be completed at Task Order level under the Contract, so after the Contract has been awarded to the selected firm.  <br>    <br>  Answer:  Yes, as stated in the presolicitation,  quote mark It states that the Joint Venture Offerors shall, with their proposal (not now) furnish an Italian notarized legal document ( quote mark Mandao quote mark ) that establishes the Joint Venture. quote mark  This is not a negotiable answer.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 11, A nn Arbor, MI Medical Center 506-14-1-022-0539 Intuitive Surgical, Inc. This is the manufacturer and distributer of all supplies associated with the DaVinci Robotic System.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:
This is for disposable items that are required for use with the DaVinci Robotic System.  These items will be replaced at least monthly if not sooner depending on how many surgeries are scheduled and performed.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
Accessory Surgical Protective Tip Cover for Monopolar Curved Scissors $200.00/box of 10, Accessory Surgical Robot 4-Arm Kit $1300.00/box of 5. Total estimated cost of this order is
$6,000.00.  Please schedule deliver on or before 12-26-13.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:
( )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy
Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5; (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1)
Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the DaVinci Robotic System and it's disposable items. Due to the sensitivity of the procedures performed it is imperative that the replacement disposables are consistent with the initial order. This is a very specialized Robotic Surgical System that requires specialized accessories . Replacement disposables are required to be on hand in the event an emergency surgery arises and to ensure that enough supply is on hand in  case of contamination. At this time sufficient data and storage does not exist for proper par levels to
be established therefore waiting 14 to 30 days for delivery could result in jeopardizing patient safety.
 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:

At this time no other company offers replacement items for the DaVinci Robotic System.  If another supplier becomes available their pricing and product will be considered.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  \
The pricing has been deemed fair and reasonable in accordance with previous order history i.e. 506-
PO 506-A30445 awarded 8/23/2013 shows the same pricing for each item, $200 for item 1 and $1,300 for item 2.
14-1-022-0258.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:
Market research was not conducted at this time as there is only one source for the required items.
FSS and the internet were searched, only the OEM vendor for the DaVinci Robot system can provide these accessories.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: No

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  No

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:
No actions are currently available. Should another requisition of this nature reoccur, we would undertake a new market survey.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification  is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
