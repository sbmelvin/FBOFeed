<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Comscore Networks, Inc. for the renewal of professional services for the Web Evaluation Project.  The contractor shall provide NLM with: a) netScore Internet Audience Measurement Reports, with monthly data; and b) Custom Subdomain Reports, on specific drill-down domains within the NIH top level domain, with monthly data.  Comscore Networks, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide these services.  During the previous 2 years, NLM selected comScore Networks to continue to provide the Internet audience measurement service with custom subdomain drill-downs.  After further market research, NLM staff determined that comScore was the only vendor able to maintain continuity with the earlier netScore time series data, offer the necessary flexibility in meeting NLM's needs for custom analyses and drill down data, and provide by far the most complete coverage of the domestic (home, school, work) and international user segments based on the largest panel size and thus offering a basis for more comprehensive and accurate usage estimates.   Any other source would not be able to meet NLM’s needs. The period of performance is one year, September 1, 2003, through August 31, 2004, or as needed to assure continuity of service provided as a renewal of the current contract.  This service will be procured under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm’s ability to meet the government’s requirements.  Responses are required within 6 (six) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 03-217 shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Michael G. Kapsilis, Contract Specialist (301) 496 6546 kapsilm@mail.nlm.nih.gov or Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, (301) 496 6545.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for a follow-on effort for coaching and facilitation services in Reston, Virginia.  The USGS intends to award a non-competitive purchase order to Maura Beatty and Associates for new follow-on work. Maura Beatty and Associates assisted and guided the development and implementation of the Special Emphasis Program Advisory Committee (SEPAC), provided decision making tools to the new SEPAC Executive Board and developed strategic planning for the SEPAC.  USGS believes a non-competitive procurement to Maura Beatty is the most cost effective method because of the level of effort, time, and costs already invested.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. THIS ANNOUCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  No formal request for quote will be available.

<CONTACT>Alma Bergerson Contracting Officer 4062477801     abergerson@gp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The work involves excavation near the toe of the dams to replace toe-drain outlet structures.  Excavation will be to depths of approximately 20 feet at Fresno Dam and about 12-15 feet at Tiber Dam.  Dewatering and unwatering of the excavation areas at each dam will be required.  Each sump will contain two separate weirs and provide for measurements of individual toe-drain line discharge.  The toe-drains will contain a pump system and electrical supply housed in a prefabricated concrete building placed over the sump.  It is likely that saturated conditions will be encountered at Fresno Dam, requiring well points for dewatering the excavation.  The Tiber Dam River Outlet Works tailwater is very near the excavation site for the Tiber Dam toe-drain, requiring dewatering.  The location of Tiber Dam is approximately 10 miles south of Chester, Montana, in Liberty County.  The toe-drain location is approximately 700 feet south of the dam crest road.  The location of Fresno Dam is approximately 10 miles west of Havre, Montana, in Hill County.  The toe-drain location is approximately 600 feet southeast of the dam crest road.  The estimated price range for the work is between $100,000-$250,000. Solicitation packages are anticipated to be available on October 22, 2003.  Proposal are tentatively due on November 21, 2003, at the Bureau of Reclamation, Great Plains Regional Office, 316 North 26th Street, Room 2031, Billings, Montana 59101.  There is no charge for the first copy of the solicitation;  additional sets will be provided upon receipt of a non-refundable check or money order in the amount of $9.00 each.  After the issuance, the solicitation may be viewed, without charge, at the following offices of the Bureau of Reclamation:  Great Plains Regional Office, 316 North 26th Street, Room 2031, Billings, Montana and the Bureau of Reclamation, Montana Area Office, 2900 4th Avenue North, Billings, Montana.

<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available.  The Bureau of Reclamation Snake River Area intends to issue a sole source contract with HSQ Technology for a Master Station Upgrade and the addition of Boise Diversion Dam Node to the SIP SCADA system - (Southern Idaho Powerplants  - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition).  HSQ will provide two new main host computers configured identical to the existing system and assist in configuring one of the old computers to serve as local host to the Boise Diversion Powerplant.  They shall provide the correct peripheral equipment to ensure that the Boise Diversion system is compatible with the rest of the system.  HSQ will also provide technical assistance following the upgrade installation in the form of ongoing telephone support.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Data Acquisition and Control System Hardware.   1. Part# DC440 - 2 Channel, 100/300MHz, 400MS/s, 12 bit, 6U cPCl Digitizer Card with standard 64point acquisition memory/channel, ASBus, Control l/O.  (QTY 2)  2. Part# XB103 - ASBus connector for synchronization of clock and trigger, double terminated.   (QTY 2) 3.  Part#SP100 - AcqirisLive Software and drivers for Windows 95/98/NT4/XP/2000, Linux and VxWorks for Pentium processors.  Supported programming environments include:  C/C++, Visual Basic, LabWindowsCVl and LabView.   (QTY 1) Specification: Acqiris DC440 12-bit High Resolution Digitizer	      General:	The DC440 is a CompactPCI (6U) based 12-bit high resolution, high-speed data acquisition digitizer.  It has two independent input channels with fast sample rates up to 400Ms/s, broad bandwidth of 100 or 300MHz for extended frequency related acquisition and standard 64k-point memory for each channel. The combined high sample rate and wide bandwidth allow the high-resolution capture of signals, up to 100MHz through standard DC-coupled BNC inputs and up to 300 MHz via high-frequency AC-coupled SMA inputs (HF in).  For multi-digitizer operation, a high-bandwidth auto-synchronous bus system (ASBus) can be installed to enable low jitter, highly accurate triggering among channels for sensitive time correlation.   The system improves trigger flexibility by allowing any module input to be used as the trigger source for all the digitizers that are connected through the ASBus system.  The supplied Windows-based software allows easy control of the digitizer and is compatible with all Acqiris digitizers that are connected through the MXI-3 high speed PCI/PXI interface.  The interface supports data transfer rate between the host PC and the PXI crates of up to 100MB/s. Vertical Scale Information: Standard Input (BNC) Bandwidth (-3dB)		       DC to 100MHz Full Scale Range		     250mV, 500mV, 1V, 2V, 5V and 10V Impedance				   50Ù ± 0.5% @ DC Connector	    		       gold-plated BNC Offset				       ±1V for 250, 500mV and 1V FS 				   ±2V for 2V FS					±5V for 5V FS			    	    ±10V for 10V FS Channels				    2 Coupling			      DC into 50Ù BNC Maximum input voltage 	  ±10V DC (2W) or 10V RMS at 50Ù HF Input (SMA) Bandwidth (-3dB)    	      1 to 300MHz Full Scale Range		      _8 dBm (1.75 V FS) typical Impedance 			   50Ù, AC-coupled Connector				SMA, gold-plated Channels	    		    2 Coupling				    AC Maximum Input Voltage		     5V rms (AC component) at 50Ù Digital Conversion Resolution				   12-bit Acquisition Memory			     64kpoints (standard) per channel Sample Rate    100 S/s to 400 Ms/s simultaneously on both channels Time Base Clock Accuracy		    Better than ±2 ppm Sampling Jitter		    	&lt;1 ps RMS for 10ms record length Acquisition Mode		        Single Shot 				    Sequence 1 to 100 segments Dead time			      &lt; 1ìs Trigger (Internal and External) Internal Trigger Input Bandwidth				     DC to 100MHz (-3dB) Pre-trigger			 Adjustable to 100% of horizontal full scale Post-trigger				     Adjustable up to 100M points External Trigger Input Input		    		    BNC, gold-plated Impedance				    50Ù / 1MÙ Bandwidth				DC to 300MHz (-3dB) Maximum Input voltage		    ±5V DC Modes			    edge, positive and negative System Performance DC Accuracy			          &lt; ±0.5% of FS (standard input) SNR				      &gt; 62dB (standard input)					  &gt; 65 dB with BWL @35MHz					&gt; 65 dB (HF in) THD (&lt;25MHz signal)		     &lt; -73dB (standard input)	    			 &lt; -75dB (HF in) SFDR (&lt;25Mhz signal)	         &gt; 75 dB (standard input)			     &gt; 80 dB (HF in) ASBus for Digitizer Synchronization A special connector uses for integrating two or more digitizers (same model) for high-speed, time sensitive trigger applications. Software Windows-based software, drivers, and library for data control and acquisition are supplied free of charge to develop user applications. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Acqiris USA, P.O. Box 2203, 234 Cromwell Hill Road, More, NY. Pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonable available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:	  NASA/MSFC has a complete data acquisition and control system hardware from Acqiris.  The new digitizers must be able to integrated into the existing Acquiris system, hardware bus, timing and control electronics, and the same software as our current system. To insure compatibility between the new digitizers and our existing system, is to use digitizers built by the same manufacturer that built the original system. The Acquiris Data acquisition and control hardware is critical to the assembly and testing schedule of the Propulsion experiment. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 8, 2003. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

CONTRACT WORK REQUIREMENTS/SPECIFICATIONS


I.  SCOPE OF WORK

1.1 Furnish all supervision, labor, material, and equipment needed to complete the work listed below to replace existing CCTV System [cameras throughout] and replace control center equipment, to include but not limited to, cameras, monitors, controllers and recorders.

NOTE: The existing console will not be replaced.  

1.2. Existing wiring will be used to the greatest extent possible.  Work includes all patching and painting to match existing construction of any areas damaged or altered as a result of this project.  Work is to take place throughout desinated buildings. All components shall be fully functional at the completion of the job. Based on performance, cost, features, and to achieve compatibility/uniformity Panasonic equipment has been specified. 

1.3. Equipment that is replaced as specified herein shall become the property of the contractor; therefore, the final cost for this project must reflect and include any reasonable salvage and/or recycle credit due the Government.

II.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

2.1 All GSA security requirements must be met before any work is started.  All onsite personnel will be required to provide fingerprints, State Bureau of Investigation report, and a completed GSA personal history background form.

2.2 The Contractor must check in with FPS to get their Contractors Badges for identification.

2.3 The Contractor must check in each day with building security to let them know where they will be working for the day.

2.4 The Contractor shall notify Building Security when it is necessary to use the loading dock. If a large load is expected, notify Security ahead of time.

2.5 Permission must be obtained from tenants before working in their areas. 

III.  WORK HAZARDS and SPECIAL JOB REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Since the majority of the work is limited to direct replacement using the existing wire, cable and mounting hardware to the greatest extent possible, the following is not a major concern, however, the contractor must be aware that the building was constructed in the 1940’s and it contains asbestos.  If a material is encountered that is considered suspect, all work at that location is to cease until a determination is made on the material.  If the asbestos is in good shape and will not be disturbed, it should not present a problem. The contractor will not be responsible for any ceiling HEPA vacuuming and cleanup necessary to accomplish the work. The Contractor is responsible for any contamination and cleanup that results from the contractor encountering a suspect material and continuing to work.

a. An asbestos survey was performed on the building and identified areas that contain asbestos.  This survey may not have identified all the asbestos in the building.  Known asbestos containing materials are some floor tiles and mastic, insulation hard fittings/joints on the piping, pedestal adhesive, transite wallboard, some ceiling tiles and HVAC mastic. The building fire doors are suspected to contain asbestos along with some piping expansion joints.

NOTE 1: Most of the asbestos containing materials have been abated so, due to the limited scope of work for this project, any remaining amount of asbestos containing materials should not be disturbed during equipment replacement as specified herein, however, all contractors need to be aware of the situation and take appropriate precautions as referenced in this specification and according to all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The contractor must have at least one competent person that reviews the work areas and manages the project. If the competent person encounters and/or is notified of any unforeseen suspect material then work shall immediately stop until an evaluation can be made. The competent person is responsible to ensure that existing asbestos containing materials [if any and at this point it is very unlikely] are not disturbed. The competent person should have, at minimum, attended at least a two-hour awareness class on asbestos. 

NOTE 2: The referenced training above is the industry standard for asbestos awareness; however, not having the training does not release the competent person from the responsibility to ensure that asbestos is not disturbed while performing this project.

(BUILDING ASBESTOS SURVEY available from FPS or the Buildings Manager.)

b. Cost of additional testing will not be the contractors’ responsibility. Additional testing will only be necessary if an unforeseen material is uncovered and for this project the odds are that are none to very minimal. 

c. All contractor employees and subs that will be working on the job must, at minimum, be briefed on what materials are asbestos free so they will know when to have a concern to stop work. Again, for this project we are replacing equipment in areas that have already been cleared, however, all parties working on the job must at least have the awareness to recognize a potential hazard and an unforeseen site condition. 

3.2 Cable to be run in existing penetrations where possible.  Fire stop material must be replaced at the end of each day.  Only when applicable; fire stop all new penetrations. Fire stop the existing penetration/s that are no longer used.

3.3 All work must meet all applicable Fire and Building Codes

3.4 All material used must meet building standards.

3.5 Unless otherwise approved, interior work in occupied space will be done after hours to minimize interruptions for the tenant agencies.  

IV. SPECIFIC WORK REQUIREMENTS/SPECIFICATIONS

<DESC>The contractor shall provide all necessary labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, and materials to support the commercial flooring requirements, exclusive of residential flooring, for Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho facilities.  The materials and services to be provided by the contractor shall be of the best available quality as outlined in the solicitation and statement of work.  Materials and labor to be provided include, but are not limited to, carpet, tile, sheet vinyl, cove base, wood base, installation and removal of listed materials, floor repair, and trimming of provided doors.  This solicitation shall result in a firm-fixed priced requirements type contract that shall consist of a base year and four one-year options.  The government anticipates recurring requirements but cannot predetermine the precise quantities that designated government activities will need during a definite period.  The government intends to fill all actual purchase requirements for supplies and/or services by placing orders with the contractor within the scope of the contract.  Because the government may encounter unforeseen conditions under old flooring, additional supplies and/or services may be added to the contract.  Such additions shall be added by bilateral modifications.  If potential contractors submitted proposals for solicitation F10603-03-R-0003 which was cancelled, new and complete proposals must be submitted for this solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 442210.  The government intends to set-aside this requirement for small business and is waiting for a ruling from the Small Business Association.  A modification to this synopsis shall be posted at a later date stating the set-aside status.  Solicitation documents will be made available on or about 15 September 2003.

<SUBJECT>A -- ADVANCED ANTENNA TECHNOLOGY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<SOLNBR>F19628-03-R-0047
<RESPDATE>042503
<CONTACT>Mr. Bill Donaldson, Contracting Officer, 781-271-6091
<DESC>Advanced Antenna Technology Request for Information This is a request for information (RFI) and not a solicitation. INTRODUCTION: The Government is requesting information from companies working on multiple beam antenna designs suitable for high data rate airborne satellite and Line of Sight communication applications.  The Government is interested in receiving information from antenna systems vendors as well as key component vendors whose technology is useful in the development of multiple beam antennas.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to be used in determining development requirements of an airborne wideband antenna. SCOPE: The AF is seeking a scaleable, low profile airborne wideband antenna solution suitable for high data rate airborne satellite and Line of Sight communication applications.  It is desirable that this wideband antenna system be capable of operating simultaneously in EHF and either commercial or military Ka and/or Ku frequency bands.  Key issues of interest include antenna producibility, scaleability, and cost. The AF user community has overwhelmingly stated the need for simultaneous high data rate connectivity to multiple satellites or LOS receivers. However, companies should understand that although operational needs exist, firm technical requirements for an advanced airborne wideband antenna have not been defined.  Technical requirements will evolve and will be influenced by the availability, maturity and cost of technology; "cost as an independent variable" and "cost of ownership" are significant drivers.  The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to gain an understanding of potential approaches to development of an airborne wideband antenna system.  The Government seeks to understand the current state of the art in higher frequency array design for communications, as well as future planned development or needed developments and how they might apply to a scaleable airborne wideband antenna system. The Government seeks to solicit the interest of vendors, organizations and/or consortia with EHF/ Ku/ Ka band expertise in one or more of the following areas: 1.	Multiple, simultaneous, independently steerable beam antennas for EHF, Ka and possibly Ku bands of operation.  The envisioned antenna system includes transmit and receive capability, with an emphasis on scaleable architectures. 2.	Enabling antenna technology and/ or fabrication (i.e., HDI, multilayered manufacturing processes, etc.) 3.	Thermal analysis and thermal management strategies of antenna structures 4.	Application of digital signal processing techniques to beam formation 5.	Antenna component technology, such as phase shifters, amplifiers, true time delay, etc. OBJECTIVE SYSTEM: Low profile (approximate 3 to 5 inch height) scalable (modular), multi-beam, multi-band antenna to achieve an EIRP of 55-60 dBw (EHF) and a G/T of 8-11 dB/K (EHF) within an approximate 3 to 4 sq. ft. footprint DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: To achieve the Objective System the Government requests that interested companies provide an information package.  The technical areas of interest/ concern are listed below.  Use it as a guideline to formulate your reply, addressing areas that are pertinent to your technology: 1.	Statement of interest, either as a Prime- or a Sub-contractor/ partner/ team member. 2.	Description of qualification: Projects Products Applicable experience including development and integration of similar airborne qualified antennas 3.	Definition of existing architecture, architecture integration challenges, and related critical manufacturing processes. 4.	Definition of antenna size, number of simultaneous beams, and the associated impact on the architecture and manufacturing approach, element spacing and scan range, lattice, LNA noise figure, phase shifter # of bits and losses, power amplifier design, power added efficiency, and output power. 5.	Recommendations on how to make the design suitable for operation on Navy, as well as Air Force, platforms (shipboard and airborne) in order to increase the production volume. 6.	Identification of how the antenna can be adapted to a scaleable architecture.  (Discuss a minimum replaceable unit concept versus alternative approaches.  In addition, discuss whether the antenna architecture lends itself to component upgrades over time.) 7.	Identification of process and component cost drivers and methodologies for lowering costs. 8.	Identification of key technologies that are not mature or advancements that can be leveraged to improve the technology. 9.	Description of thermal management design/ strategy. 10.	Identification of multiple beam control technology and maturity, beam update rate, beam pointing accuracy, sidelobe control, and pattern coverage when the antenna system is located on the platform.  (Highlight performance concerns in these areas.) 11.	Description of antenna installation and impact on various airborne platforms. 12.	Discussion of the use of a digital interface, and the possible implementation of signal processing techniques for beam adaptation. 13.	Description of antenna axial ratio performance and scan losses as a function of scan angle. POINT OF CONTACT: Responses to this RFI are due to Mr. Bill Donaldson by 3:00 PM EST on 25 April 2003. If Classified Information is to be included in response to this request, please notify Mr. Donaldson at least three days prior to submission.

<SUBJECT>29 -- Repair and/or Refurbishment of Engine Bearings
<SOLNBR>F34601-03-R-0508
<RESPDATE>101403
<ARCHDATE>10282003
<CONTACT>Susan Cockrell, Contract Specialist, Phone 405 734-8110, Fax 405 739-4237, Email susan.cockrell@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>Reference Previous Announcements:  Qualifications Requirements Posted 13 Jun 03, Reference Number 3110-03-3.  Pre-Synopsis, Posted 23 May 03, Reference Number 3110-03-2. Repair and/or refurbishment of engine bearings for use in the J69 engine (T-37 aircraft) and the J85 engine (T-39, A-37, F-5 aircraft).  The approximate response date is 14 Oct 2003.  The contractor shall provide all labor, facilities, equipment and all material to accomplish repair and/or refurbishment, packing, preservation and packaging. No Government Furnished Material, (GFM); only Contract Furnished Material  (CFM).  No Government Tooling provided. A Requirements Type, FFP contract, with a one year basic and four one-year options for all items.  Estimated Total Dollar is approximately $2 Million for the life of the contract.  Qualifications Requirements:  Sources must be qualified prior to being considered for award, in accordance with FAR 52.209-1.  Award will be made only if the offeror or the manufacturer meets qualifications requirements at the time of award.  Qualification Requirements were previously posted on FED BIZ OPS (see reference above). Solicitation will contain instructions for obtaining further information on this requirement. No Telephone Requests.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requester is acceptable.  All responsible sources solicited may submit a bid, proposal, or quote which if timely shall be considered.  
CRITICALITY: Many of these bearings are life-limited main engine bearings, which support the core turbo-machinery, i.e. the compressor and turbine rotors.  Non-conformances in the services provided by this contract are likely to cause extensive secondary damage and can cause loss of the weapon system and loss of life.  
COMPLEXITY:  The refurbishment services provided under this contract involve cleaning, inspection, disassembly, and reassembly of bearings, as well as honing, buffing/polishing of races and the replacement of separators (cages), rings and rolling elements.  The processes required are:  honing, noise detection, magnetic particle inspections, fluorescent penetrate inspection, demagnetization, buffing/polishing, plating and corrosion control cleaning/preservation.  These services require “clean” rooms, special equipment and a calibration facility.   These services are complex and require special quality controls.
RISK:  Because of the criticality and complexity described above, the risk to safety-of-flight and weapon system reliability may require pre-award qualification of all potential refurbishment sources.
NOTE:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.   The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selections process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.

The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items applies.  Addendum to FAR 52.212-1, Paragraph (b)(5): Offers shall provide an express warranty which at a minimum shall be the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public.  Express warranties shall be included in the contract. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items applies as well as the following addendum clauses: FAR 219-1, Small Business Program Representations; FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside; FAR 52.211-5, Material Requirements. The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Comm ercial Items applies with the following applicable clauses for paragraph (b): FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; FAR 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era. DFARS 252.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items, applies with the following clauses applicable for paragraph (b): DFARS 252.225-7001, Buy American Act and Balance of Payment Program; and DFARS 252.225-7012, Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities; and FAR 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal. OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Repres entation and Certifications – Commercial Items. The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. 52.212-2  EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS--OCT 1995 (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.   (I)    TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE  REQUIREMENT (ii)   PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)  PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or  unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is approximately equal  to Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.    (b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either comme rcial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.  (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefo re, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available  for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic req uirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications – Commercial Items. The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. 52.212-2  EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS--OCT 1995 (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.   (I)    TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE  REQUIREMENT (ii)   PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)  PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will  be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is approximately equal  to Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.    (b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine wh ether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.  (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.   Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation  of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or ot herwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-01-R-0023 was publicized in the CBD on 01 March 2001 by the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (formerly STRICOM).  This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research effort entitled, “Special Reconnaissance Simulator Research & Development Project.”  Technical Points of Contact:  RDECOM-STC, Mr. James Grosse, (407) 384-3872; email: james.grosse@us.army.mil or Mr. Mark Stoklosa, (407) 384-3928; email: Mark.J.Stoklosa@us.army.mil (email contact preferred).  Contractual Points of Contact:  NAVAIR-Orlando-TSD, Ms. Dorothy Bryant, Contract Specialist, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL  32826 or Ms. Vanessa Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL  32826.  OBJECTIVE:  Provide a prototype that can immerse up to 3 Soldiers in a single virtual reality simulator for Special Operating Forces training in active reconnaissance in the search of high value targets and critical priority intelligence requirements to include WMD equipment and facilities. The system is desired to have as wide a field of view as possible; minimum desired is 270 degrees in vertical and horizontal with 360 degrees being the goal.  The immersed Soldiers must be able to observe specific terrain areas, identify targets, use devices like binoculars, scopes, & Night Vision Goggles, perform day and night operations, and eventually maneuver in the system and engage reactive targets as required.

The working prototype will also have internal devices that replicate PRC-137F HF and DAMA satellite terminals operating in duplex mode.  Message traffic will flow to and from the tender’s station and the transceiver mock-ups within the simulator. 

It is desired to be able to generate geo-specific databases that can be visualized in the immersive environment and used for OneSAF.  Database must be generated within 24 hours of receiving NIMA and other imagery data.  3 initial databases with variable scenarios will be developed to demonstrate the technology (Prisoner of War camp, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and Command and Control Nodes).

The immersive system must be capable of ingesting the 3D visualization databases, networking with OneSAF Testbed Baseline (OTB) to generate the targets, and displaying high resolution targetry.  System must be capable of displaying numerous types of OTB entities simultaneously to include individuals, moving and static vehicles and aircrafts, and weapons fire.

A phased approach to this prototype is sought.

PHASE I. The phase I effort will consist of a prototype to allow a three man team to perform stationary reconnaissance training mission. At least one database must be developed during this phase. Concepts and implementation of the processes to develop these databases will be worked during this phase. The prototype must perform, at a minimum, day operations and as a goal night operations. The system will allow the soldiers to observe specific terrain areas and clearly identify targets with specific markings through the use of devices like binoculars, scopes, & Night Vision Goggles.  A minimum field of view for this system will be greater than 180 degrees in the horizontal and 135 degrees in the vertical.  Some high fidelity targets will be available for viewing in the system.  A demonstration will be conducted at the US Army’s Simulation Technology Center in Orlando, FL or at Ft Bragg, NC.

Phase 1 will be a 1 year effort and funding may consist of approximately $500,000.

Future Phases: Development will continue of the requirements described in Phase I to achieve the desired results.  Follow-on phases will incorporate the technologies developed in preceding phases.  Each future phase will consist of 1 year of effort and approximately $500,000. The end product will consist of a prototype simulator installed at Ft Bragg, NC and or MacDill AFB, FL for demonstrations and evaluations.

PHASE II.  The prototype will add the functionality of allowing the immersed Soldiers to engage targets and be engaged by target. A sniper rifle and M4 rifle will be available to engage the targets. Day and night operations are required for this phase. The ability to laze targets is required. A second database will be developed and the tools for creating future databases within 24 hours will be completed. The field of view of the system will be increased to 270 degrees in the horizontal and 180 degrees in the vertical.  Additional high fidelity targets will be added.  A demonstration will be conducted at the US Army’s Simulation Technology Center in Orlando, FL or at Ft Bragg, NC.

PHASE III. The ability for the Soldier to maneuver through the environment will be added. The database will now be dynamic and not stationary.  All night and zoom devices will be available in the system to identify and engage targets.  Additional weapons may be added to the system. The third database will be developed using the processes developed in Phase II. The field of view will be increased to 270 degrees in the horizontal. Additional high fidelity targets may be added to the system.  The prototype system will be installed and demonstrated at Ft Bragg, NC and or MacDill AFB, FL.

There will be at least 2 mandatory formal technical interchange meetings during Phase 1.  
This announcement constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal request-for-proposal or other solicitation regarding this Notice be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA intends to procure on an unrestricted basis Reflective 3D Seismic Data Acquisition.  The contractor shall provide a turnkey* to acquire a total of approximately 20 square miles (10 sq mi at each site) of subsurface reflection seismic profile data in west-central NV.    The two locations are Hawthorn Army Ammunition Depot, Hawthorn (HWAD), NV and the Naval Air Station Fallon (NASF), NV.    Background: The Geothermal Program Office (GPO) is seeking to define the subsurface structural setting in both locations in order to facilitate selection of drill holes for geothermal development.  Both sites are sediment filled valleys located in the western Basin and Range, and they have been subject to intense strike-slip and oblique-slip faulting.  Faults are generally near vertical (60-80 degree dip) and are believed to be oriented as shown in enclosure available (see POC below).    Target depths are in the range of five to seven thousand feet, although they may be shallower in the eastern side of the NASF survey and on the western side of the HAWD.  These areas of interest include primarily military lands, with some adjacent public lands under the jurisdiction of other Federal agencies, and private lands.  The work requires the use of vibroseis energy source; source holes are not a viable option.  The general requirements for this contract involve acquisition of high-quality reflection seismic data that may be processed into 3D coverage.  For a specific survey area, these data will be acquired in one continuous effort, not separated by a hiatus to perform other work.  The objective of the HWAD and HASF surveys is to obtain 82.5 x 82.5 sub-surface bin size at least 36-fold, 2 sweeps per VP.  These surveys will use an orthogonal, non-brick pattern.  It is anticipated that the actual survey will commence no later than ninety (90) days after contract award.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure from MJ Research, 5350 Capital Ct., #103, Reno, Nevada, 89502. A Real-time PCR - DNA Engine Opticon 1 System (single wavelength) to include Opticon 1 continuous fluorescence detector, DNA Engine Thermal Cycler chassis, and a 96-well Alpha unit that will be utilized by personnel from two different programs in the Biomedical Pathology Section. The system shall be used for: (1) Cellular interactions with Thrombospondin to investigate the mechanisms by which the adhesive glycoproteins TSP1 and TSP2 regulate tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis.  Accurate methods are required to validate each of these targets and to define the conditions that control expression of their mRNAs;  (2) Host Colonization and Vascular Dissemination of Candida albicans to provide information regarding the regulation of an essential gene in the human pathogenic fungus, C. albicans.  This protein will be used as a target to develop new antifungal drugs that may provide a new class of clinical reagents. Precise knowledge of the regulation of this gene is necessary to establish at what stages during infection the gene is required.  A continuous fluorescence detection system is required that utilizes a Peltier thermal cycler with multi-sensor/multi-zone temperature control technology, thermal accuracy of 0.3C, well-to-well uniformity of 0.4C, accommodating 96 samples, in plate or strip tube format, with programming of a thermal gradient of up to 24C, across the 96-well sample block (12 columns of different temperatures), yielding less than 0.4C variation from the predicted temperature. It also must have the capability to excite samples sequentially with 96 LEDs, and detect each signal via a
photomultiplier tube (PMT) individually, without any moving parts, in
order to ensure robustness of data collection. The DNA Engine Peltier thermal cycler manufactured by MJ Research meets these requirements and is currently the only technology with "Real-time PCR".  This is not a request for quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Control and Populations Studies, Cancer Statistics branch, Surveillance Research Program intends on entering into a sole source contract with the University of Virginia, P.O. Box 400195, Charlottesville, VA 22904 for the Creation of Breast Cancer Tissue Microarrays.  NCI is leading a project of population-based tissue collection that is based on convenience samples, facility-based tissue collection, or cohort tissue collection.  This process involves assembling hundreds of specimens on a single block, tissue micro array (TMA) technology for biomedical and epidemiological research.  A pathologist team from the University of Virginia (UVA), which included two pathologists and two technicians, performed the preparatory work for breast cancer pathology materials at the Hawaii Tumor Registry during the week of January 10 - 16, 2003.  This contract is to construct TMA blocks from those selected breast tissues.  TMAs are paraffin (wax) blocks that can contain up to a thousand, but more typically several hundred, samples of tissue.  These wax blocks are subsequently cut into thin sections that are placed on glass slides called histologic section that are then used in experimental assays.  The circled slides are used to sample the donor tissues with hollow needles (each sample referred to as a "tissue core") in a microarray apparatus, and then transferring the tissue cores to a recipient paraffin block to create the TMA.  A total of 44 blocks of TMAs will be manufactured with each constructed for 400 breast cancers.  Each TMA block set will be sectioned at UVA and 4 histologic sections per block (standard is 1, 52, 83 and 114) will be examined by a pathologist for quality assurance (QA) purposes.  The UVA has a TMA production facility currently employed in the construction of TMA under a cooperative agreement with the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute and is the only known institution to conduct this unique research.  This is not a request for competive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements unique features, it may submit a statement of capabilities.   The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) Energy Star Buildings Branch (ESBB)  intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the National Association of Counties (NACo) in Washington, DC under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain support from the NACo to facilitate counties in benchmarking the energy performance of their courthouses. EPA's ESBB has developed a  national energy performance rating system that allows building owners and operators to rate how well their buildings use energy on a numerical scale, which normalizes for weather and climate variations, as well as building and business characteristics. Well over 15,000 buildings have been  benchmarked using this rating tool, and EPA is about to release a new version of the tool which will, for the first time, specifically include courthouses. Under this requirement, NACo will disseminate this information to its network of counties across the country, educate them on the importance of  benchmarking energy performance, and implement a leadership role in energy efficiency improvement. NACo is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement due to the fact that it is the only national organization that represents county governments in the U.S. with membership totaling more than 2,000  counties, representing over eighty percent of the U.S. population. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541990. It has been determined that because of the ability of NACo to reach a majority of county governments and officials, and not only to disseminate the information on this energy  performance rating tool, but to encourage its use and to take action based on the results to promote energy efficiency, it is the only vendor uniquely qualified to meet this requirement. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of  meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this  notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The estimated magnitude of this procurement is not greater than $25,000.00. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via e-mail at rodgers.jami@epa.gov. Response Time: 12:00 PM EDT, September 8, 2003.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Tobacco Control Research Branch, TCRB, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences(DCCPS), plans on entering into a sole source contract with Oregon Health & Sciences University (OHSU), Pacific Center on Health and Tobacco(PCHT), 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97201 to assist in the implementation at the state level of strategies identified in the adult and youth blueprints.  Two major consensus documents have recently been developed in the areas of adult and youth tobacco use cessation; 1) A National Blueprint for Disseminating and Implementing Evidence-Based Clinical and Community Strategies to Promote Tobacco Use Cessation, September 2002 (“adult blueprint”) is to disseminate and implement tobacco cessation interventions that are effective among adults; 2) National Blueprint for Action on Youth and Young Adult Tobacco Use Cessation, Spring 2000 (“youth blueprint”) is to develop the science base on effective tobacco cessation interventions for youth.  The National Action Plan for Tobacco Cessation, prepared by the Subcommittee on Cessation of the DHHS Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health (ICSH), recommended establishment of a federally funded National Tobacco Quitlines network (quitline consortium) by FY 2005).  Such a quitline consortium will provide universal access to evidence-based counseling and medications for tobacco cessation and national portal to available state or regionally managed quitlines.  The formation of a quitlines consortium was recommended from The North American Conference of Smoking Cessation Quitlines, May 8-10, 2002, in Phoenix, Arizona, for which NCI was one of the co-sponsors.  The Centers for Disease Controls’s Quitline Resource Guide will provide direction for efforts pertaining to the quitline consortium.  The PCHT, via Oregon Health & Sciences University shall assist with implementation at the state level of strategies identified in the adult and youth blueprints.  The PCHT has the necessary experience required in assisting states with developing a comprehensive approach to statewide tobacco cessation, and is currently working with the Center for Tobacco Cessation (CTC).  The PCHT has worked collaboratively for over three years with representatives rom the five western states of Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona, and Hawaii, along with representatives from national partners including the CDC, the CTC, the SmokeLess States project, and the national Center for Tobacco-Free Kids. The purpose of the PCHT collaboration has been to pool data, resources, and experience in the development of a comprehensive statewide approach to tobacco cessation and implementation strategies.  The Pacific Center on Health and Tobacco is the only organization known to the NCI that can provide the necessary data, expertise and personnel to provide the required services.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement intends to award a sole source bridge contract to Choctaw Management Services Enterprise (CMSE) for the Record Support Services. The statutory authority for this sole source  procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) and 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1) (B) per FAR 6.302-1(2)(ii)(B). This is an interim action intended to ensure continuity of support by providing a temporary "bridge" contract between the Record Support Services contract  (COW-8-C-0002) and the competitively awarded successor for the Blanket Purchase Agreement for the Record Support Services to CMI Facilities Contractor pending resolution of the GAO protest.  The period of performance will be from October 1, 2003 through no later than March 31, 2004. The new contract will include a three-month base period with 1 three-month option period. The bridge contract will allow for a continuation of the services that were provided under legacy INS contract COW-8-C-0002.  The bridge contract is required to continue the services while the award is protested at Government Accounting Office (GAO) and for the orderly transition of the order under the competitively awarded BPA. Services under the current contract include records management support services provided to two records management entities: the DHS Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS) and the DHS Office of Records Management (ORM).  The safe, accurate, secure and timely management of the Service's records is critical to these two programs if they are to achieve their DHS mission.  It is in the best interest of DHS to have the aforementioned services performed without threat of disruption in service.  Numerous outside agencies, in particular law enforcement, greatly rely upon data compiled within our systems that would permit them to make rapid decisions regarding the status of immigrant and non-immigrant visitors to this country.  There are urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interest of the United States. These types of circumstances do not permit waiting for a decision to be made based on the merits of this protest. Therefore, it is crucial that the incumbent contractor continue performing Record Services Support functions until the protest situation has been resolved. Substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements for a critical system would result - i.e. a break in service for this critical system. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government shall consider all responses received by the date identified above. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please email the Contracting Officer with responses or questions regarding this requirement at Madan.kar@dhs.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Justice, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13, intends to issue separate sole-source Purchase Order to Joyce Brewer, in the Washington, D.C. vicinity, to provide technical support services to recommend/perform an approach to the design, development, testing and implementation of various financial applications on PC/LAN and Mainframe platforms interfacing to FMIS in the Teradata environment. The work consists of maintenance, user support, redesign and enhancement of the Debt Collection Module. It is critical to the Department s efforts to comply with the mandates imposed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 and it s self imposed Five-year Plan, to retain the services of contractors with detailed knowledge of the FMIS, the processes supported by the Debt Collection Management Module, the actual code comprising the modules, the multitude of modules supporting the payment, accounting and management reporting activities which comprise the services provided to the other organizations by the Finance Staff. The cost and the time to develop the requisite technical capabilities within other contractors would result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through full competition. Furthermore, this would delay the completion of the new systems and seriously jeopardize meeting deadlines. Ms. Brewer is uniquely qualified to perform this service by her years of experience with the FMIS, including specifically the development of the Debt Collection Management Module. Responses received as a result of this notice of intent shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses will not be considered as either proposal or quotations. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition, based upon the written responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received at the address above by COB 9/2/2003.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The Air Force Research Laboratory, Contracting Directorate, on behalf of the Space Vehicles Directorate, Spacecraft Technology Division, Spacecraft Component Technology Branch, Kirtland AFB, NM intends to award sole source, follow-on contracts to Boeing Space Systems (BSS) and Northrop Grumman Space Technologies (NGST) for the following described efforts based on technology developed and demonstrated by BSS and NGST under previously awarded open competition.


BACKGROUND: The history of Multi-Access Laser Space Terminal (MALST) is embedded in the Transformational Communications (TC) effort.  TC provides laser communications support for a diverse set of Airborne Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) platforms such as Global Hawk, U2 and MC2A.  Forecasted user needs project 6 vehicles in each of 2 theaters plus an additional 4 vehicles worldwide.  More current technology provides laser communications using single access heads that can handle one platform at a time.  Studies by contractors and the government have indicated that satisfying these needs with single access terminals involves unacceptable platform weight, power and cost. These factors drive the need for a combined space platform.  MALST is a space based optical laser communication system that can provide simultaneous laser communications with multiple airborne users. The objective of MALST is to achieve the desired capabilities at significantly reduced cost, weight and power, and is thus considered a critical enabling technology for the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA).


OBJECTIVE: The objective of this proposed contract is to:  Procure risk analysis, risk reduction breadboard development, and system requirements for the MALST program in the pursuant of achieving Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by FY08.  This effort will also take the program a large step toward eventual brassboard development by FY06 and prototype by FY08.  This contract is a meant to build upon the extensive analysis from the previous PRDA contract in FY03 to Boeing Space Systems and NGST.     

The period of performance for the above effort is 12 months with an anticipated start date of Jan 2004. Contracts will be awarded to Boeing Space Systems and Northrop Grumman Space Technologies (NGST), provided other sources cannot furnish the services at equivalent terms. Respondents are required to provide sufficient information concerning their ability to fulfill the above requirements within the period of performance in order for the project office to determine the requirements can be met. A draft program plan as well as resumes of key personnel must also be included in the response. Responses are limited to a total of 25 pages including program plan, resumes, attachments, diagrams, etc. Submit responses to Maj Jayne Faris, Det 8 PKVE, 2251 Maxwell Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773 no later than 15 calendar days after the date of this announcement by 4:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only two sources under authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 day of this notice. Firms responding should indicate if they are a Small Business, a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business, an 8(a) Certified Business, a Woman-Owned Business and/or a HUBZone Certified Small Business Concern. To be considered a Small Business the following applies: SIC 541710, size standard 1,000 employees. Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer or Project Manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers.  Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1 (800) 352-3572) http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for further information on certification and the approval process.  The offeror is required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with its proposal or to the Contracting Officer if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal. It is anticipated that a DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, with a classification level of Top Secret is required during the performance of this effort.

SYNESIS7 is currently under contract to develop a manufacturing process that combines a variety of software products and conversion methodologies to generate a Level IV Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) from paper technical manuals and utilize this process to manufacture Level IV IETMs for multiple aircraft platforms.  The modification will increase the number of paper technical manuals to be converted into Level IV IETMs and add expertise in NAVAIR's data type definitions (DTD).  This action will be negotiated on a sole source HUBZone basis with SYNESIS7.  SYNESIS7 is the only known responsible HUBZone source that can provide the required products and services that meet NATEC’s need for an easy to use, time-efficient technical publications digitization process (See numbered note #22 and 27).

Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

1. SOLICITATION NUMBER: 167-Pristina-PSC-FY03-05
2. ISSUANCE DATE: August 25, 2003
3. CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED  
    FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: September 22, 2003
4. POSITION TITLE: Local Government Program Advisor  – USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $72,381.00 - $94,098.00 per annum (GS 14 equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two Years
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

A. Background

Four years after devastating armed conflict in Kosovo, the reconstitution of a functioning economic, political, and cultural space is well underway.  Immediately following the conflict, donor priorities were placed on providing emergency assistance and establishing a secure environment in Kosovo.  Today, having addressed the immediate humanitarian needs following the end of the conflict, donor attention has turned to longer term support for institution-building, capacity-building, and promoting democratic and economic reforms.  Although the UN Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) retains many political powers in Kosovo, the transition to self-government has already begun at both the local and central levels of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG).  Municipal elections in  2000 and 2002 were considered free and fair by the international community, and the responsibilities of the elected municipal assemblies has been outlined in UNMIK regulations, most notably UNMIK Regulation 2000/45.  

Despite this progress, the roles, authorities and responsibilities of local governments remain confused and ill-defined.  In addition, many local officials lack the skills, knowledge or capacity to adequately plan, allocate and manage resources.  Local governments need to improve transparency, accountability, and formal mechanisms to encourage public participation.  Local governments also will need to take a more active role in addressing some of the most important issues facing Kosovo, including high unemployment, low level of economic development, and normalization and reintegration of minorities and internally displaced persons (IDPs).  

At the same time, the prospects are good for donor-funded local governance assistance projects to produce significant results.  Old governance structures were largely swept away prior to the conflict and new institutions are less burdened by the communist past.  Kosovar’s show an eagerness to accept assistance and advice from the international community, and particularly the US.  A recent public opinion survey by UNDP shows that Kosovar’s hold high trust and expectations for local government.  The international community has a short window of time before poor practices, rather than best practices, become institutionalized and cynicism toward local government grows among the Kosovar population.   

USAID’s new five-year strategic plan for Kosovo lists as one of its strategic objectives: “civil society and government are more effective partners in achieving good governance.”  To help achieve that objective, USAID/Kosovo is planning a new local governance strengthening initiative to begin approximately January 2004.  This multi-million dollar activity is expected to be a cornerstone of USAID/Kosovo’s Democracy and Governance portfolio for the next three to five years.  

The expected outcomes of the USAID/Kosovo local governance strengthening program will directly contribute to achieving results as laid forth in USAID’s Assistance Strategy for Kosovo.  Specifically, the program will contribute to Strategic Objectives  2.1 A civil society and government that are more effective partners in achieving good governance and 2.2 A more capable, transparent and responsive government acting according to the rule of law, and 1.3-2 Accelerated growth of the private sector.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Space Flight Qualified Near Infrared (NIR) focal Plane Arrays (FPA), which was posted on [August 13, 2003. You are notified that the following changes are made: Additional information is being provided to clarify the total noise requirement.  The requirement shown previously (&lt;6 e- rms) represents the noise of the entire Detector Subsystem that includes the focal plane array (FPA), the focal plane electronics (FPE), and the harness.  The required noise allocation of the FPA only is &lt;5 e- rms per pixel, which can be achieved using multiple reads over 1000 seconds at the FPA operating temperature.  The goal of &lt;2.5 e- rms per pixel remains the same as previously stated. The dark current requirement is being modified to correct for an oversight in the development of the Spectrometer specification.	The revised dark current requirement is 0.01 e-/sec. The revised Near Infrared Spectrometer Focal Plane Assembly Requirements Document, as well as, a letter that addresses the questions received in response to the R&D Sources Sought Notice for the NIRSpec requirement has been uploaded for review on the World WideWeb.

<CONTACT>Joy Dickson, 405-954-1015
<DESC>This is a follow-on to Announcement 3078 dated May 2, 2003.  Based on responses received, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined to narrow potential offerors to Small Businesses located within a 50-mile radius of the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) at the time of this announcement.  This limited geographical requirement is based on the considerable amount of time the contractor will be required to spend at the MMAC.  The contractor will interact on a daily basis with the Program Director of the FAA Logistics Center (FAALC), managers, and organizations. The FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Business Declaration form (Attachment 1) is required to be completed, signed, and submitted with your response to this SIR1. The FAA, MMAC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement to obtain writer and editor services for the FAALC.  The FAALC will utilize editor/writer services to market its products and services. The purpose of this requirement is to give the FAALC the capability to craft compelling ad text, develop professional brochure text, communicate to its customers, and prepare polished, professional communication materials for its employees.  The writer/editor will be required to write brochures and descriptions of the FAALC programs and capabilities, prepare and submit applications for national and agency awards, and develop proposals and briefings as described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW), Attachment 2. The FAA contemplates the use of an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract with time-and-material pricing arrangement and use of task orders.  The resultant contract has a potential duration of four (4) years including a base 1-year period with three (3) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the government.   This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) of 1997.  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Value to the FAA".  Best Value is defined as the Government's willingness to pay more for a superior proposal if there are added benefits, which justify the additional cost. This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This initial phase involves the announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit vendors to demonstrate their capabilities.  Evaluations involved in SIR1 will permit the FAA to down-select to a manageable number, not to exceed five (5), of offers permitting an efficient competition from among the most highly rated submissions.  SIR2 will incorporate the evaluation accomplished under SIR1 as well as evaluation of oral presentations with contract award based on overall best value to the FAA.  The remaining phase(s) of the down-select process will be identified in future communications with those firms who are among the top five (5).     Vendors that are interested and possess certain capabilities are to provide the specific information described below as to their unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this SIR.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  Documentation Limitations. Failure to comply with limitations cited herein may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  The vendor's proposal shall not exceed 50 pages.   A page is defined as one side of a "sheet".  All types of pages including but not limited to text, diagrams, exhibits, spreadsheets, schedules and attachments are included in the page limitation.  The FAA will neither read nor evaluate any information beyond the page limit specified.  A transmittal letter, cover page or table of contents is not included in the page limitation. Other Document Requirements are: 	(1)  Page Number Count.  A footer identifying the page number, and total number of pages should be put on the bottom of each page. 	(2)  The documentation considered by the submitter as proprietary shall be marked "Proprietary."  A cover sheet may be used for this designation along with the designation of the applicable page(s) the offeror deems competition sensitive. 	(3)  The vendor shall provide six copies. CAUTION:  FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Pages in excess of the stated limit will not be considered part of the evaluation.  The FAA has identified three (3) criteria that must be met by each vendor in order to warrant further consideration and advancement to any subsequent phase of the procurement process.  The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR. 1.  Past Performance and Experience: Offerors must demonstrate the quality and timeliness of its services as evidenced through its writing, editing, ad text, brochure development, graphics, conference booth advertising, etc. type products. For this requirement, a vendor must demonstrate a level in each area through at least four (4) and no more than eight (8) projects of similar complexity and magnitude to this effort performed within the past four (4) years.  The list shall include the administrative data identified below: 		(a) Offeror Name (Company/Division) 		(b) Contract Number and Contract Type 		(c) Contracting Agency or Business 		(d) Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) 		(e) Original completion date and final (or current) completion date 		(f) A brief description of the contract effort 		(g) Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the government Contracting Officer (procuring or administrative); for non-government contracts, provide the name, address, email address, telephone and FAX numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc.  The offeror is responsible for verifying references before submission to ensure all information is correct. 2.  Capability: Offerors must demonstrate their capabilities in providing writer/editor services of similar scope and magnitude of that identified in the SOW through contract work, ghost writing, direct experience, advertising, etc., on behalf of the public and quasi business organizations like the FAALC that have a combined government-business role and which need to communicate both internally and externally.  Offerors are to provide a portfolio consisting of, but not limited to, the description of their capabilities, the clientele served, references, and turn-around times of services performed within the past four (4) years. 3.  Knowledge/Understanding of FAA Requirement: Offerors shall demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the Writer/Editor services required to be performed for the FAALC as identified in the SOW.  Offerors must demonstrate an understanding and describe their ability to provide written materials, and written materials for web content, information releases, reports and applications, and briefings and exhibits.  Describe your experience in performing these types of services, as well as your knowledge of the FAALC's organizational structure. Technical Evaluation: The FAA will evaluate each vendor's submittal to determine its eligibility in the evaluation factors for the area of past performance and experience, capabilities, and knowledge/understanding of FAA requirement as described in 1, 2 and 3 above.  As part of the evaluation, the FAA will conduct checks of the vendor's references.  	(a)  Evaluation factors are listed in descending order and are of equal importance.  	Factor 1			Past Performance & Experience 	Factor 2			Capabilities 	Factor 3 		Knowledge/Understanding of FAA  			      Requirement 	(b) Factors will be rated by the evaluation team on the rating scale shown below.  Any offeror whose proposal does not achieve a rating of satisfactory or better in all factors may be considered ineligible and will not be considered for SIR2.  Team ratings for each factor will be weighted to establish a score for the technical proposal. 				4	= 	Excellent 				3	= 	Good 				2	= 	Satisfactory 				1	= 	Marginal 					0	= 	Unsatisfactory 	(c)  Evaluation criteria for each factor are as follow: 		(1) Factor 1 - Past Performance and Experience  The FAA will evaluate each offeror's relevant past and present performance.  The evaluation will consider information submitted pursuant to the evaluation criteria and other data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.  		(2) Factor 2 - Capabilities The FAA will evaluate each offerors portfolio to determine its accuracy, completeness, and its tie in with the FAALC approach and style.  Documentation must demonstrate experience in writer/editor services of similar scope and magnitude of that identified in the SOW.  		(3) Factor 3 - Knowledge/Understanding of FAA Requirement The FAA will evaluate the offeror's knowledge and understanding of the Writer/Editor services as set forth in the SOW and the ability or capability to perform these services.   CAUTION:  Vendors are cautioned that the FAA will use the data provided by other sources in evaluating past performance and experience.  References will be requested to complete a past performance questionnaire.  A questionnaire is attached (Attachment 3).   Vendors may not be given an opportunity to rebut information considered negative and relevant to the evaluation, if the information was obtained from other sources.  While the FAA may consider data from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance data rests with the vendor.

<DESC>NA QUESTION: Will there be any advance warning of an impending award as testing is performed on CLIN 0001 gloves? It is highly unlikely a domestic supplier could deliver the maximum 25,000 pairs within 120 days without advance knowledge of award. ANSWER: The solicitation states that the Government may exercise an option to procure a maximum quantity of 25,000 pairs of POL gloves (CLIN 0002) (within funding constraints) to one or two companies based on the evaluation criteria.  There is a potential that the 25,000 maximum quantity of the option may be split between two vendors.  Also, the solicitation states that the Government reserves the right to issue multiple orders up to the maximum quantity of 25,000 pairs of gloves. This means that the successful offeror(s) would received delivery orders over the life of the contract not to exceed the maximum option quantity set in CLIN 0002.

<DESC>NA INDEFINITE DELIVERY CONTRACT FOR ONE YEAR AND TWO ONE YEAR OPTIONS TO CONDUCT BIOLOGICAL SERVICES WITHIN THE MEMPHIS DISTRICT BOUNDARIES OR ASSIGNMENTS OF THE MEMPHIS DISTRICT. Corps maintenance and construction activities are ongoing in various watersheds within the Memphis District boundaries and include areas where threatened or endangered (T&E) species are known to occur.  These include the White River, the St. Francis River Basin, and other areas within the boundaries of the six states assigned to the Memphis District.  The Memphis District or its Contractor may also perform work related to endangered mussel populations in other localities outside the Memphis District boundar ies.   General Scope of Services:  The Contractor shall provide all personnel and equipment required to perform work that may include, but not be limited to, the following work items in accordance with specific task orders issued by the Contracting officer: a.  The Contractor shall, within 30 days after issuance of a task order, conduct surveys (qualitative and/or quantitative) in a manner agreed upon in each task order to determine the presence/absence of endangered mussels, provide density estimates of enda ngered mussels, translocate populations of endangered mussels, and provide other services that may be required by the Memphis District relating to endangered mussel populations.  Variables such as weather, flood events or other unforeseen circumstances may  delay implementation of work without penalty to the contractor.     		a-1.  Qualitative surveys will, at a minimum, survey all habitat types within the designated reach, and will allow sufficient time to ensure that all species inhabiting the reach have been identified.  		 		a-2.  Quantitative sampling will include a sufficient number of replicate samples to adequately estimate population densities of both T&E species and non-endangered mussels.  In streams with defined mussel beds, sampling will include establishing physica l limits of the bed.  The number of replicate samples required to adequately assess the densities and species composition will depend on the size of the bed.  These limits will be marked using a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit. 		a-3.  When translocating endangered mussels, sufficient personnel will be present to collect the required numbers of the target species from the reach.  Techniques employed will ensure maximum coverage of the substrate.  For example, personnel may be dep loyed in a line perpendicular with the channel in such a manner as to have a six-inch overlap in their survey area.  In this manner, the entire substrate can be covered without gaps.  Specific requirements relating to translocation will be described in the  Biological Opinion supplied by the USFWS.  Translocation reports will include total number collected, mortalities (if any), GPS data on translocation sites, numbers placed at each site (if appropriate), the number of trips the contractor made to transport  the mussels, average time to transport the mussels, temperature of water, and average water depths.   b.	Written assessments for environmental impact statements, environmental assessments, and biological assessments or other project documents. c.	Preparation of technical reports containing results of work items accomplished under this contract. d.	Study areas under this contract will be primarily within the limits of the Memphis District boundaries; however some work items may occur in other locations.  Specific project study areas will be stipulated in individual task orders.   DACW66-03-T-0082 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSUED TO TO DELETE THE FOLLOWING SAFETY SPECIFICATION FROM SOLICITATION NUMBER EA133F-03-RQ-0198 

"An alternative safety requirement to the 46 CFR Section 189.35-9 (c) (1) or 46 CFR Section 189.35-11 shall be installation of the specified cable as the weakest link in the winch system and a maximum brake holding capacity that does not exceed 4,000 lb.  In the event that the winch cable entangles with a stationary object and the Safe Working Load of the winch is exceeded, the following scenario should exist: The winch will hold tension up to the maximum capability of the brakes (not to exceed 4,000 lb).  Beyond this point, the brakes will slip, allowing the cable to render at this maximum tension of 4,000 lb.  Once the cable has been completely rendered, a low tension cable clamp shall allow 
the cable to slip free from the drum (at a tension not to exceed 4,000 lb), allowing the cable to continue overboard."

THE ABOVE STATEMENT IS HEREBY REMOVED FROM SOLICITATION, ALL OTHERS SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS REMAIN UNCHANGED.

At that time, the Government will present their needs and objectives. One-on-one sessions will be available beginning at 8:00 AM EST on 17 June 2003.  Each Company that had requested a one-on-one session should contact Ms. Janice Sullivan to reschedule.  Contact information is as follows: E-mail address:  Janice.Sullivan@hanscom.af.mil. Phone: (781)271-5485 All requests to reschedule one-on-one sessions should be made no later than 3:00 PM EST on 30 May 2003.

Overview:  AF 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, chapter 2, allows weapons simulators to be used to qualify personnel with weapons.  Weapons simulators are needed at all Air Combat Command (ACC) bases to provide continuing weapons qualification training when small arms ranges are closed for repair, ammunition is unavailable, or for northern tier bases when weather prohibits their use. During FY03 and FY04, 14 bases within ACC will be closing their ranges for major renovations. These renovations will last from weeks to months, according to the level of work being performed.  Considering ACC Combat Arms sections annually provide weapons qualification training to over 75K people, the lose of even a few days of training time can directly effect ours Wings arming ability. Weapons simulators can also be used to provide unique training opportunities for specific missions.  Units can use the systems to conduct judgmental training by the use of shoot-don't shoot scenarios or, by the use of authoring stations, they can create localized training scenarios to provide realistic training. AFI 36-2226 mandates simulator weapons must perform in all respects like actual weapons.  To meet the need of the command and AFI 36-2226 requirements, the following requirements were developed: 2.  Weapons requirements to be included in the price of the system: 2.1. System must have 10 M16A2 rifles, 10 M9 pistols, and 10 M4 carbines with flat top universal rails.2.2. Weapons must be capable of using owner installed optics, laser and inferred pointers as they were designed without interfering with system operations or affecting warranties. 2.3. Weapons, and system used to control weapons, must use accurate and validated ballistics for each type of weapon.  Ballistic data must have been previously validated by another federal agency.  Validation must be provided prior to award of contact. The fact other federal agencies use a system does not mean its ballistics have been validated. 2.4. Weapons must operate and function the same as actual service weapons.  System operator must have the ability, at any time during scenarios, to inject real time malfunctions/stoppages. 2.5.  Air supplied to the weapons must be supplied by a light weight, easily portable, low noise, air compressor that can be locally repaired or replaced with an off-the-shelf model, if needed. 2.6. When a weapon becomes unserviceable, to minimize training interruption the immediate availability of replacement weapons from the vendor is mandatory.  ACC owning unit will notify the vendor a replacement is needed and the vendor will immediately (within 24 hours) ship next day service a replacement weapon to the owning unit. 2.7. At a minimum, all weapons must have a one year warranty on parts, labor, shipping and handling.  
2.8. All weapons must have a minimum life expectancy of 225,000 rounds.
2.9. At a minimum, weapons and supporting systems must maintain a minimum in-commission rate of 85%. 3. Simulator requirements to be included in the price of the system: 3.1. Software and licenses must be assigned per system, not location or individual, and there must not be any restrictions to software use. This will allow systems to be relocated and different people to make modifications, if needed, in order to meet ACC’s future requirements and to allow software to be transferred to other similar ACC systems. Each system will be equipped with original copies of all programs used in the system in the event a system must be reloaded. 3.2. The system must be a complete “turnkey operation” to include all power cords, cables, and other items to make the system operational. 3.3. System must be able to operate on European or US electrical standards without the use of additional external transformers.  3.4.

3.5. Each system must have a built in capability to edit any and all scenarios or courses of fire (COF) used on the system.  Capability must allow for on-site, immediate customization and editing of scenarios/COF, ability to create infinite quantities of customized scenarios/COF, and the ability to create and edit localized specific scenarios/COF.  If special cameras, camcorders, accessory kits, or equipment is needed they will be provided by the vendor as part of the system. 3.6. Computer used to operate the system must use high speed processor and appropriate levels of memory to ensure no slipping, skipping, or pauses during scenarios/COF. 3.7. A high fidelity sound system must provide realistic sound and be fully controllable by the system operator at all times.
3.8. System must have global logistic and maintenance support capabilities in the event systems are deployed and require support. 3.9. System must have preloaded and ready-to-use AF-validated rifle Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC) of fire, the Tactical Rifle Qualification Course (TRQC) of fire, and pistol AFQC.  Courses of fire will be validated by ACC prior acceptance of systems. 3.10. System must allow for different weapons to be fired simultaneously off the same system during marksmanship, collective or judgmental training sessions.  System must also be capable of allowing single weapons to be fired without affecting the course of fire or scenario of other students.  This is needed when a single shooter must re-fire a phase or order of fire. 3.11. The system must have a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week help desk available for owners to access.  Help desk must be staffed with knowledgeable personnel who can walk the owner through oubleshooting steps. 3.12.  System must provide slow motion and real-time playback of scenarios and the shooters reactions, to include weapons tracking (both pre- and post-fire), weapon pitch, weapons cant, and scoring of hits. 3.13. Images must be projected by using a high fidelity projector. 3.14. Systems must be capable of providing individual and group data collection and storage.  Data must be able to be printed out via high speed color printer.
3.15. All scenarios must be contained within the system in a Windows-based format.  Scenarios and COF maybe loaded into the system, but run from tapes or disks. 
3.16. System must come with a one-year, on-site warrantee support covering all parts, labor, shipping and handling.  3.17. Vendor must provide, at a minimum, annual program updates and maintenance to program files. 3.18.  System must be capable of future expansion by adding on additional weapons, scenarios/COF’s, additional hardware or software with no risk to owning units of compatibility issues between old and new items. 
3.19. System operator must have the ability to view and provide physical feedback to students from the aggressors prospective.  This must in the form of reusable, non-marking projectiles that will inflict limited pain to students, but will not have enough force to break the skin. Must be equipped with a minimum of 100 projectiles between 40 and 70 caliber and be delivered by an air driven or electronic cannon. System operator must have the option of selecting single- or multiple-round firing capabilities. Camera associated with the shoot back capability must be in color and should be viewed on the same operator display being used to monitor the scenario/COF being run.
3.20. System must be fully equipped to create and author localized judgmental and collective training scenarios. Localized scenarios must be capable of providing slow motion and real-time feedback and hit scoring. 4. Training requirements to be included in the price of the system: 4.1. Each owning unit must be provided a minimum of a 1-day, on-site system operator course.  This course must educate operators on all aspects of the system. At a minimum they must be educated on set up, installation, operation, troubleshooting, and packing the weapons and the system for shipment.

The Secretary of the Navy has determined that the illegal possession or use of drugs and paraphernalia in a military setting contributes directly to military drug abuse and undermines command efforts to eliminate drug abuse among military personnel.  The policy of the Department of the Navy (including the Marine Corps) is to deter and detect drug offenses on military installations.  Measures taken to identify drug offenses on military installations and to prevent introduction of illegal drugs and paraphernalia include routine random inspection of personal possessions on entry or exit.  If there is probable cause to believe that the contractor has been engaged in use, possession, or trafficking of drugs, the contractor may be detained for a limited period of time until he or she can be removed from the installation or turned over to the local law enforcement personnel having jurisdiction.  When illegal drugs are discovered in the course of an inspection or search of a vehicle operated by a contractor, the contractor and vehicle may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary to surrender the individual and vehicle to appropriate civil law enforcement personnel.  Action may be taken to suspend working privileges as well as installation driving privileges.  Implicit with the acceptance of this contract is the agreement by the contractor to comply with all Federal and State laws as well as regulations issued by the commander of the military installation concerning illegal drugs and paraphernalia. FAILURE TO PERFORM:

Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC), under Prime Contract No. DE-AC28-01RW12101 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE) on the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) in support of the Office of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for award of a Subcontract to provide the technical services described below to pre-qualified bidders only.  The YMP is a monitored geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste that will be licensed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). 

To be deemed pre-qualified to receive an RFP, potential bidders must respond affirmatively to all seven (7) questions in the "Pre-Qualification Criteria" section below.

Summary Scope of Work:

The scope of work for this Subcontract will include furnishing technical expertise, supervision, labor, research and development capability for robotic, remote control, and automation design information for a highly radioactive and high temperature environment.  Final and advanced designs of remotely and autonomously operated vehicles will be done by others.  This work scope entails providing conceptual design options, technical review, and consulting capability to ensure that remotely operated systems meet a rigorous set of requirements pertaining to operations in a hazardous environment.  The Subcontractor will be an academic institution with a deep talent pool of researchers, students (both undergraduate and graduate), professors and others with a wide range of experience for developing new and innovative solutions to very complex robotic problems.

Specialized robotic and remotely operated equipment will be used on the surface and underground at a high-level nuclear waste repository.  Equipment will function near waste packages and high radiation areas containing different forms of commercial spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastes.  Robotic underground vehicles will venture into, take measurements, and then return safely from an environment that is hot (plus 360o F) and radioactive (plus 180 rad/hr).

Location of the Work:

Work shall be performed at the Subcontractorfs facilities unless otherwise directed by the Contractor.  All work shall be performed within the United States.


Period of Performance:

The estimated RFP issuance date is approximately September 15, 2003.  The anticipated planned date for award of the Subcontract is October 15, 2003, and the initial period of performance will be for one (1) year.   Extensions by mutual agreement could commence October 2004 with the potential for extensions for several years.  Work may be assigned as multiple tasks, each task having a defined scope of work, performance period and deliverable(s) requirements.

Subcontract Type:

It is anticipated that a fixed unit rate and task order type Subcontract will be awarded for this requirement.  This Subcontract is for an agreement with a "university partner" with BSC to provide services at an "academic institution" (staff, faculty, researchers, and students).  The RFP will contain specific Position Descriptions with a request for rates for each position.

Response Submittal:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15. ***The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339111 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  All interested offerors may submit a quote. ***

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research is a leading neutron scattering research facility that serves a community of scientists from around the world. Approximately one thousand guest researchers visit every year to perform experiments, putting a great demand on the performance of the general pool of sample environment equipment used to generate the proper temperature, pressure, magnetic field, etc. This sample environment equipment must perform with high reliability and accuracy, be simple to operate and maneuver, and be adequately protected from abuse by the inclusion of safeguards on its operation. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for one (1) Top-loading helium-3 cryostat with the following contract options: option to purchase up to two essentially identical systems over the next two years, (2) contractor shall provide the option for NIST to purchase spare or replacement parts, as necessary, over the next two (2) years, (3) provide the option to purchase an extended warranty. All interested parties are invited to submit a quote for the following line items:  LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each - Top-loading helium-3 cryostat in accordance with the following requirements and specifications; the entire system shall include the cryostat with top-loading sample capability, temperature controller, liquid helium cryogen level sensor and indicator (if applicable), connecting hoses and cables.  The system shall not include a vacuum pump for open-loop cooling with helium-4, as NIST shall provide this pump. NIST shall approve drawings before manufacture and shall be given a copy of line drawings (not all manufacturing drawings) for the system. Two (2) copies of the operating manual shall be included with every system.  The offered system shall be based on either a liquid helium cryostat or a closed-cycle cryogen-free system.  

Performance specifications: 1) controlled sample temperature range: 0.5 - 300 K, 2) shall maintain base temperature for a minimum period of 24 hours, 3) liquid helium and liquid nitrogen reservoirs, if used, shall last at least 30 hours when operating at base temperature, 4) minimum sample space diameter: 45 mm, 5) complete temperature control system shall include sensors, heaters, temperature controller, and connecting cables, 6) temperature control shall be stable to within 0.1 degrees Kelvin below 10 K, within 1 % above 10 K, 7) sample shall be in vacuum or a static volume of exchange gas. The exclusive choice of vacuum or exchange gas is not required throughout the entire operating range. For example, exchange gas may be used at high temperatures and vacuum at low temperatures as a normal operating procedure, 8) temperature sensor accuracy at the sample position: +/- 250 mK for T < 25 K, +/- 1% for T > 25 K.  Multiple sensors may be employed, 9) no sensors shall be repositioned throughout the operating temperature range, 10) time required for sample mount to reach base temperature after insertion into a cold cryostat shall be a maximum of 5 hours. This is a measure of the time required for sample changes.

Facility interface specifications: 1) cryostat shall mount onto a goniometer. The square-mounting surface shall be 250 mm on an edge. There are 4x M6 tapped holes in the goniometer mounting surface, arranged on a 230 mm bolt square (325.3 mm bolt circle diameter), 2) the temperature controller shall provide RS-232 serial connection communication capability, 3) cables and hoses to support equipment such as temperature controllers shall extend at least 15 feet from the cryostat, 4) the cryostat shall provide for the capability to be lifted by an overhead crane or hoist, 5) electrical power requirement: must run on 30A, 220V single phase (NEMA L7-30); 20A, 208V three-phase (NEMA L21-20); or 20A, 120V single phase power (NEMA L5-20), 6) electrical power connections shall extend at least 3 meters from equipment to power outlets, 7) cooling water requirement shall not exceed a maximum flow rate of 7 gpm at 40 psi with connection to a chilled water source.  

Neutron scattering requirements: The term sample stick refers to the part of the system used in top-loading the sample mount. The sample stick may include the cryogenic insert according to the design of the offered system. 1) Sample space shall accommodate a maximum sample diameter of 45 mm, 2) cryostat shall provide 360 degree access to the sample in the horizontal scattering plane without intersecting any liquid cryogens or any part of the cooling system, 3) sample mounting position shall be 1.75 inches above neutron beam center, 4) sample stick shall be able to be locked against rotation, 5) sample stick is not required to be height adjustable, but +/- 1.5 inches adjustment capability from nominal position is preferred, 6) horizontal neutron scattering plane centerline shall be 6 inches above the base flange, with an overall beam height of 3 inches,  7) thinned aluminum or aluminum alloy windows shall be used in the neutron scattering plane with a maximum total thickness of 0.100 inches of material between the sample position and the exterior of the cryostat, 8) connection to sample shall be via a 5/16-18 threaded stud on the vendor's equipment with a maximum length of 0.375 inches. 

In addition, there are less stringent demands on the size of the entire cryostat. As a guide, the entire cryostat should not exceed a diameter of 10 inches in the neutron beam path. Above the neutron beam path, the cryostat should be less than 24 inches in diameter. The overall height should not exceed 6 feet in a running configuration, and NIST has ample overhead clearance for removing cryogenic inserts, etc. The figures just listed are guidelines only, and are not inviolable requirements.

OPTION 0002: Quantity Not to Exceed (NTE) two (2) each - Identical cryostats as identified in Line item 0001 within a two (2) year period. Any modifications requested by NIST shall be allowed that do not alter the essential characteristics of the system and shall be approved by NIST.  

Option 0003 - Option to purchase an extended warranty. 

Option 0004 - Quantity Not To Exceed (NTE) three 3) each - Helium level sensor

DELIVERY SHALL BE FOB DESTINATION.  Delivery is required within 10 months after drawing approval by the Government. *** The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.   

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1)Technical Capability factors that adhere to the technical specifications, user-friendly temperature control, cryogen maintenance specification requirements, and robust design.  User-friendly temperature control, cryogen maintenance requirements, and robust design are inherently germane to the use of the system by NIST personnel. User-friendly temperature control that is easy to operate, either through simple and objective procedures or a uniform interface, shall be judged more highly. Additionally, Cryogen maintenance requirements refer to both the periodic need to refill liquid cryogens (nitrogen and helium) and the periodic need to recycle closed-loop cryogenic helium-3.  Systems that operate for longer periods between cryogen maintenance shall be judged more highly. Robust design elements are those that enable enhanced reliability, lower risk in operation, or simple, inexpensive repair capability. Systems that incorporate these elements shall be judged more highly. 2) Past performance and 3) Price.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The selection factors for this RFQ are adherence to the technical specifications, user-friendly temperature control, cryogen maintenance requirements, past performance and price.*** 

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Offerors shall include the make and model of the product, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which clearly documents that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated above.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or information provided by NIST and its affiliates.  Offerors shall provide a list of at least THREE (3) REFERENCES to whom the same or similar products have been sold.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed. Past Performance shall be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service provided by the Contractor.  Offerors with no relevant past performance shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. ***

<CONTACT>Robin Revard, 817.886.1053
<DESC>NA Point of Contact for this Sources Sought is Valerie J. Sands (817) 886-1050 This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  No proposals are being requested with this synopsis.    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District has been tasked to solicit for and award Nationwide Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCS) for Construct ion and Services Primarily at 74 Air Force Health Facilities Located in the CONUS and Including Hawaii and Alaska.  Proposed MATOCS will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Type contracts.  Total number of contracts to be awa rded, and the size and type of the set aside portion(s) will depend upon the responses to this synopsis.  The MATOCS are intended to service primarily the Air Force; however, other customers may utilize these contracts also, upon approval from the Air Forc e. The intent is to select a pool of contractors that are highly qualified and experienced in the design and construction of medical facilities (e.g., contractors with strong in-house design capability and/or long standing partnership with A-E firm(s) working  primarily in a medical facility design-build environment). This pool of contractors will compete for task order work across the nation. The contractor pool will be divided into two categories (i.e. set-aside contractors and unrestricted contractors). Cont actors in the set-aside category will only compete among themselves, and contractors in the unrestricted category will only compete among themselves for task order work assigned to their respective categories. Set-aside contractors will not compete against  unrestricted contractors for task order work. In order to minimize the contract administration burden to the Government, and maximize potential of contractor success, the Government prefers to minimize the number of contractors in the contractor pool but still ensure there is adequate competition. The  number of contractors required to satisfy the minimum competition requirements in each category is at least two (2) contractors per category (i.e. two contractors in the set-aside category and two contractors in the unrestricted category). Ideally, the Go vernment desires that each contractor in the pool be capable of successfully executing work at any of the CONUS locations, including those in Hawaii and Alaska. Depending upon the responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis, the Government will decide whether to (or how best to) divide the nation into regions to be covered by the MATOCS.  The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the MATOC contr actors, in each region, for task orders issued against the MATOCS, for work to be performed in that region.  If it is necessary to divide the nation into regions, the Government intends to stay with the smallest number of regions as possible because, as th e number of regions increases, there is the potential that the contract administration burden will also increase, along with the dilution of the project and contract capacity base among the contractors.  Prime contractors who are awarded MATOCS that have b een 100% set-aside (e.g., for 8a) will compete against other 8(a) contractors, but not against the unrestricted contractors.  No task orders will be awarded to unqualified contractors or at a price that the Government feels is not fair and reasonable. Each MATOC will not exceed 60 months (5 years) after date of award.  Estimated dollar value (capacity) of all MATOCS combined is $200 Million (Base Year plus four Option Years).  Estimated annual amount (capacity) of all MATOCS combined is $40 Million.The estimated annual amount of each MATOC will depend upon how many MATOCS are ultimately awarded and the number and amount of any set-asides.  Every MATOC that is awarded may not have the same total estimated contract value over the five (5) year period. A Two-Phase Request For Proposal solicitation process will be used.  Price proposals will only be requested from the highest techni cally qualified offerors.  Basic MATOC awards will be based on overall Best Value to the Government.  Task orders may be issued as Firm-Fixed-Price (construction only), Design-Build, Design-Build Plus, and Unpriced Task Orders.  The Government intends to c ompete the task orders; however, sole source task orders may be issued under certain circumstances as specified in the solicitation.  Depending upon their dollar value and complexity, task order awards may be based upon lowest price (Request for Bids) or u pon Ã¢Â€Âœbest valueÃ¢Â€Â to the Government (Request for Proposals).  Estimated solicitation issued date will be 21 Nov 03, and estimated proposal due date will be 12 Jan 04.  Official Synopsis citing the solicitation number, and inviting Offerors to regi ster electronically to receive a copy of the solicitation when it is issued, will be issued on or about 4 Nov 03. Construction and services to be performed under the MATOCS will primarily be renovation, but may also include major repair and new construction.  Work will include, but is not limited to the following:  replacement, restoration or modernization of hospital s, clinics, medical administration buildings, ambulatory health facilities, medical warehouses, veterinary clinics, wellness centers and any other buildings connected to/associated with the health facilities.  Air Force restoration and modernization projec ts typically include planning, design and installation and/or construction of the following systems:  HVAC, medical gas, plumbing, electrical, elevators, building envelope, fire protection, total renovation and terrorism/force protection.     North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  Small Business Size Standard for this acquisition is $28.5 Million.  Federal Supply Code is Z149, Ma intenance, Repair or Alteration of Real Property, Other Hospital Facilities.  Under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 25% of the contract work with his/her own employees.  Off erors who plan to team or joint/venture with another firm, in order to bid on the MATOCS, are also encouraged to respond to this synopsis.  Prior Government contract work is not required for bidding on the MATOCS. Offerors response to this Synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages and shall include the following information: Offerors name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address. Offerors interest in bidding on the solicitation when it is issued. Offerors capability to perform a contract of this magnitude and complexity (include offerors in-house capability to execute design and construction, long standing partnership with A-E firm(s) working primarily in a medical facility design-build environment , comparable work performed within the past 5 years Ã¢Â€Â“ brief description of the project, customer name, and dollar value of the project). Offerors Business Size (Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8a Firm, HUBZone, Woman-Owned, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned) Offerors recommendation for whether to (or best way to) divide the geographic area to be covered by these services (e.g. Five Regions - Eastern U.S., Central U.S. Western U.S., Alaska, & Hawaii), in order to maximize the competition on this acquisition, mi nimize Government administration burden, and maximize potential for contractor success at the task order level.   Offerors statement regarding which regions the offeror could (and would) bid on. Offerors questions and concerns regarding the performance of a contract of this magnitude and complexity (e.g. bonding, subcontracting, etc.), and offerors suggestions as to how the solicitation could be structured, so that the problem/concern could be mit igated or resolved.

<DESC>NOTE:  This is a reposting of the previous Sources Sought Notice originally published on June 27, 2003, and extended on August 4, 2003 as Amendment No. 1, which was inadvertently removed recently.

17.   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is seeking a contractor to conduct the NRC's Package Performance Study (PPS) research program.  The PPS is a study of the response of spent nuclear fuel transportation casks to extreme accident conditions.  The principal activities under a resultant contract will be the preparation of a detailed program plan and the implementation of the plan following NRC approval.  The plan tasks will include analyses and prediction of the physical response of a rail cask and a truck cask for full-scale impact and thermal testing under extreme accident conditions.  Any potential contractor would be expected to have in-house capabilities to conduct the requisite finite element analyses and access to a test site on which impact and fire test facilities could be constructed if the contractor does not currently have them.  (In NUREG-1768, entitled, "United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission Package Performance Study Test Protocols" which was published as a draft for comment, the NRC staff proposed a 75 mph impact for both full-scale casks and a fully engulfing hydrocarbon-fuel fire for more than 30 minutes.  The impact test would likely be from a tower about 300 ft tall.  NUREG-1768 is available on the NRC website - www.nrc.gov.)

The contractor chosen to perform this work must demonstrate expertise and experience in the development and implementation of large scale tests - experience specifically working with spent nuclear fuel transportation casks is a strength.  The program will require a nuclear grade QA plan.  Please provide a few pertinent examples when responding to this sources sought request.  

The level of effort estimated for this work is 24 staff-years over a period of five years.

Potential Conflicts of Interest: The respondents are requested to identify any current or planned contracts or projects dealing with the NRC regulated nuclear power industry and/or Department of Energy (DOE), in general, the Yucca Mountain Repository project, and DOE's prime contractor, Bechtel SAIC, in particular.

Potential sources shall provide a letter of interest, a capability statement, and resumes showing capability to perform the work.  Respondents shall send this information to Deborah Neff, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.  The closing date for responses is September 4, 2003.  This synopsis is not a request for proposal.  A Request for Proposal will be issued to those firms deemed capable.  Whose who responded previously do not need to respond again.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division is seeking potential sources to support the Chief of Naval Aviation Training’s (CNATRA) TC-12B pilot training program currently supported by Government and contractor personnel and equipment.  The TC-12B is a Navy configured Raytheon/Beechcraft King Air BE-200 aircraft.  A sources sought notice was recently issued on 25 June 2003 for the leasing of two (2) TC-12B flight training devices (FTDs) for CNATRA, however, the scope of this requirement has changed based on further consideration.  Details regarding this revised requirement are provided in the paragraphs that follow.

CNATRA requires the following individual pilot training courses:  
	
1)	Intermediate E2/C2 MPTS Flight Training (CNATRAINST 1542.152).  The purpose of the Intermediate E2/C2 MPTS Flight Training is to develop multi-engine flight skills while emphasizing instrument flying and crew coordination.  Students will enter Advanced E2/C2 MPTS Training after successful completion.
  
2)	Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training (CNATRAINST 1542.147).  The purpose of the Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training is to develop multi-engine flight skills while emphasizing instrument flying and crew coordination.  At the successful completion of this training the flight student will be designated a naval aviator or USAF pilot qualified in multi-engine aircraft, and will have earned a standard instrument rating.  
   
3)	Multi-Engine Flight Instructor and Transition Training (CNATRAINST 1542.153).  The purpose of the Multi-Engine Flight Instructor and Transition Training is to provide designated aviators with appropriate flight procedures, instructional methodologies and techniques to instruct undergraduate flight students in the Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS and Intermediate E2/C2 phases of flight training.  The Transition Training will prepare designated pilots with dissimilar flying experience for Naval Test Pilot School or for duty with a Maritime Patrol Fleet Replacement Squadron.    

These TC-12B training courses require both classroom academic and practical training.  To support these training courses, the contractor shall provide all certified instructors; two (2) TC-12B FTDs for practical training; support personnel required to operate and maintain the devices; and any additional labor required for supervising and administering classroom and simulator training.  Additionally, the contractor will be required to provide data rights for any contractor-specific materials for this contracted training.  

All instructors shall have a minimum of 1000 flight hours, have knowledge of Department of Defense (DOD) rules and regulations governing aircraft operations, and be either a prior military pilot or possess an FAA flight instructor certificate with an instrument rating.  The FTDs required shall simulate the performance and functional operation of the TC-12B aircraft and shall minimally meet FAA Level 6 FTD certification requirements as defined under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-45A (FAA certification is not required).  In addition, the FTDs shall provide a freeze and reset capability and a minimum of a three-channel visual system capable of projecting a minimum 200-degree horizontal by a 40-degree vertical field of view and simulate VMC, IMC, day, and night conditions.  

All training will take place in the Government-furnished facility located in Building 1824 at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas.  This facility is capable of supporting two (2) TC-12B FTDs and associated contractor personnel.  Information regarding a site visit will be announced separately at a later date.  The Government will also provide all required course curriculums/syllabi and any additional Government-specific courseware/materials needed for the training of TC-12B pilots.  NOTE:  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL USE THE GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED FACILITIES AND COURSE CURRICULUMS/SYLLABI IN CONDUCTING ALL TRAINING.  

Businesses capable of accomplishing the required services are invited to submit the following:
1)	Company literature, brochures, or capability summaries.
2)	Business size (i.e., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) certified business, woman-owned business, etc).  For purposes of reporting business size, the applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 611512 with a size standard of $21.5 million.  Please identify business size on cover sheet or first page of submission.
3)	Past and/or current performance on similar contracts (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact).  Please limit past and/or current performance to the last 3 years.

The responses will serve as a basis for the Government’s decision to establish this requirement as an 8(a), Small Business Set-Aside, or Unrestricted requirement.  Those businesses that previously submitted information in response to the 25 June 2003 sources sought for the leasing of the FTDs, and are capable of meeting the revised requirement, need only submit past and/or current performance on similar contracts.  Information should be sent via e-mail to roxy.campos@navy.mil and scott.syring@navy.mil.  Alternative submittal methods are via facsimile to (407) 380-4420 or by mail to:  NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division, ATTN:  Code 25323 (R. Campos), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3275.  Responses are requested on September 5, 2003.  The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, nor for the Government to pay for the information received.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to the Contract Specialists, Roxy Campos (roxy.campos@navy.mil or 407-380-4784) or Scott Syring (scott.syring@navy.mil or 407-380-4865).

<SUBJECT>Information Warfare Defend Program / Information Assurance
<DESC>NA The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to award a bridge modification to extend the period of performance for six months on contract N00039-99-C-3103 with Booz, Allen and Hamilton (BAH) with an estimated corresponding increase in the number of staff hours to be procured (126,350). The extended period of performance will run from October 1, 2003 through March 31, 2004.  This contract provides Information Assurance (IA) Security Systems Engineering Services and Technical and Managerial support services for the Navy?s Information Warfare-Defend (IW-D) Program, managed by SPAWAR Code PMW 161. SPAWAR is not competing this requirement, as BAH is the only responsible source capable of providing these highly specialized services during this period of time without the Navy incurring unacceptable delays in implementing IA aboard ships and at shore commands.  The Request for Proposals (RFP) for SPAWAR?s follow-on full-and-open-competitive IA procurement (Solicitation # N00039-03-R-0015) remains planned and is expected to be released in the first quarter of FY04.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis-solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The proposed procurement will be conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Subpart 13.5. This solicitation is being conducted under full and open competition. The following FAR and AIDAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference. FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Oct 2000); FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (see evaluation factors below); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (July 2002); FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Feb 2002); FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (May 2002), and AIDAR 752.7000 Marking (Jan 1993). An offeror should include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer. The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Mission for Central Asia Republics, Almaty (USAID/CAR) solicits proposals from the parties interested in participation in its program “Gonorrhea Susceptibility Testing in Kyrgyzstan”. The US Government plans to assist the Government of Kyrgyzstan to establish treatment  for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at primary health care level using World Health Organization syndromic management of STI approach in support of its Strategic Objective of increased utilization of quality primary health care for select populations. For this reason USAID anticipates making a single award to a laboratory expert on gonorrhea (GC) testing who will help to select a lab in Bishkek for GC susceptibility testing and sites for specimen collection, determine need for equipment and reagents, train the lab staff, monitor results of training, develop plan for susceptibility testing, establish and implement external proficiency control panels, analyze GC susceptibility data and produce a report on results. Background: A study conducted in 1999 in Bishkek by the French-based organization Medecins Sans Frontiers found that 25% or more GC isolates from the Bishkek area were resistant to all antibiotics but ceftriaxone, cefixime and spectinomycin, all relatively expensive. In order to adequately treat GC using a syndromic approach, it is critical to identify the most appropriate antibiotics to use. In addition, should the resistance patterns have changed in the last few years enabling less costly drugs to be used to treat GC, more patients would have access to treatment. Finally, it has been established that people with untreated STIs are more susceptible to HIV infection, so it is very important that STIs be properly treated and cured. Site Selection:  Neither the Government of Kyrgyzstan nor most of its people, at present, have the funds for both GC testing and treatment. Therefore, the syndromic approach to treatment is most practical under current economic conditions. Proper adjustment of the treatment recommendations for the rethral/vaginal discharge component of the syndromic guideline will require periodic surveillance and testing for antibiotic resistance. Such periodic surveillance should be the function of the Sanitary and Epidemiologic Service (SES), rather than a lab in the curative sector. Hence, the US Government would prefer that location of this GC susceptibility testing would be in the SES, if feasible. Objectives: Establish GC susceptibility patterns in Kyrgyzstan which will form the basis for revising the treatment recommendations for the urethral/vaginal discharge component of the Syndromic Management of Sexually Transmitted Diseases guideline to be used nationally. Contractor tasks: The contractor shall make at least three visits to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan and may travel to additional sites within Kyrgyzstan to perform the following tasks. Visit 1 tasks: 1.  Assess laboratories in Bishkek (at least three) and advise USAID on selection of a lab best suited to provide GC susceptibility testing in Kyrgyzstan. Possible candidates include: a) the Microbiology Department Lab at the Kyrgyz State Medical Academy; b) a Sanitary and Epidemiologic Lab for STI testing; or c) the lab of the Republican Dermato-Venereology Institute.  Selection of a lab should be conducted in an open and impartial manner. The expert should prepare a survey form for the assessment, addressing human resources, technical capacity, communications capacity, specimen handling and transport capabilities. Results of this assessment should be discussed with USAID and the final decision will be made in consultation with USAID. 2.  Determine the selected lab’s training needs in both identification of GC and GC susceptibility testing for the purpose of designing a training course. 3.  Advise USAID on the appropriate number of GC susceptibility tests needed and the number  and geographic range of locations from which tests must be obtained in order to appropriately revise the treatment recommendations for the urethral/vaginal discharge component of the Syndromic Management of Sexually Transmitted Diseases guideline to be used nationally. Advise USAID on options for obtaining specimens, whether from the curative sector or through periodic surveys, including advantages and disadvantages of these options.4.  Identification of sites may require travel to Osh and Djalalabad in South Kyrgyzstan or other locations as needed. 5. Identify sites/sources for specimen collection and any training needs at collection sites to ensure that specimens are successfully collected, isolated, and appropriately transported. 6. Identify 1-2 clinical specialists to be trained for monitoring specimen collection and other quality components. 7.  Advise USAID on the number of tests that should be transported out of country for re-testing and the cost of such external testing. 8. Specify type and quantity of additional equipment/reagents, test kits, and other supplies needed to accomplish collection, transport, and testing of specimens and provide this information to USAID so a separate procurement can be initiated. Include in this list any supplies needed if specimens from sites other than Bishkek must be obtained and transported. Off-site tasks: design a training program to meet the needs of the selected lab such that, post-training, the lab can accurately test specimens for GC and test positive specimens for susceptibility to specific antibiotics; prepare materials requiring translation in advance and submit to USAID for translation; design a training program, if needed, for staff at collection sites to ensure specimens are successfully collected, isolated, and appropriately transported; prepare materials requiring translation in advance and submit to USAID for translation. Visit 2 tasks: 1. Provide needed training to selected lab on testing specimens for GC and on GC susceptibility testing, including training on any new equipment, new reagents or test kits, and on transport of specimens should this be necessary. Training should result in X proficiency being achieved by laboratorians in organism identification and susceptibility testing. (The consultant should  propose an appropriate proficiency level to indicate training effectiveness, as well as the rationale for selecting the proposed level). 2. Train identified clinical specialists to monitor specimen collection and other quality components. 3. Travel with clinical specialists to collection sites and provide training, as needed, to staff  on collection, isolation, and transport of specimens, including training on any new equipment, reagents, test kits, or transport devices.  Training should result in X proficiency being achieved by laboratorians in collection, isolation, and transport of specimens. (The consultant should propose an appropriate proficiency level to indicate training effectiveness, as well as the rationale for selecting the proposed level.). 4. Set up a study of GC resistance patterns and assist selected lab and collection sites in implementing this study once x level of proficiency has been achieved. Visit 3 tasks: 1. Monitor lab proficiency on testing specimens for GC and on GC susceptibility testing. 2.

The liquid feed will be introduced via computer controlled positive displacement pump(0-10 ml/min). Feeds One multiport valve shall be included to permit reactant bypass of the reactor. This valve shall provide a convenient means of performing analytical sampling and possible calibration of the feed material and shall be incorporated as an additional request or by a failsafe condition being automatically activated, a high pressure, inert gas safety feature. When the reactor is placed in the "by-pass" position, either by operator request or by a failsafe condition being automatically activated, a high pressure, inert gas stream shall be activated to purge the reactor contents to a safe vent. Gas/Liquid Separation The unit shall also be equipped with a condenser and knockout vessel in order to remove the steam prior to analytical sample ports. Reactor Specifications The main reactor shall consist of an inner quartz section and an outer metal section. The quartz inner tube shall be manufactured with a lower and upper section. The lower section shall have an inner diameter of 2.25? and a heated length of at least 13?. The upper section shall have an inner diameter of approximately 4?. The height of the upper section shall be maximized to reduce the possibility of carry-over of the catalyst. The reactor shall allow the user to operate the reactor in both an up-flow and down flow modes. The reactor shall also be able to run both fixed and fluidized bed tests. The reactor top shall be designed with freeboard space in order to prevent particle elutriation from the reactor into the rest of the system. Fluid bed testing shall be done on particles ranging from 75-100 microns at a space velocity of 2000 h- . Fixed bed testing shall reach a maximum space velocity of 10,000 h-. Process Conditions: Regeneration ? 25 psig @ 1200 deg. F (up flow) Sulfidation ? 280 psi @ 600 deg. F (downflow) Maximum Operating Conditions: 280 psi at 1,450oF Reactor temperature control shall be handled using a Type K thermocouple located in a thermowell. System pressure shall be controlled by a back pressure control valve(0-300 psig). Heating Process lines, valves, etc. shall be heated to maintain process lines above saturation temperature. Expected steam generation shall be at least 25% by vol. Analytical The unit shall also provide capabilities for GC and/or mass spectrometer ports. These ports shall be located on the on the reactor effluent stream in order to sample outlet concentrations. There shall also be a sample port strategically placed in order to allow for the sampling of the inlet gas streams as well as mass spectrometer calibration. Automation The multiport valve, back-pressure control valve, and all mass feeds shall be automated so that they can be actuated via computer interface. This interface shall also allow for viewing data acquisition, reactor overview, recipes which allow for setting reactor set points for specific durations, and alarms. Failsafe All control loops (pressure, temperature, flow) shall be monitored for nonideal operating conditions. Safety management inputs include: power failure, high temperature limits, sensor burn-out and shorting, high flow limits, and high pressure limits. Simultaneous safety management outputs during a shutdown include: turning off power to heaters, shutting off all reactant feed streams constant purge of valve ovens, and switch reactor off-line to bypass/purge. A rupture disc shall also be added for additional protection. Services Technical services shall be offered as well. These shall include a 1 year warranty with either onsite(preferably) or offsite hands-on training. Documentation All appropriate P&IDs, and manufacturer?s test reports shall be included in the delivery package.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is R69-7MN1-02 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is a small business set-aside;  The NAICS is 334516, business size 500 employees.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, requests the procurement of sequencing services for 20,000 ESTs from a normalized cDNA library synthesized from Boophilus microplus.  The use of modern molecular approaches for designing novel methods of tick control require increased knowledge in the identification and quantification of expressed genes in the tick and the role specific genes may play in tick development and survival of various stresses encountered by the tick, including dessication, cold, and pesticide exposure.  As an initial step in assembling a database of expressed tick genes, a tick cDNA library has been synthesized which contains genes activated by various environmental perturbations and genes expressed in various lifestages of the tick.  The objective of this research is to obtain sequence information from genes expressed in the tick with the longer-term goal of relating the expression or activation of specific genes to specific environmental cues.  Approach: Expressed sequence tag (EST) data will be compiled into a database of expressed tick genes.  Clones from the tick cDNA library will be sequenced from both the 5' and 3' ends using standard sequencing primers.  The sequence information will be auto-annotated and putative gene identification assigned.  The EST database will be used to build a gene index for Boophilus microplus, assembling sequences into tentative consensus sequences and singletons.  Specifications: (1) receive and store the normalized cDNA library; (2) plate the library on selective media, picking bacterial colonies containing cDNA inserts, and preparing DNA for sequencing; (3) Perform 5' and 3' sequencing (20,000 reactions in total); (4) Auto-annotate sequence data, searching for putative open reading frames; (5) Provide sequence information in flat files with putative gene identification when possible; (6) Build a gene index of Boophilus microplus using these ESTs.  The Sequencing information shall be delivered to the USDA, Agricultural Research Service, 2700 Fredericksburg Rd, Kerrville, TX 78028.  The Government “REQUIRES” delivery no later than 90 days after receipt of order, however, each offeror shall include their proposed delivery schedule as part of their quotation.

2.0	WORK REQUIREMENTS

A.	Background

The US Air Force Force Protection Battlelab’s (FPB) charter is to rethink and develop new policies, doctrine, and tactics in the area of force protection.  In order to achieve its mission, the FPB is looking to industry for solutions to some of the Battlelab’s initiatives.  These solutions can be material solutions, a concept or a new process.
	One of the initiatives the FPB is undertaking is proving the military worth of using sub-tactical Remotely Controlled Aerial Vehicles (RCAVs) to apply pesticides.

The government is seeking to procure a RCAV that meets the following criteria:

1.	Must be capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and be launched without the use of any mechanical launching device (e.g., no catapult).
2.	Must come with and fit into reusable cases that can be transported by commercial aircraft and that can be lifted by 2 people.
3.	Must be powered by a fuel source that can be transported by commercial aircraft (diesel or jet fuel is preferred).
4.	Must have a remote-relayed night vision capability that enables users on the ground to monitor for obstacles, especially during night flying (e.g., Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), topography-based digital guidance, or low-light/no-light imaging).
5.	Must be capable of “auto-stabilization” and fully autonomous flight.
6.	Must be available for delivery within 45 days after receipt of order (ARO).
7.	Must be a “field tested” airframe, meaning that it has already been flown.
8.	Must have a minimum flight endurance time of one hour.
9.	Must not require extensive aviation knowledge to operate.
10.	Must have a minimum range of 4 kilometers from its ground station.
11.	Must be operated by no more than two personnel.
12.	Must have an “autoland” capability.
13.	Must have the ability to return to its take-off point in case of communication loss.
14.	Must be of modular construction with easily replaceable parts.
15.	Must have pre-programmable GPS waypoint navigation capability.
16.	Must have interchangeable pesticide-dispersing mechanisms for the application of ultra-low-volume (ULV) spray and granular pesticides.

Vendors meeting all criteria, or tied with the most criteria met, will proceed on to the second phase.  If only one vendor meets all the criteria after the first phase, award will be made to that vendor.  If a second phase is required, the following criteria (shown with associated number from the list above), listed in order of importance, will be evaluated and points assigned accordingly:

·	Pesticide-dispersing capability (#16, 17, 18, 19)
