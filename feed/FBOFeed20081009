<DESC><p>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) intends to invite bids to restore and modify the runway, provide arrestor gears, and provide stand-by power for the airfield lighting system at Lielvarde Airfield, Latvia.</p>
<p>NAMSA is serving as the NATO contracting agency for these projects, which are being funded within the framework of the Infrastructure Committee.</p>
<p>The NAMSA references for these projects are "2AF33001 Restoration of Runways" "2AF33002 Provision of Arrestor Gears" and 2AF33005 "Minor Work: Stand-by Power for Airfield Lighting System". The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-NAMSA-LATVIA-AIRFIELD.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this procurement, it must first be approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The U.S. Department of Commerce is authorized to approve for participation in NATO ICB those firms with a facility located within the United States. Please visit the following website for a copy of the NATO ICB application:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
</span></p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. Please note, however, that a firm that has been approved for participation in NATO ICB must request a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. A DOE is used to nominate a firm to the bidders list for a particular project.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: NOTICE OF INTENTIncorporation of the Health and Human Services Scope of WorkInto the Savannah River SiteManagement and Operation ContractU. S. Department of EnergySavannah River Operations OfficeOffice of Acquisition ManagementP.O. Box A, Aiken SC, 29802-0900The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Operations Office (SR)Office of Acquisition Management intends to non-competitively incorporateHealth and Human Services work into its recently awarded Management andOperating (M&O) contract with Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (SRNS).In2006, the Health and Human Services support function, historicallyperformed bythe M&O contractor, was excluded from the Departments M&O contractsolicitation in support of a DOE Complex-wide effort to increase the numberofprime contracts awarded to small businesses.  DOEs intent was to awardthisscope of work to a small business.  The action represents a continuingservicerequirement for the entire aggregate performance term of the M&O contractwithSRNS, which has a base period of five (5) years and includes an option toextend the contract for up to five (5) additional years.Description of the service:Health and Human Services, which includes medical services, injury/illnessrecordkeeping and monitoring, and health physics instruments calibrationanddistribution.The statutory sole-source authority to non-competitively incorporate theHealthand Human Services scope of work listed above is 41 U.S.C.  253(c)(1);onlyone responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy theAgencys requirements.The Health and Human Services scope of work is presently being performed bytheformer SRS M&O contractor, Washington Savannah River Company, LLC, (WSRC),under a contract extension to provide liquid waste cleanup operations untiltheaward of the new SRS Liquid Waste contract.  The WSRC contract expires inMarch2009.WSRC, SRNS and three other contractors who perform work at SRS are sponsorsofa Multiple Employer Pension Plan (SRS MEPP), which is a tax-qualifieddefined-benefit pension plan. The SRS MEPP has approximately 8,000 activeparticipants.  The active participants in the SRS MEPP include all of thecurrent WSRC employees and SRNS employees who are considered to beincumbentemployees under the terms of the SRNS M&O contract.DOE practice is for incumbent employees of DOE contractors who participateincontractor-sponsored defined benefit pension plans at a given DOE site tobeable to continue to participate in those plans if they are hired by asuccessorDOE contractor at that site, subject to applicable contract and benefitplanterms and conditions and legal requirements.  In this regard, new DOEcontractors at a given site are required to sponsor an entire existingdefinedbenefit pension plan or a new segment of an existing defined benefitpensionplan.  This is so that incumbent employees hired by the new employer areableto continue to participate in their existing defined benefit pension plansinaccordance with the terms of those plans.  Any new Health and HumanServicescontractor would have to become a sponsor of the SRS MEPP so that WSRCemployees hired by the Health and Human Services contractor could continuetoparticipate in the SRS MEPP.To become a sponsor of a MEPP, any individual employer must meet rigorousInternal Revenue Service (IRS) testing requirements on an individualemployerbasis.  This is because if only one employer/contractor sponsoring asegment ofthe MEPP cannot meet the IRS testing requirements, the entire MEPP will bedisqualified.  If a MEPP is disqualified, all of the employer sponsors maylosethe tax-deductibility of their contributions and, in addition, certain planearnings may become taxable income for all of the plan participants.The IRS rules regarding minimum participation for a segment of a MEPP aresetforth at 26 U.S.C.  401(a)(26).  These rules require that a segment of aMEPPmust benefit at least the lesser of 50 employees of the employer, or thegreater of 40 percent of all employees of the employer, or two employees(or ifthere is only one employee, such employee).  Less than 50 WSRC employeescurrently perform the work encompassed by the Health and Human Servicesworkscope.   Based on these facts, DOE is not aware of any responsible source,other than the M&O contractor, that could satisfy the IRS minimumparticipation requirements for a stand-alone Health and Human Servicessegmentof the SRS MEPP.  DOE, therefore, intends to execute a bilateralmodificationwith SRNS that incorporates the Health and Human Services scope of workintothe M&O contract.There are no solicitation documents available for these requirements.Interested responsible sources may submit information regarding theircapability to perform the Health and Human Services scope of work and itscapability to sponsor a new qualified segment of the SRS MEPP.  Suchinformation shall be considered by the Department for the purpose ofdetermining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition.  Anyresponding party must provide a capability statement to demonstrate thefollowing information:  (1) that the responding party can sponsor atax-qualified segment of the SRS MEPP that includes the WSRC employees whopresently perform the Health and Human Services work scope.  Thisinformationmust include a detailed analysis with necessary supporting data thatdemonstrates the responding party will be able to sponsor a tax-qualifiedsegment of the SRS MEPP that adheres to all relevant IRS regulations for aMEPP, including but not limited to minimum participation requirements setforthat 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(26); and (2) that the responding party has the abilitytosuccessfully perform the Health and Human Services function describedabove.Responses to this synopsis must be received via the Departments IndustryInteractive Procurement System by October 24, 2008.Contracting Office Address:P.O.

Department of EnergySavannah River Operations OfficeOffice of Acquisition ManagementP.O. Box A, Aiken SC, 29802-0900The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Operations Office (SR)Office of Acquisition Management intends to non-competitively incorporateInformation Technology and Management Services work into its recentlyawardedManagement and Operating (M&O) contract with Savannah River NuclearSolutions,LLC (SRNS).

This is because if only one employer/contractor sponsoring asegment ofthe MEPP cannot meet the IRS testing requirements, the entire MEPP will bedisqualified.  If a MEPP is disqualified, all of the employer sponsors maylosethe tax-deductibility of their contributions and, in addition, certain planearnings may become taxable income for all of the plan participants.In 2007, a small business contractor was identified to perform theInformationTechnology and Management Services scope of work.  In order to ensure thattheprospective small business Information Technology and Management Servicescontractor could sponsor a new qualified segment of the SRS MEPP, DOE andthecontractor performed extensive legal and actuarial analyses to determinewhether the contractor could meet IRS coverage testing requirements setforthat 26 U.S.C.  410(b).  Qualified pension plans can satisfy one of twoalternative coverage tests under IRS regulations: a coverage test on anemployer-wide basis test, or coverage testing on a Qualified Separate LineofBusiness basis (QSLOB).  These IRS coverage tests are administered topreventemployers from providing better retirement benefits to its highlycompensatedemployees than to its non-highly compensated employees, as those terms aredefined in IRS regulations. The actuarial and legal analyses showed thattheprospective small business Information Technology and Management Servicescontractor could not pass coverage testing on either basis.  Based on thesefacts, DOE is not aware of any responsible source, other than the M&Ocontractor, that could satisfy the coverage testing requirements for astand-alone Information Technology and Management Services segment of theSRSMEPP.  DOE, therefore, intends to execute a bilateral modification withSRNSthat incorporates the Information Technology and Management Services scopeofwork into the M&O contract.There are no solicitation documents available for these requirements.Interested responsible sources may submit information regarding itscapabilityto perform the Information Technology and Management Services scope of workandits capability to sponsor a new qualified segment of the SRS MEPP.

<DESC>The FDA intents to issue and RFP to provide Population-based data to answer questions of public health importance regarding biological products. The threat of a swine influenza pandemic in 1976-77 led to a mass vaccination effort in the United States. Unfortunately, the vaccine was subsequently found to cause rare cases of Guillain Barr Syndrome (GBS), a severe paralyzing neurologic condition. For any future large-scale influenza immunization campaign, it is important that the government be well prepared to detect a problem that occurred once before, and the public would expect no less. Although clinical pre-licensure studies may identify potential adverse events associated with a biologic product, rare adverse events associated with the biologic product will likely go unrecognized until there is widespread use of the biologic product in the population. The timely identification of serious rare adverse events is important for at least three reasons. First, the morbidity to the individual may be severe, representing an important safety issue. Second, unwarranted fear of adverse reactions can lead to a lack of confidence in, and inappropriately low use of, the biologic product such as a vaccine. Third, new and timely information that quantifies the incidence of serious vaccine adverse effects, if any, can facilitate benefit-risk analysis of continued use of the biologic product. The objective of this requirement is to development of large rapid systems for monitoring adverse events associated with a biologic product is important, and increasing this capacity currently for existing biologic products can help prepare for a biologic threat such as influenza pandemic that would require mass immunizations. This project would further enhance the ability of FDA to conduct biologic safety and effectiveness among large diverse populations, with respect to severe but uncommon adverse events. This requirements goal is to gain access to data resources that promote the Division Epidemiologys mission to assure the safety and effectiveness of biologic products. This project builds upon and expands on activities undertaken as part of previous FDA collaborative studies for biologic product safety, including evaluating adverse events after influenza vaccination among the elderly using Medicare data. During the course of the contract period of performance, the Contractor shall provide a work plan(s) and a cost estimate(s) for each specific biologic safety study requested. The Contractor will be required to:1) Analytic datasets and associated documentation (per terms of contract). 
2) Medical record review and abstraction (necessity to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Note-not to be delivered to FDA directly). 
3) Physician and/or Patient Survey (necessity to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis). 
4) Work closely with FDA to develop feasibility studies (frequencies to be determined by FDAs identification of a biologic safety and/or effectiveness issue). 
5) Work closely with FDA in the development of a detailed protocol for a formal pharmacoepidemiolgic study.
The contract performance will be in the Washington DC/Maryland area. An indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract is anticipated, for five(5)years. This is a new requirement.
FDA intends to solicit this requirement as Full and Open competitive requirement. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). FDA anticipates release of the RFP on or around August 1, 2008 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before September 20, 2008.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Panama City Division, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida 32407-7001 intends to solicit EchoStorm Worldwide, LLC, 7007 Harbour View Boulevard, Suite 101, Sufflok, VA 23435-2719 on a sole source basis for one (1) Single-Feed adLib video & Sensor Management System and installation support.  The initial Technology Insertion into the Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) spiral 1.2 of Increment I includes the delivery of a video archival system that's capable of integrating varied sensor data.  The archival of data needs to support the DJC2 content search and discovery requirements of the program without tight software integration.  This enables DJC2's portal and net-centric data strategy to co-exist and leverage current DJC2 software services.  Further, the myriad of sensor data that DJC2 handles due to its requirement to support Geographic Combatant Commanders in varied mission requirements implies that a system must handle all ephemeris encoding methodologies in use in the field. This is the only known system that handles the ephemeris data in an open method and allows that data to be tagged within DJC2's net-centric data strategy.  Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated.  NAICS Code 541511 applies.  Size Standard is $23M.  FSC is 7030.  Contract Specialist: Vivian Truman, Code XPS1, NSWC Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:Diana.W.Frimmel@nasa.gov">Diana W. Frimmel</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for FOR ADUAL-POLARIZED ANTENNA SYSTEM.	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Goddard Space Flight Center, Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia hasrequirements for an integrated S-band (2700-2900 MHz) dual-polarized antenna system. Theantenna system shall consist of a parabolic reflector, dual-polarized feed horn,pedestal, drive motors, and servo-amplifiers. The system shall be capable of emitting andreceiving both horizontal and vertical linearly polarized RF energy.  The antenna system will be used as an integrated component of a transportablemeteorological research radar, and all of the components, with the possible exception of the pedestal, shall be constructed so that they may be shipped in standard ISO seatainerswith outside dimensions of either 2.44 m x 2.44 m x 6.1m (8 x 8 x 20) or 2.44 m x 2.44m x 12.2m (8 x 8 x 40). The primary objective of the radar system is to collectmeteorological research quality reflectivity, Doppler and polarimetric data at variousremote locations in the world. The antenna system shall have a 1 degree beamwidth and becapable of handling up to 1.0 megawatts peak pulsed power with pulse widths up to 2microseconds and pulse recurrence frequencies up to 1200 pulses per second. The antennawill be scanned in the azimuth and elevation planes; it will not be used for closed looptracking. The antenna-pedestal system will be designed to operate without a radome underwinds up to 60 mph sustained and survive 120 mph gusts, with acceleration up to 20degrees per second per second and under environmental conditions from  a 1 inch radialicing loads to tropical heats as specified in this document. A high performance antenna is required for accurate measurements of dual-polarimetricquantities. The electrical specifications of the feed/OMT, reflector surface accuracy andsecondary patterns are hence stringent as specified in this document. For example, thefirst side lobe must be at least 28 dB lower than the on axis value and the on axis crosspolarization ratio less than -38dB.

<DESC>This notice is issued by NASA/GFSC to post a Request for Information (RFI) for workto be performed at NASA Independent Verification and Validation Facility in Fairmont,West Virginia via internet and solicit responses from interested parties in regard tovendor capability and interest.   NASA is seeking capability statements from both large and small businesses to aid in theacquisition planning for this requirement. Small Businesses interested in thisopportunity may decide to partner in a joint venture with other small and/or largebusinesses in order to meet the IV&V requirements in this future acquisition.  SECTION 1  BACKGROUND1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATIONThe NASA IV&V Facility strives to improve software safety, reliability, and quality ofNASA programs and missions through effective applications of systems and software IV&Vmethods, practices, and techniques. The NASA IV&V Facility applies software engineeringbest practices to evaluate the correctness and quality of critical and complex softwaresystems throughout the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC).Verification is the process of determining whether or not the software products of agiven phase of the SDLC fulfill the established requirements for that phase. Verificationanswers the question, "Are we building the product right?"Validation evaluates the software products throughout the SDLC to ensure those productsmeet the mission and customer's needs. Validation answers the question, "Are we buildingthe right product?"When applying systems and software IV&V, the NASA IV&V Facility seeks to answer thefollowing questions:    1. What is the system software supposed to do?    2. What is the system software not supposed to do?    3. How does the system software respond under adverse conditions?The NASA IV&V Facility's analytical approaches enable efficient, cost effective IV&Vservice through the usage of broad-based expertise, adaptive software engineering bestpractices, and tools that are in place at the NASA IV&V Facility. The analytical paradigmutilized by the NASA IV&V Facility requires a multi-disciplinary team, and a qualitativesoftware risk and criticality assessment capability coupled with an extensive multiphase,phase-independent IV&V analytical processes.IV&V has been demonstrated to be an effective technique on large, complex softwaresystems to increase the probability of software being delivered that meets requirementsand is safe, within cost, and on schedule. When performed in parallel with the SDLC, IV&Vprovides for the early detection and identification of risk elements. The NASA IV&VFacility is then able to provide this information to the development organization,allowing them to take action to mitigate these risks early in the SDLC.The scope of work under consideration for purposes of this RFI includes the performanceof IV&V on selected software systems being developed by or for NASA and other Federal,State and local government agencies.  The current contracts providing these services arethe GSFC Contracts NNG05CB16C and NNG05CB17C, which expire May 2010.1.2 PURPOSE OF RFIThis notice is issued by NASA to post a Request for Information (RFI) for the NASAIndependent Verification and Validation Facility in Fairmont, West Virginia and solicitresponses from interested parties in regard to vendor capability and interest.

<DESC>A MARKET SURVEY is being conducted to determine if there is a reasonable number of interested small business concerns to set this future project aside for them.  If your firm is a certified HUBZone, 8A, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Busines and you are interested in this project please respond appropriately.The proposed project is a DESIGN BUILD Medical Dental Facility at Ft. Campbell, KY. The estimated cost range is more than $10,000,000.00. NAICS is 236220. The following is a description of the project. The overarching objective is to design and construct facilities for the military that are consistent with the design and construction practices used for civilian sector projects that perform similar functions to the military projects.  The military facility types to be constructed as part of this project include Medical Facility and Dental Facility, which correspond to civilian facility types of the same name. This project type will house outpatient medical and dental treatment functions. It is intended to be similar to medical clinics and dental clinics in the private sector community.  The Medical/Dental Clinic will provide medical and dental treatment facilities to support U.S. Army Modular Force restructuring actions at Fort Campbell. The Clinic will serve Active Duty Soldiers only. The GSF as indicated in the PFD shall be 43,176 GSF maximum (29,444 GSF Medical Clinic + 13,732 GSF Dental Clinic). Required parking spaces for the Medical/Dental Clinic D-B RFP are calculated in accordance with UFC 4-510-01 Table 1-1.  Currently, this calculation yields a requirement for 215 parking spaces. It is the Armys objective that these buildings will have a 25-year useful design life before a possible re-use/re-purpose or renovation requirement, to include normal sustainment, restoration, modernization activities and a 50-year building replacement life. Therefore, the design and construction should provide an appropriate level of quality to ensure the continued use of the facility over that time period with the application of reasonable preventive maintenance and repairs that would be industry-acceptable to a major civilian sector project OWNER. Modular construction is not acceptable. The site infrastructure will have at least a 50-year life expectancy with industry-accepted preventive maintenance and repair cycles. The intent of the Government is to emphasize the functional/operational requirements. Materials and methods shall be the most appropriate Type of Construction allowed by code and criteria for this occupancy/project. The design shall develop the project site for efficiency and to convey a sense of unity or connectivity with the adjacent buildings and with the Installation as a whole.  Provide all site improvements necessary to support the new building facilities. The D-B Contractor shall meet the requirements to be provided in the RFP and use his engineering judgment to develop a site plan for this Medical/Dental Clinic site.<BR>It is the stated desire of the Government that this Medical/Dental Clinic project shall comply with principals and requirements to achieve Silver Level of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating. Solutions that conserve energy, improve workplace habitability and can be justified by life cycle cost analysis as cost effective are encouraged. Public Law 102-486, Executive Order 12423, and Federal Regulations 10 CFR 433 requires government to design and construct facilities in an energy-conserving manner while considering life cycle cost over the life of the facilities. The CFR requires that the design meet ASHRAE Standard 90.1  2004 and, to the extent of life cycle cost effectiveness, achieve energy consumption levels that are at least 30% below the levels of the baseline building using the method found in Appendix G of ASHRAE Standard 90.1  2004. Sustainability shall be a consideration throughout the process of project development from inception. Logistical Responsibility for Building Systems shall be as indicated in UFC 4-510-01 Design: Medical Military Facilities (May 2007) Section 1, FIGURE 1-2.<BR>Logistical Responsibility for Medical Equipment shall be as indicated in Section 15: Medical and Dental Equipment of UFC 4-510-01 Design: Medical Military Facilities (May 2007). Demolition in the scope of this project includes removal, to a depth of 5 feet, of anything encountered that interferes with installation of the building substructure. All interested certified HUBZone, 8A, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business contractors should respond to this survey no later than 23 October 2008, 4:30 local time. If your response is ten pages or less you may email it to debra.c.bruner@usace.army.mil.  Fax responses are to be sent to 502-315-6195. Responses should include: (1) Identificaton and verification of the company's small business status. (2) The level of performance and payment bonding capacity the company could attain for the proposed project. (3) Descriptions of Experience of projects that are substantially complete or completed within the last five years which are similar to this project in size, scope, AND dollar value. Projects considerd similar in scope include medical and or dental faciities, outpatient clinics, or medical service buildings. Provide if these facilities were on a military installation.  Provide the date the project was completed or will be complete, the amount of the project your company completed and the square footage of the project, and if it was a design build project. (4) A statement of the portion of the work that will be self performed on this project, and how it will be accomplished.  Please only include a narrative of the required information; additional information will not be reviewed. If you have questions, call Debra Bruner at 502-315-6208 or email debra.c.bruner@usace.army.mil.  This is NOT a request for proposal.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Business Models for Autism Services RFI<BR>Agency: Department of Defense (DoD)<BR>Office: TRICARE Management Activity (TMA)<BR>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any service. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in responding to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely the respondent party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP if one is issued. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change without notice and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned.  Information provided by respondents may be subject to the Freedom of Information Act, unless the information is marked Proprietary, Do Not Release  Responses to this RFI should discuss, in narrative form, the aspects of potential business models that address the needs described below.<BR><BR>PURPOSE<BR>Department of Defense (DoD) has developed this RFI to gain industry insight to accomplish the following:<BR><BR>"	Evaluate the feasibility and appropriateness of instituting demonstrations of viable Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) intervention business models within or in geographic proximity of military installations<BR>"	Make needed educational services accessible to military dependent children with ASD.  <BR><BR>The term business model refers to the financial and contractual relationship between the DoD and the service providers in the implementation of managed care services.  The desired outcome of this RFI is to identify potential solutions that may enable the DoD to realize the goal of this initiative.<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION<BR>The Military Health System (MHS) is a $33 billion dollar enterprise, consisting of 76 military hospitals, over 500 military health clinics, and an extensive network of private sector health care partners, providing medical care for over 9 million beneficiaries.  An estimated 9,00011,000 children carry one of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses among the more than 1.2 million children of Active Duty Military personnel.<BR><BR>Under Section 587 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, DoD is authorized to conduct demonstrations designed to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of educational services delivered under TRICARE to military-dependent children with ASD.  One goal of Section 587 is to improve availability of and access to evidence-based treatment for ASD.  Achieving this goal requires encouraging the greater concentration and availability of quality providers in the geographic areas in which military dependent children with ASD are located and enhancing the ability of service members to procure those provided services.<BR><BR>Currently, TRICARE enters into cost sharing agreements to provide certain autism services to children with ASD.  A scarcity of certified professionals in this specialty makes accessing these services difficult.  TMA is interested in learning about potential business models of care delivery that might be applicable in serving the needs of military dependent children with ASD.<BR><BR>QUESTION<BR>Please describe either existing or potential business model(s) that would make effective, professionally managed, cost-efficient, applied behavior analysis-based educational services readily available to military dependent children in the Continental US.  The services indicated here must be evidence-based and have been studied sufficiently in the peer-reviewed literature to have been proven effective in improving the core deficits of ASD permitting greater engagement in and success in educational settings for affected children.  The services provided as a result of implementing the model should be available either within military installations or in close proximity of installations.  Respondents should comment on how the described model(s) would serve populations of military dependent children with ASD that vary greatly in number from installation to installation (e.g., several hundred children in Portsmouth, VA to tens of children at many of the other installations throughout the US) and who are located in geographic areas with markedly differing availability of supporting medical, educational and supplemental services.<BR><BR>Please ensure the following are included in your response:<BR>"	Description of the number and types of providers required by the model<BR>"	If the model described uses paraprofessionals to provide one-on-one or group  services to children, how would it provide oversight of the paraprofessionals to ensure they meet professional standards, as stated in the DoD Enhancing Access to Autism Services demonstration project (see TRICARE Operations Manual, Chapter 20, Section 10.5.3, available at http://manuals.tricare.osd.mil), in delivering those services.<BR>"	How the model uses State, local and community educational and other DoD resources to provide cost-efficient services<BR>"	How the model would ensure access to services for military dependents<BR>"	The advantages and disadvantages of the model as opposed to standard models of service delivery available in the community<BR>"	The cost elements inherent to the model and how those elements are more or less costly than similar elements as they are utilized in standard models of service delivery available in the community<BR>"	Identify realized and/or potential risks (health, educational, financial) risks associated with the proposed business model(s) and describe how those risks have been or would be managed and/or mitigated <BR><BR><BR>SUBMISSION DIRECTIONS<BR>1.	Written responses should be directed to Barry Sayer, Contracting Officer by e-mail at barry.sayer@us.army.mil no later 12:00pm (noon) EST on October 24, 2008.<BR>2.	Develop an RFI response that does not exceed four single sided pages per business model described.  It is requested that the response focus on the identified strategic questions and that corporate information be limited to not more than one page. <BR>3.	The Government does not desire to receive individual corporate marketing materials or slick sheets and will not review them. <BR>4.	Please direct any questions or comments to the Contracting Officer at the e-mail address above.   All questions must be in writing via e-mail and submitted no later than October 17, 2008.   Please provide the name, address, and telephone number of your company and the individual requestor's name in the e-mail.  No telephonic questions will be accepted. <BR>5.

This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information.   This RFI will assist in programmatic decisions regarding options to address the need for offshore patrol vessel capability, and the replacement of the current legacy WMEC (Medium Endurance Cutter) fleet with manageable developmental and programmatic risk.     This RFI seeks  offshore patrol vessel design particulars and operational features on proven vessels as well as mature mission related technologies that are currently in operation and have the potential to meet USCG requirements. Furthermore, these vessels and/or technologies shall be capable of meeting the USCG requirements without significant development (e.g. as a parent craft design or as a variant of the parent craft in the case of vessels).  Information on vessels submitted must be based on: 1) proven, currently in service vessels that are capable of being built in the United States (US); 2) In service vessel designs that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; or, 3) Variants of in service vessel designs capable of being licensed in the US.  New vessel designs and unproven vessels (not in service or not a variant of in service) designs are not of interest in this request and will not be reviewed. Information submitted on mission related technologies must be based on: 1) mature (TRL7 or higher) technologies 2) intended for use on offshore patrol type vessels similar in mission to the OPC.     

It is expected that the OPC missions will generally operate in deep water (beyond 50 nautical miles from shore) in extreme environmental conditions in a low threat environment. The geographic area of operation may include anywhere in the world that the Coast Guard or United States has interest (this may or may not include polar ice covered areas so designs with and without ice capability are of interest). Missions may typically entail ports and waterways security, search and rescue, drug interdiction, migrant interdiction, Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) enforcement, defense of escorted vessels and command presence in areas of distress.  The vessel will generally operate for 185-210 days away from homeport. Patrols are 45-60 days in duration with inport logistics breaks approximately 2-3 days for every 14 days underway.

To better define the design characteristics and operational features the USCG expects in an acceptable proven OPV  design submittal to this RFI, a set of preliminary notional top level operational requirements are identified in section I of the attachment. Recognizing that proven designs may not meet all the requirements listed in section I of the attachment; that the USCG has not yet finalized its operational requirements; and that proven designs could possibly be modified to meet the requirements of section 1 of the attachment, proven designs within or near the range of characteristics identified in section II of the attachment are welcome and may be submitted for consideration. 

The vessel and/or technology information requested is intended to include, but not be limited to, engineering and operational design details,  developmental history, operational history, user contacts and other information that would be helpful for making programmatic decisions. Specifically, the requested minimum and desired information is listed in section III of the attachment.  Any restrictive markings included on the data listed below shall be adhered to by the USCG. In responding to this request, data and information (drawings, documents, tables, graphs, etc.) may be submitted in different formats and media (paper or electronic files).     

The USCG will generally treat all information received on a need-to-know basis, however responders should specifically mark or identify any information they perceive is proprietary/confidential for which they seek added confidentiality. All proprietary or classified information submitted with this RFI will be treated as business sensitive or to the extent specified by the provider.  All proprietary or classified information received will be destroyed by the USCG within twelve months of receipt unless the provider requests that it be returned.  Costs associated with returning information shall be incurred by the provider of such information.  Submitters are advised that Government support contractors will be involved with the review of submitted information in addition to the USCG. Each submitter that has responded to this RFI will be notified of the identity of the support contractor before their information is provided to the support contractor for review. All Government support contractors required to review the information will be required to submit non-disclosure or confidentiality statements. 

Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.  The USCG understands that any pricing information submitted under this RFI is an estimate only and is not binding nor constitutes a proposal.  Responses to this RFI can be submitted to Mr. Carl McGill (CG-9125) via email (carl.e.mcgill@uscg.mil) or hard copy mail by 2:00 p.m. on November 10, 2008.  Responses received after November 10, 2008 may not be afforded a comprehensive review. Responses shall include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
This solicitation is being issued pursuant to the procedures at FAR 13.  Synopsis exception FAR 5.202(a)(13) applies and Solicitation Number N00164-08-P-0751 http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm is hereby issued as an attachment hereto.  
The government intends to modify the existing purchase order, no solicitation will be issued.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Applied Research Associates Inc, 4300 San Mateo Blvd., NE Suite A220, Albuquerque, NM 87110-1295.  This announcement is for the purpose of complying with far 5.201.  
This is a planned sole source procurement action to the existing purchase order, due to unforeseen delays encountered in the testing schedule.  The government is required to modify the existing purchase order to cover all of the associated costs to complete the scope of their mission.  NSWC Crane and Applied Research Associates Inc., are required to test more test samples than originally scheduled, because the government currently cannot get the desired test samples to the test site within the timeframe needed for the correlation test.  This delay will cause Applied Research Associates Inc., to store the ordnance material and other supplies and equipment until the additional test samples are made available.  This modification to increase this purchase order will provide the necessary funds to successfully complete the correlation testing.
All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to Crane web site, FedBizOpps and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and/or NECO for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation.  For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.  Offers may be faxed to Sharon LaPray, FAX 812-854-3465 or e-mailed to sharon.lapray@navy.mil.  All required information must be received on or before 3:00 PM EDT.

Designs will be developed using BIM.  BIM must be compliant with the latest version of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as established by the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI).  The existing hospital will remain operational during construction.  <BR><BR>The design will include Evidence Based Design, fire protection and alarm systems coordinated with the Mass Notification system.  Coordination with the installation physical security plan for inclusion of all physical security measures and all required antiterrorism protection measures will be required.  <BR><BR>Sustainable principles will be integrated into the design with a minimum LEED Silver Certification goal and development and construction of the project in accordance with Executive Order 13123.  LEED NC-2.2 Energy Cost Calculations, EPAct 2005, and other applicable laws and Executive Orders will be applied to the design.  Project will be designed in accordance with: Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-510-01 (formally Military Handbook 1191), Design: Medical Military Facilities; NFPA 101; NFPA 99; Americans with Disabilities Act/Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADA/ABAAG); UFC 4-010-01, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings. The design will be prepared using the English system of measurement. Construction cost estimates will be prepared using Corps of Engineers' Computer Aided Cost Estimating System MII (MCACES 2nd Generation).  Software will be provided by the Government.  BIM software will be utilized during the design phase and will also be developed for use by the General Contractor and subcontractors during construction in order to ensure functionality of all spaces, constructability, operability, and maintainability.  Source files used to develop construction documents must be provided.  All submittals should have the drawing set submitted in text searchable PDFs and the current electronic source files.

The Medical Equipment Planner should be experienced in the use of the Military Standard 1691 with the ability of successfully applying the UFC 4-510-01.  The A-E will produce 100% equipment drawings and specifications.<BR><BR>The Kansas City District intends to utilize ECI for the acquisition of the construction portion of this project.  The use of ECI requires collaboration between the designers, customers, and the ECI construction contractor during the design phase of the project.  Collaboration between the designers and the ECI construction contractor allows for the incorporation of key comments from the Government, user, certifying agencies and construction contractor in finalizing the design product. To optimize collaboration, the A-E shall provide space for two (2) ECI contractor employees and two (2) Government employees within the A-Es office for the duration of the design. The ECI contractor employees will be providing constructability and pricing input to the design team.  The Government will provide a design liaison as well as design expertise from the Kansas City District.  Available disciplines with facility design experience (no healthcare design experience) include architecture, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, structural engineering, and interior design.  The Government intends for the embedded Government team members to work under the supervision of the A-E firm's lead designer(s).  The embedded Government employees will work directly in the offices of the A-E firm to the maximum extent possible.  The A-E will submit a proposal detailing how they plan to integrate the Government designers into their design team.  See factor G below.  The Government will provide resumes in accordance with the positions identified above upon request of the offeror.  This requirement will be further defined in the scope of work and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) will be developed to address liability issues.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this notice is to provide Fair Opportunity to industry by advertising that a forth-coming amendment to this RFP will be posted soon. The amendment will be made in a manner that is consistent with the intent, principle, and substance of FAR 15.206(e), which normally entails a cancellation and re-solicitation due to a change so substantial as to exceed what prospective offerors reasonably could have anticipated from the original solicitation. This synopsis, in conjunction with the amendment to be posted, hereby solicits new, additional offerors that are not already participating in the source selection that would otherwise have provided proposals if this change had been part of the initial RFP. The change is a partial de-scope of the operations (pilot and controller services) portion of this requirement. The Government intends to de-scope the Period of Performance for Operations from a 6 month base period and 6 optional years to a 6 month base period and 1 option year. This de-scope affects CLINs X001 through X006. There will also be some minor changes made to the CLIN structure to better streamline the RFP as well as minor changes to the PWS that are not related to de-scoping the Operations services. If this pending change impacts your decision to participate in this source selection and you are interested in providing a proposal, please notify Mr. Augustine P. Salvati in writing at augustine.salvati@langley.af.mil NLT 1600 on 17 Oct 08.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to add an additional topic area as follows.
<p>White papers are being sought to enhance Space Situational Awareness by providing automated knowledge tools and decision aids that utilize state-of-the-art multi-sensor exploitation techniques for the purpose of improving characterization performance and reducing operational analyst workload. Technologies leading to the rapid improvement of capabilities for spectral and signals signature characterization of resident space objects and determination of adversarial intent are needed. These tools should provide new capabilities for more effective exploitation of complementary multi-source sensor and intelligence data for improved Space Situational Awareness. Development of tools and techniques that equip the operational analyst to provide timely and highly accurate signature characterization of RSOs leading to threat analysis is increasingly critical to addressing multiple Space Domain issues. The focus of these technologies is to provide direct assistance to DoD and Intelligence Community partners.</p>
<p>Recommended date for white papers on this topic area is 10 November 2008.</p>
<p>DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer. All white papers must be addressed to ATTN: Bernie Clarke, Reference BAA 05-09-IFKA, AFRL/RIEC, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.

The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (Tech Center) has a continuing requirement for services that were previously procured on a single contract, DTFACT-04-C-00014, awarded to All Star Services, Inc.  This contract expires on September 30, 2009.  One of the FAA's fundamental procurement principles is to provide attainable and reasonable opportunities for small businesses.  This announcement seeks to survey and assess the current marketplace for small businesses that are capable of performing any one of the eight major trade area services listed in Table 1, attached.  
This market survey will aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside any of the requirements, listed on Table 1, for small business when the RFO follows. Responses to this announcement will be used to determine competition level and whether sufficient competition exists to set aside any of the eight major trade requirements for small business, for small, economically-disadvantaged (SEDB) firms; Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) of for very small businesses.  
Background:  Work to be done at the Tech Center covers 5000 acres, includes approximately 125 buildings, utility distribution systems, motor vehicles, and roads and grounds.  The Center contracts out nearly all its facility operations and maintenance work to private contractors, except for a small amount of work done by the Center's in-house shops.  
The current contract is a hybrid contract of fixed price work (namely operation and maintenance of the central utility plant and water treatment plant, scheduled preventive maintenance and servicing of installed equipment--approximately 15,000 items), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) time and materials and cost-plus fixed fee (such as for emergency repair of storm damage, or trash and hazardous waste removal and disposal).  Included in separate contracts and not part of this market survey are custodial/janitorial services, security guards and cafeteria operations.
The Center's COMS contract includes servicing of some of the tenant-owned facilities located on the campus.  Servicing of facilities owned and paid for by others is distinguished from Center facilities, and financed by the tenants.  Full servicing is currently provided for the FAA's Eastern Region Air Traffic Control Tower, Transportation Security laboratories and the Federal Air Marshall's training and administrative facilities; selective servicing is performed for the US Coast Guard and NJ Air National Guard.
The complete announcement is attached.Also attached are the Business Declaration Form and Table 1.

<DESC><p>RESPONSES ARE DUE BY 4 PM, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2008.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI)&nbsp;Chemical Biology Consortium&nbsp;(CBC) is being developed to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat patients with cancer. The NCI seeks to coordinate academic and private drug discovery efforts with its own, and thereby expedite the entry of new molecular entities (NME) into oncologic practice. The program is being developed by NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), in conjunction with NCI's Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the NCI Director's Office, with guidance from external advisory panels. This effort will be managed by the NCI's Experimental Therapeutics (NExT) Program. SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) is responsible for providing support for the key operational and technical aspects. It is envisioned that this Consortium will provide cutting-edge chemical tools for probing complex biochemical signaling pathways and will serve as the starting point for the elaboration of first-in-class targeted therapies. The long-term vision of the CBC is to bridge the gap between basic scientific findings and NCI-supported clinical research to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat patients with cancer.</p>
<p>The CBC will establish an integrated network of chemical biologists, molecular oncologists, and compound screening centers from government, academia, and eventually from industry. The drug discovery strategy of the CBC is to expand current NCI programs by providing a coordinated focus on therapeutic opportunities in high-risk, under-represented areas, significantly advancing the discovery of novel compounds active against specific molecular and genetic cancer targets. CBC efforts will include recruiting extramural investigators with specialized expertise in novel discovery platforms as well as medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, molecular oncology, and other areas of drug discovery and development. The CBC will be centrally managed to coordinate the selection of targets and screening for agents that interact with these targets, and will then use an iterative development process to design and optimize drug "hits" into "leads." The CBC will benefit from access to the NCI's late-stage drug development resources and expertise.</p>
<p>SAIC-F is seeking technical proposals for Comprehensive Chemical Biology Screening Centers, Chemical Diversity Centers and/or Specialized Applications Centers. Participants are expected to support the progression of candidate molecules through formal milestones/Stage Gate discovery and development criteria established by Chemical Biology Consortium (CBC) leadership in accordance with industry standards.</p>
<p>Participants will have an unparalleled opportunity to participate in a highly collaborative drug discovery partnership with the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Using state-of-the-art communication, data-sharing and project management tools, the CBC will effect a paradigm shift in the use of public-private partnerships to translate knowledge from leading academic institutions into ground-breaking new drug candidates for patients with cancer.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking a contractor to provide a resource of preclinical and non-clinical services to advance the development of Topical microbicides (TM) and biomedical prevention (BP).  There is a critical need to promote discovery and transition of new strategies into clinical trials.  This NIAID-sponsored contract focuses on promoting the development of strategies containing TM/BP as a means to address the NIAID and Division of AIDS (DAIDS) priority of controlling and preventing the HIV/AIDS epidemic worldwide.  This contract will provide pre-clinical and non-clinical development services of TM/BP products essential for advancement to clinical testing and for supporting activities required for IND and NDE applications to the FDA.  TM/BP products for development services will be provided by or through the Project Officer and will be identified through NIAID-funded grants and contracts, the private sector, or other sources.  The specific services required will depend on the status of the individual candidate(s), the need to prioritize potential candidates, and an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA.  The scope of pre-clinical and non-clinical services to be provided include: (1) Individual gap-filling services on a case-by-case basis, to advance TM/BP products in the development pathway toward clinical assessment; (2) Comprehensive services for selected TM/BP products through a Go/No-Go milestone-driven pathway to accelerate a product toward clinical testing in the most efficient manner; and (3) Support for Best Practices Working Groups (BPWGs) composed of non-contract investigators to assess the critical processes and assays used to compare and advance products to clinical studies.  This activity will ultimately lead to identification and validation of surrogate biomarkers for safety and efficacy testing in clinical trials.  The Government anticipates the potential need to exercise options for additional BPWGs during the life of the contract.  It is estimated that up to four options for a total of 4 BPWGs will be exercised at the discretion of the Government during the period of the contract.  These options may be exercised during contract years 2-7.  The NIAID reserves the right to exercise more than one option per year, however, the total number of options will not exceed four during the 7-year period of the contract.  The NAICS code is 541 & 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  This RFP will be available electronically on/about October 17, 2008, and may be accessed through the Federal Business Opportunities at https://www.fbo.gov and the NIAID Office of Acquisition (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.
