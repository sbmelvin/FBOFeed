<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT (SS), ANNOUNCEMENT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), ONLY. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government. The United States Army/Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is not obligated to make award as a result of this request. This is for informational and planning purposes only and does NOT constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB), a Request for Quotation (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP), and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the U.S. Army/REF to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The U.S. Army/REF is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any company of entity that responds to this announcement. Submitting information for this announcement is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated. It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government. However, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. If so, clearly mark all proprietary information as such.
<p>No questions will be taken on the SS/RFI. The information will be used to assist determination of sources capable of countering small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) ahead of an upcoming test. The test event is fixed, therefore no late submissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>Please identify your company's business size, based on the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 336411-Aircraft Manufacturing or possible 611512 Flight Training</p>
<p><br />Background and Scope<br />The threat of UASs on Americans either within or outside of the Continental United States (CONUS) is an ongoing concern. Continued improvements to UAS technology are making the systems more available and at lower cost, with a larger payload ratio (payload weight divided by vehicle weight), and easier to fly, navigate and transport, increasing the opportunities to use the UAS in helpful or nefarious ways. This test event evaluates technologies intended to counter UASs through detection, classification, and defeat. Sources sought should be capable of:</p>
<p>1. Detection of CLI UAS (&lt;20 lbs)<br />2. Identification of CLI UAS<br />3. Non-kinetic defeat of CLI UAS</p>
<p>The primary focus will be on Group 1 UASs, both vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and fixed wing that have a maximum weight of 20 pounds, maximum operating altitude of 1200 feet AGL, maximum speed of 100 knots, and maximum range of 10 nautical miles. They are typically hand-launched, self-contained, portable systems employed for a small unit or base security. They are capable of providing "over-the-hill" or "around-the-corner" reconnaissance and surveillance. They typically operate within visual range and are analogous to radio-controlled model airplanes. Examples of Group 1 UASs are the DJI Phantom and X-UAV Talon.</p>
<p>The REF is seeking to find existing products that can detect, identify, and defeat Group 1 UAS. The method of defeat must be non-kinetic in nature and operation. The standoff of UAS detection must be at least 800 meters. The system of detection and identification must be able to differentiate between multiple UAS, manned aircraft, and natural flora and fauna. <br />The REF will not provide funding for those responding to attend. Attendance at this event is the responsibility of those that are selected to attend. The REF will not publish results of the test to the general public or those that attend. A participant may request the release of their raw testing data, but will not be shown the raw data of other participants.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assist in the selection of available counter UAS products at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) six (6) and greater ahead of an upcoming test event. TRL 6 is defined as representative model or prototype system tested in a relevant environment.</p>
<p>Vendors who are able to attend a test event for the month of June 2016 within the State of Arizona, and are able to perform all of the parameters set forth below, are asked to forward supporting information back to the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF).</p>
<p>Requested Information:<br />The submitted documentation and content becomes the property of the United States Government and will not be returned. The Government will not reimburse costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. Although solicitation terminology may appear in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>This notice is part of Government market research. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company or industry proprietary information contained in responses should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, so that publicly releasable and proprietary information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one source to establish the capability and requirements for any future acquisition, so as to inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>All information should be submitted by email to addresses provided above. If unable to submit via email, please advise CPT Hudson by email and then forward paper copies/material to:</p>
