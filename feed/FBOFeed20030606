<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional grant program support services from Susan M. Sparks, Clearwater, Florida.  The purpose of this procurement is to acquire professional grant program support services for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) in conducting its extramural program grant activities. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide professional support services for NLM in conducting its grant programs, particularly in the areas of Small Business Innovation Research Grants, publication grants, conference grants, certain research contracts and purchase orders.  At the direction of the Project Officers, the Contractor shall accomplish program support tasks for NLM. The following are representative tasks: 1) Publicize the programs to the appropriate communities. Many of the NLM grant programs are of potential use to members of the community who are less likely than are University faculty to be aware of NLM programs. Informing the community about our programs through selective use of print and electronic announcements, and through personal interaction in suitable forums is an important element of a successful grant program. 2) Respond to inquires from prospective applicants. Many of our applicants are unfamiliar with program details, or application processes at NIH, and need significant support during the application process. 3) Conduct knowledgeable screening to ensure applications assigned to NLM fall within the NLM mission and are assigned to the appropriate program. Because completing an NIH grant application is complex and time-consuming, NLM considers it important that inappropriate or unwanted applications are aborted with as little loss of applicant time and expense as possible. 4) Counsel applicants regarding the significance of Summary Statements and on methods of reapplying.  Results of a review, as presented in a Summary Statement, are often difficult to interpret for novices who wish to reapply. Proper counseling is vital for those who hope to prepare a successful revised application. 5)Assist in arranging for peer review. Many of NLM’s applications touch novel areas and require correspondingly novel expertise with adequate attention to gender and diversity. Although Contractor is not responsible for formally evaluating the merit of an application, Contractor will help identify potential reviewers in such instances for potential use by Project Officer for coordination with the Scientific Review Administrator.6) Provide Project Officer with supplementary information useful for evaluating merit of the application and suitability for funding.  Contractor has no responsibility for deciding merit of applications or in selecting applications for awards, but may be called upon to provide incidental supplementary information to those evaluate merit and participate in the award selection process. 7) Provide Project Officer with information relevant to establishment of budget and of budget changes. Contractor has no authority for approving budget or budget changes, but is responsible for transmitting to Project Officer all information relevant to grant budgets.8) Advise Project Officer regarding need for revision of existing programs, and need for new programs. Contractor has no authority for creating or modifying NLM grant programs but is expected to call attention of Project Officer to areas that might benefit from revaluation as suggested by Contractor’s experience in the field with applicants. 9) Interact as needed with the NIH IMPAC system to carry out responsibilities. The NIH grant process, from application through award and oversight, is administered through the IMPAC database system. Contractor will interact with the system as needed to carry out responsibilities and will be expected to maintain expertise as the database system evolves. Such interaction does not empower Contractor to make changes or entries in the IMPAC databases. The Project Officer, if necessary, must perform such entries, a) Report to Project Officer and Division Director on Status of Assigned Responsibilities. Contractor will provide overall report on all activities and on the state of each program in the portfolio as needed but at least twice yearly. b) Perform other grant support tasks as required by the Project Officers. A significant portion of NLM's mission is conducted through grant awards to investigators and specialists across the nation who can conduct projects that further the mission of NLM. The Division of Extramural Programs (EP) of the National Library of Medicine provides policy guidance, program development, evaluation, coordination and overall operational and administrative management for extramural programs supported by the National Library of Medicine. Because of the Administrative hiring freeze on positions GS-12 and above, we are unable to fill our Program Officer vacancy via the normal Federal hiring process. Therefore, we have submitted a contract request to obtain the services of Dr. Susan Sparks, the former incumbent in this position. Dr. Sparks’ direct responsibility of NLM contracts and her extensive knowledge of NLM contract procedures, and training, makes her the best candidate to fill this vacancy.  Furthermore, the training and acclimation time for her is judged to be significantly less than for any other candidate at this time.  She is an unusually well qualified candidate, and it would very difficult to match the breadth of skills she can bring to this position. The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisition for Non-Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced book as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information. NLM Synopsis No. 03-145-CYC.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Cara Y. Calimano, Office Automation Technician, NLM on (301) 496-6127.

<ARCHDATE>06052004
<CONTACT>PHYLLIS MICHEL - pmichel@usgs.gov Contracting Officer 6503294163     pmichel@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The USGS has an ongoing requirement for technical services to maintain, repair, fabricate and install components of the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) and the Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN) and their supporting telemetry systems. The Contractor will also administer computers and computer networking systems used to acquire, analyze, archive and distribute the data produced by these networks. SCSN monitors all earthquake activity in southern California through a network of more than 350 seismic stations. SCSN includes short-period, broadband, and strong motion sensors. Signals from these sensors are telemetered to the central site at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, CA via both analog and digital telemetry. The data from the seismic network is monitored in real-time, processed, and archived using networked computers at the central site in Pasadena.  SCSN includes approximately 1,700 components of real-time waveforms data returned via analog telemetry; radios, microwave, and Internet and telephone route. The analog telemetry system includes approximately 30 radio repeater sites, a multi-hop Motorola Star Point analog microwave system. Field equipment includes PC based Earthworm hubs, and Quanterra and Kinemetrics K2 digital data loggers. The digital dataloggers are telemetered via spread-spectrum radios, analog microwave, commercial frame relay, and Internet connections. The network may be upgraded over the contract period to increase the number of digital sites.  SCIGN is an array of 250 Global Positioning System (GPS) stations distributed throughout southern California with emphasis on the greater Los Angeles metropolitan region. It is a geodetic network made up of GPS antennas and receivers. The USGS maintains 200 SCIGN stations, its telemetry system, and data download for all 250 stations. The network includes Ashtech choke ring antennas connected to either Ashtech Z12 or Micro-A receivers. Telemetry is carried over spread spectrum radios. Computer systems to be managed include a network of approximately 30 workstations, servers, and printers, and all installed software and peripheral devices. Operating systems include SUN Solaris, FreeBSD UNIX, VMS (to be phased out in the first year of the contract), and Linux. The local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN) hardware and software components include terminal servers, routers, bridges, hubs, switches and wiring.  Software development services may be added in option periods of the contract. Contractor personnel will travel within southern California, often to remote desert and mountain areas where harsh conditions may prevail. The USGS will provide suitable vehicles. The primary duty station will be the USGS office in Pasadena, CA, but Contractor may station some personnel at other locations in southern California. USGS will provide electronics test equipment and data analysis tools appropriate for the systems being maintained. Anticipated contract term is one year commencing 9/1/2003 plus four one-year option periods.  Anticipated contract type firm is fixed price, with overtime and emergency services on labor-hour basis.  A single contract is planned. The RFP will be issued on the NBC website but proposals must be submitted to the address to be shown on the RFP. Send questions about the requirement to the contracting officer at pmichel@usgs.gov. See Note 26.

<DESC>The purpose of the Commercial Law and Economic Regulation (CLER) Program is to provide technical assistance to the Republic of Armenia in the areas of commercial law, trade policies, and economic regulation.  This program will provide technical assistance, training, and commodities to selected counterparts, including the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE), the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development (MTED), the State Procurement Agency (SPA), the Economic Courts, the State Commission on the Protection of Economic Competition (SCPEC), and the Multi-Utility Regulator (MUR).  The program’s goal is to facilitate the reform process of Armenia’s legal, regulatory, and administrative entities that promote the development of commercial law.

Although much of the legislative framework has been enacted, much work remains to refine this legislation and to strengthen those institutions that are responsible for implementing and enforcing this legislation.  This program will focus on other elements related to creating an environment that supports the growth of the private sector, including commercial law, trade policy, and economic regulatory bodies that promote fair competition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) intends to enter into sole source negotiations with Nominum, Inc. for its Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure hardening project.  The Defense Information System Agency (DISA), Applications Engineering Directorate, Center for Information Assurance  (API) is chartered to provide Information Security (INFOSEC) architecture and engineering support for the Department of Defense (DOD) Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure. DNS is a distributed database used to map host names to and from the network addresses.  DNS consists of several domain name servers connected to the Internet operating in a hierarchical manner and maintained independently.  Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND), developed by the Internet Software Consortium (ISC), is the most common software used for DNS both on the Internet at large and within the Defense Information System Network (DISN).  The publicly distributed BIND software presents several road blocks to the DNS security planning.  The specifications for BIND are based on the DNS security standards maintained by the International Engineering Task Force (IETF), which makes it difficult to integrate DISA/DOD DNS requirements into the IETF standards.  Additionally, the software released by ISC is freely distributed for public use, leaving DISA/DOD with no control of when and how the release will be made.  It is, therefore, DISA’s intent and interest to seek expert engineering services and support having corporate knowledge with commercially available software which will be integrated with the DISA/DOD requirements as needed, to ultimately control new software releases with specific, required features.  DISA is requesting a base year and two 12 month option periods of contractor engineering services and support to evaluate the existing architecture, make recommendations for enhancements, develop, test and implement specific applications customized for the DISA/DOD DNSSEC to secure and harden the entire DOD DNS infrastructure.  The proposed engagement will represent a collaborative effort between DISA and the contractor.  The contractor shall analyze and evaluate the current DISA DNS environment using a specific set of tools to perform extensive tests, validations and operations to accomplish this effort.  The contractor shall provide engineering assistance for the IP naming and address management currently in use throughout DISA and DOD using a staged approach:  Planning, Discovery, Design, and Execution.  The contractor shall continue to provide engineering support to secure and harden the DISA-DOD DNS infrastructure through a gradual implementation, deploying the DNS security solutions via a subset of the network, then expanding the solutions to cover all of the DNS throughout the base year and option years.  

The scope of this work includes, but is not limited to, expert technical and engineering support for:  assisting DISA in qualitatively and quantitatively understanding its DNS infrastructure; assisting DISA in securing the DOD DNS, including recommendations, architecture assistance, piloting efforts and implementation assistance during the Nominum Authoritative Name Server (ANS) and Caching Name Server (CNS) pilots and ongoing engineering support for this effort; validating the effectiveness of the Nominum commercial IP name and address management infrastructure in securing the DNS at DISA and DOD through the execution of a detailed Pilot Plan; providing engineering support during the functional and performance tests of the DNS Response Validator (DRV) for new and future releases of the software, and utilizing engineering resources to provide engineering support during the pilot and deployment of the DRV.
  
Nominum, Inc. is the only contractor with a suite of tools available on the commercial market, which will effectively harden the DoD DNS and permit the integration of the DoD DNS Security Extension (DNNSSEC) with its product and source code.  Therefore only Nominum, Inc. consultants can provide the expert corporate level of engineering services for the Nominum product line, which includes the Foundation ANS, CNS and DCTS protocol engines.

The Government intends to acquire this service using FAR Part 12.  This solicitation is for notification of intent to award a sole source contract and does not constitute a request for proposal (RFP).  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  No award will be made on the basis of any responses to this advertisement.  No solicitation will be forthcoming.  No telephonic responses will be accepted.  No additional synopsis will be issued.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the Government’s requirement by 19 June 2003 at 1:00 PM to Constance D. Fortune, AQN2, Fax (703) 681-0346, or email: fortunec@ncr.disa.mil.  Anticipated award date is no later than 30 June 2003.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) for the DISN Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Prototype Wireless Service System. 1. Backgrounds and In-troduction:  (a) Among other responsibilities, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Network Services Organization (NS) provides design and development engineering and RDT&E for all information transfer and net-work control systems managed by DISA and used in the dynamically evolving DISN and the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The Center for DISN Evolution (NS4) provides preeminent systems engineering for joint information transfer systems.  NS4 plans, evaluates, and integrates cutting edge information transport technologies into the DISN to provide information superiority services to the warfighter that satisfy requirements under all conditions.  A pri-mary resource managed and used by the Network Services Organization is the Network Engineering Assessment Facility (NEAF).  The NEAF is used for prototype design validation, functional specification development, system transition assessment, assessment plans and procedures, development, exploratory development, feasibility assess-ment, and near real&#64979;time resolution of network operation problems.  It is a key element in the systems engineering process, bridging the gap between theoretical designs and actual implementation. (b) Worldwide demand for wireless services continues to grow rapidly.  It is expected that by 2010, more than half of all information sent in the world may use wireless communications media.  Emerging commercial wireless systems and services are becoming rich in capabilities, and many of these capabilities are becoming hard requirements within Department of Defense and mili-tary C4I architectures. Significant commercial investment has been and will continue to be made to support mobile users, and leveraging this investment for the warfighter is what this work is all about.  Wireless is clearly emerging as the mobile access segment of the DISN networks, and NS4 is working to develop a variety of DISN Wireless Ser-vices so that mobile DoD personnel can securely access the DISN anywhere and anytime.  (c) NS4 is evaluating Broadband (fixed) Wireless Access Transport for local loop bypass applicability, a separate technology that is vital to providing the DISN with increased diversity and reliability over the “last mile” between commercial Points of Presence and DISN nodes on Service posts, camps, and stations.  This activity to date has been at the architectural and planning levels.  It is now time to move to a hardware evaluation and integration stage, which is the purpose of this task order. (d) Leveraging Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) products and services, the DISN Systems Engineer-ing Support Division (NS41) is planning to develop a proof of concept DISN Wireless Voice and Data Services pilot test bed for installation in the NEAF. The Wireless Network Services proof of concept pilot will be used to develop secure extensions and interfaces to the DISN Wireless Network Services, followed by assessment and evaluation.  This effort will allow the Defense Information Service Network (DISN) to extend its wireless services to both the strategic and tactical communities via wireless broadband communication. 2. Objective: The objective of the SOW is to acquire, and install GSM Wireless Cellular Basestation Transceiver System (BTS) and Basestation Controller System to assess and evaluate Wireless services as a part of the project to develop an operational proof of concept pilot. The ultimate goal is to develop and deploy a broadband global mobile DISN Services for DOD mobile users, and tactical war-fighters. 3. Description of Supplies/Services: This is a purchase request for hardware, software and services to procure and install a software radio-based base transceiver station (also including certain base station controller and mobile switching center functionality) compliant with the GSM commercial wireless communication standard.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to issue a competitive Request For Proposal (RFP) for Increasing Belt Use Among Children Ages 8-15.  NHTSA collects observation data on restraint use in motor vehicles through its National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS).  NOPUS results since 1998 have shown the restraint usage rate by both infants (under age 1) and toddlers (ages 1-4) to exceed 90 percent.  However, restraint usage for older children is significantly lower.  Recorded restraint usage by children ages 8-15 was 82 percent according to the 2002 NOPUS.  And that figure only referred to the front seat.  Usage is typically lower among passengers in the back seat.  The objectives of this procurement are to determine the nature and causes of the occupant protection problem among children ages 8 through 15, and recommend strategic approaches for increasing seat belt use among that age group based on collected information.  This procurement is set-aside for 8(a) small disadvantaged business participation only.  It is intended that a fixed fee type contract will be awarded for this effort.  The anticipated period of performance for this effort is twenty-two (22) months.  The NAICS Code is 541990 for this procurement.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a Worldwide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizopps.gov or www.eps.gov.  It is the Offeror’s responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Requests for paper copies of RFP will not be accepted.  The anticipated date for the release of the RFP is on or before June 25, 2003.

The Government also plans to integrate SDB on the A-10, F-117, F-16C/D, JSF, B-2, B-1B, and UCAV.  

The overall objective for SDD is to test the SDB via a comprehensive demonstration of the integrated system.  Manufacturing, producibility, and affordability addressed during CAD will continue to be evaluated and processes finalized during SDD.  The objectives of LRIP are to produce Lot 1 quantities of the SDB munitions, carriages, and containers, as well as the training and support required to meet the RAA date of FY06, while meeting the price commitments.  

An RFP will be issued on 30 June 2003 and proposals will be due on 31 July 2003.  The contractors will submit their contract price and provide firm fixed prices for Lots 1 and 2 (SDB and carriage system) production options, and a Production Price Commitment Curve (PPCC) for Lots 3 through 7 for the SDB and carriage system.  The Government contemplates award of the SDB SDD contract in Oct 2003 to the contractor that provides the best overall value in satisfying the Government’s need, cost or price, performance requirements and other factors considered consistent with the source selection criteria.  No technical data package exists for this solicitation.

This is a synopsis for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will be issued.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has a requirement for the production of recombinant B19 parvovirus capsids in a baculovirus system for use in human clinical trials.  B19 parvovirus is the etiologic agent of fifth disease, transient aplastic crisis of hemolytic disease, some hydrops fetalis, and some chronic pure red cell aplasia.  Using well established technology, parvovirus capsids composed of both the major and minor structural proteins have been produced in conventional insect cell culture after infection with appropriate recombinant baculoviruses.  Structural proteins self-assemble into particles, which can be purified from cell lysates by sequential application of centrifugation, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, and filtration.  Protocols are fully described in Investigational New Drug (IND) BB-IND 8553.   Purified B19 parvovirus capsids should be produced in quantities sufficient for planned clinical trials in humans:  1) for a phase I pilot (9 month phase) dose-ranging study of normal volunteers , approximately 1 mg; 2) for a phase II/III (15 month phase) multicenter vaccine efficacy study,  a single lot of 10 mg.  Capsids must be produced under good manufacturing practices (GMP), including industry standard quality control and assurance and production and delivery must be according to a pre-arranged schedule.  Product must be formulated in the appropriate adjuvant for delivery to participating medical centers.  The contractor would  be required to maintain the  IND with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The contractor period of performance will be a two (2) distinct phase project for an estimated 24 months.   The award of a fixed price, indefinite delivery (requirements) type contract is anticipated.  The solicitation document will be released on or about June 20, 2003 with a due date on or about July 7, 2003.  Interested parties should submit a written request via mail or facsimile transmission to (301) 480-3345 for a copy of the solicitation number NHLBI-PS-2003-019 to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, Building RK2, Room 6146, 6701 Rockledge Dr., Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services on a sole source basis with David Serlin, Ph.D, Brooklyn, NY, to continue services currently being provided by the contractor under purchase order number 467-MZ-201439.  The contractor will continue to provide a range of historical services in related to History of Medicine (HMD)/NLM symposia, specifically the 2003 "Visual Culture and Public Health" symposium (formerly titled "Seeing Sickness: Public Health Crises and Visual Media"), in addition to continuing with the preparation of material for publication generated from the "New Frontiers of Biomedical Research, 1945-1980" symposium sponsored by the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health on October 29, 2001.  Dr. Serlin was himself a speaker in the "New Frontiers of Biomedical Research, 1945-1980" symposium, chairing a panel titled "Psychopharmacology and Behavior".  Dr. Serlin has made significant contributions to the planning and preparation of both symposia by serving as a member of the committee selecting speakers and topics to be discussed.  Subsequent to the award of this purchase order, the program area has determined that the project requirement is significantly more complex than originally anticipated.  Consequently, additional funds, time and effort are needed in order for the contractor to complete the project.  Introducing a new contractor at this point in time would add significant amount of training time, government coordination, and therefore costs to the government.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide service as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The Legislative Information Management System (LIMS) is the legislative tracking system for the U.S. House of Representatives.  The U.S. House of Representatives requires Contractor management analysis and technical services in four (4) task areas encompassing the final stage requirements of the LIMS Replacement Project as follows:

.	Task 1 - Detailed Analysis of Alternative Solutions (UNIX (HP-UX) vs. WINDOWS 200X). 
.	Task 2 - Proof of Concept Demonstration of the Selected Solution. 
.	Task 3 - Detailed Porting and Implementation Plan of Selected Alternative (Option).
.	Task 4 - Implementation of the Porting Plan (Option).

For purposes of this Statement of Work and the work of this contract, the term “port” means the replatforming of application software and data from one operating system to another, where the code and databases are substantially maintained intact.  Changes to components should be restricted to instances where they are necessary due to the differing operating environments.  In addition, for purposes of this RFP, we have stated the current Congress as the 108th.  Since the port may occur in the 109th, the bidders should assume that the port will be for the current and previous Congress at the start of Task 4.  Where this document states Windows 200X, the Contractor should assume Windows 2003 or later.

In summary, Task 1 consists of a detailed alternatives analysis effort that includes the Contractor:

.	Reviewing documentation prepared during the LIMS Requirements Analysis and Technical Recommendation stage (a previously completed stage of the project), 
.	Reviewing the source code, the database, and JCL for the entire system, and 
.	Creating a detailed analysis report that compares UNIX (HP-UX) and Windows 200X as operating systems/environments for the LIMS application with the Natural code and ADABAS tables ported from the original system.  

Task 2 consists of the Contractor performing a proof of concept by porting the Bill Briefs component of LIMS to an UNIX (HP-UX) platform or Windows 200X based platform. The House's decision of which platform will be based on the analysis performed in Task 1.  The Bill Briefs component consists of approximately 308 modules and approximately 53,845 lines of source code and associated JCL.

All subsequent tasks are designated as options to be exercised at the discretion of the House after acceptance of the preceding task.   

During Task 3, the Contractor will provide a detailed porting and implementation plan for the porting of the entire LIMS system from the mainframe to the selected alternative platform.  This plan will need to include the planning for the remaining system life cycle activities (porting, quality assurance and testing, implementation, user acceptance, and sustainment).  The plan must include but will not be limited to the following:

.	The plan must describe in detail how the system will be ported.  It must address whether the system will be ported module by module, bridged to the mainframe, etc.  It must also describe how all of the JCL, source code, and database tables will be ported, converted, or rewritten.   It must address in detail both automated and manual porting approaches.  Since the COBOL and Assembler code must be replaced, the plan must specifically address the source code in these languages.
.	The plan must include a Quality Assurance and Testing plan for the Contractor’s work and define how the final ported 
system will be verified by the Contractor to ensure the system maintains the same (or better) functionality as the mainframe 
system.   
.	The plan must provide a complete implementation plan including a complete timeline and detailed Work Breakdown 
Schedule (WBS) including key milestones. 
.	The plan must make provisions for user acceptance including detailed acceptance criteria and testing procedures to be conducted by end users.  The plan must define whether parallel data entry or other methods requiring extensive end user input will be required.  The plan must also detail any additional training and documentation necessary for end users that the Contractor will provide in Task 4.   At a minimum, acceptance criteria must include successful automated comparison of all publications, reports, and output files within LIMS on both the mainframe and the ported systems.  User interface acceptance criteria must minimally include all data on the current user interface screens within LIMS.
.	Several non-LIMS systems and LIMS maintain interfaces with one another including the Clerk’s website, Government Printing Office, the Senate, and the Library of Congress.   The acceptance criteria must include tests to confirm that the data exchanged remains the same as in the current system.
.	The plan must specify the length of time necessary to transfer the required knowledge to House technical personnel to enable them to fully support the system after the completion of Task 4.  
.	The plan must include a configuration management plan including documented procedures to track changes to software and the implementation of those changes. 
	

Task 4 will be the implementation of the entire porting plan as created and approved in Task 3 and the Contractor will accept responsibility for the completion of the port. Beyond the implementation, the Contractor must provide a warranty period assuring support for twelve (12) months in order to handle contractor errors related to the port that may arise.  The Contractor shall provide an hourly rate for any non-port related support issues.

<DESC>CMS is in the process of issuing a Competitive 8(a) RFP using the Advisory Multi-step process to make the award.  Interested offerors are invited to submit information that CMS will evaluate to determine which sources appear to be the most viable competitors.  

Background:
The Office of Information Services (OIS) is charged with the support and management of information systems architecture, assets (hardware, software and resources), enterprise databases, accesses to data, and operational systems for the Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services (CMS). 

CMS is responsible for, and retains stewardship of, a vast quantity of Medicare and Medicaid data assets. This data contains detailed information on Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and their associated claims, diagnostic, and treatment information.  The current amount of data under management is approximately 40 Terabytes, with an anticipated growth of rate of 10% to 20% per year. This amount of data places CMS as one of the larger data repositories in the United States, and brings with it the complexities of managing repositories of this size. Additionally, CMS has the often-conflicting responsibility of making this valuable information available to the public, research organizations, universities, and congressional members and committees, while protecting the privacy of the recipient beneficiaries. To support these requirements, CMS must develop a progressive and modern database architecture that enables management and access to the data, while providing the capability to protect beneficiary privacy.

The Division of Data Management Standards & Services (DDMSS) is charged with providing highly skilled data and database administrators to assist in the development, implementation, maintenance, and ongoing support of the agency’s operational and enterprise relational database management systems. We face unique challenges due to the diversity of our user community as well as the technologies deployed.  Currently, DDMSS provides Data Administrator (DA) and Database Administrator (DBA) support for applications targeted for a variety of RDBMS platforms, including IBM DB2 on the mainframe; Oracle on WIN2K, AIX, and Solaris; and Microsoft SQL Server on WIN2K.  The databases for these systems are far ranging in complexity and size.  Some databases have more than 300 tables; others employ less than a dozen.  Some databases are as small as a few dozen megabytes in size; others span up to 10 terabytes.  CMS has databases deployed on mainframes, mid tier servers, and at Internet Service Providers.

Submission Requirements:
1.  Describe the specific challenges associated with architecting and providing both DA and DBA support for Operational Data Store (ODS) systems, Decision Support Systems (DSS), and Data Warehouse (DW) systems.
2.  Compare and contrast the roles of Data Administrator and Database Administrator, particularly in the way your company has defined these roles.
3.  Provide a copy of your corporate DA standard operating procedures, standards, and guidelines.
4.  Provide a copy of your corporate DBA standard operating procedures, standards, and guidelines for:
a.  DB2
b.  Oracle
c.  SQL Server
5.  Describe in detail the specific challenges associated with architecting, building, and maintaining Very Large Databases (VLDBs) and Very Large Data Warehouses (VLDWs).
6.  Provide a diagram depicting your corporation’s vision of an enterprise metadata architecture.

CMS will evaluate the above information to evaluate comprehension of the subject matter and maturity of the current corporate practices in place.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST), proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Coherent Laser Group for an all solid-state, sealed, single-frequency laser.  NIST requires a frequency doubled Nd:YVO4 laser, providing 5 Watts of 532 nm l light for pumping a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser.  The specifications for this laser are as follows:   1)Power:  > 5W.  2) Wavelength: 532nm. 3)  Noise: <0.02% rms from 10Hz to 1GHz.  4) Linewidth: <5MHz, single longitudinal mode.  Other Specifications include:  1)  The laser must deliver non-mode-hop, single-longitudinal-mode output; ie, linewidth must be under 5MHz.  Systems based on a multi-axial design (MAD or QMAD) are not acceptable because of the mode-beating noise inherent in this design.  2)  The laser must have a noise performance of lower than 0.02% rms from 10Hz to 1GHz.  This low-noise performance is required for us to pursue our research goals.  3)  To ensure maximum pump diode lifetime, the laser system must automatically and continuously optimize the pump diode wavelength to maximize optical conversion efficiency.  Systems that use an assumed pre-programmed decay rate are unacceptable.  This notice is for information purposes only.  No formal solicitation will be issued.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  No award will be made on the basis of requests in response to this notice.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE.  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date will be June 30, 2003.

The United States Government is seeking to lease office and related space consisting of approximately 3,500 square feet of rentable space in Peru, Illinois.  The space requirement can be satisfied with space in an existing building or through new construction (build-to-suit).  Rentable space must yield approximately 2,906 ANSI/BOMA usable square feet, available for use by the Government for personnel, furnishings and equipment.  The proposed lease is for 5 years firm, and should be fully serviced.  Space must be ready for occupancy no later than July 1, 2004.
Offered properties must be within the city limits of Peru, IL.
After an on-site survey by a Government representative, the area of consideration may be revised depending on a review of the overall mission of the Government agency to be housed in the space.
The offered space should be fully serviced and conform to meet Government requirements for Fire Safety and Handicapped Accessibility Standards.
Proposals from brokers or agents must be accompanied by evidence of their authorization to represent the ownership.  Expressions of interest should include building name and address, or if new construction, the site location.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>PREDICTING REAL OPTIMIZED MATERIALS, SOL BAA 03-02, Addendum 4, DUE 9/30/2003, POC:  DR. CAREY SCHWARTZ, DARPA/DSO, Fax:  571-218-4553, E-mail:  baa03-02@darpa.mil, URL:  www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso. The Defense Sciences Office is interested in new white papers for PREDICTING REAL OPTIMIZED MATERIALS.  This new program represents a thrust area for DSO that will comprise a multi-disciplinary, multi-pronged approach with far-reaching impact. Predicting Real Optimized Materials (PROM): Existing methods for materials development rely on synthetic methods of either perturbing known material systems or substituting atomic constituents in order to achieve desired properties.  This is costly in terms of labor and time and leaves large portions of the parameter space unexplored.  As a result of computational complexity, theoretical methods are seldom used to suggest new structures or to suggest the substitution of atoms in a structure to achieve the desired physical properties.  Instead, such models are generally only used to calculate various properties of known structures. The desired approach to ab initio materials design is based upon inverse methods where the desired properties are input, and the atoms and their relative placement are computed.  Recent efforts suggest that advances in mathematical techniques that reduce the complexity of ab initio methods, coupled to recent advances in the ab initio methods themselves, supported by ubiquitous compute power, would enable material designers to approach materials as an inverse problem.  Moreover, such an approach would suggest synthesis routes for the materials of interest, while exploring portions of the parameter space heretofore unexplored. PROM intends to develop tools to solve the inverse problem, thereby minimizing the number of experiments that are performed, including synthesis.  We would like to invite white papers that are innovative, far-reaching in their implications, and ambitious in their goals and implementation.  The proposed work should be in one or more of the following areas: (a) Development and application of ab initio methods for the ground state of the many body Schrodinger Equation such as:  Density Functional Theory, Quantum Monte Carlo, ab initio Molecular Dynamics, and related methods of O (N) or better in computational complexity that can account for the presence of external fields, finite temperatures, and other perturbations. Development and application of ab initio methods for the excited states of the many body Schrodinger Equation such as:  Density Functional Theory, Quantum Monte Carlo, ab initio  Molecular Dynamics, and related methods of O(N) or better in computational complexity that can account for the presence of external fields, finite temperatures, and other perturbations; (b) Development and application of methods, systems, and interfaces that automatically extract parameters of interest from microscopic systems and produce parameters of relevance for macroscopic systems; (c) Development and application of algorithmic methods that enable molecular dynamics calculations to be performed across multiple spatial and temporal scales sufficient to model clusters of 100’s of atoms interacting with similar clusters or surface for several microseconds; 
(d) Development and application of methodologies to couple optimization methods with ab initio calculations to support materials design; (e) Development and application of new tools to support quantum chemistry that make use of new representations of electronic orbitals to achieve performance gains in excess of 1000 relative to GAUSSIAN based upon algorithmic improvements only; (f) Coupling of inverse methods to ab initio calculations and application of the hybrid method to automated procedures for material designs. In order to provide focus to the program, we strongly encourage authors of white papers and proposals to apply their techniques to meeting the goals of a challenge system.  A set of proposed challenge systems and metrics are described below: (a) Development of non-linear optical materials with Chi 2 on the order of 10 (-3) esu and Chi 3 on the order of  10 (-17) cm squared/volt squared; (b) Development of thin film ferroelectrics with tunability/loss tangent ratio of 100 at 100 GHz and 1000 at 100 GHz; (c) Small proteins for which the computed potential energy of the confirmation in an aqueous environment is accurate to 5 meV; (d) Development of magnetic semiconductors with critical temperatures in excess of 300 K and spin polarization greater than 70%; 
(e) Development of High Energy Density Materials for which Isp exceeds 300 s; 
(f) Development of thermoelectric materials for which the figure of merit ZT is greater than 5; (g) Reversible hydrogen storage material with storage weight percent of 6.5% for fuel cells; (h) Development of a catalyst for selective synthesis of carbon nanotubes by type.  White papers may include any combinations of the above areas.  Although discouraged, authors may propose another material challenge system, but it is incumbent on them to provide supporting information regarding potential Department of Defense applications for the material system, and that the suggested performance goals represent a significant increase in capability.  Submission of white papers that combine developments in mathematics, physics, computational chemistry, and numerical algorithms coupled to optimization and inverse methods, which contain a minimal experimental component to validate the theoretical predictions, and which can be generalized to other challenge systems, are encouraged.  Such white papers are preferred relative to those that focus on experimentation, translation of existing algorithms to parallel or grid computation, or studies that, although addressing a challenge material system, cannot be generalized to other systems.  We encourage the formation of interdisciplinary teams integrated toward solutions to these challenging problems.  It is essential that the preparation of white papers include the following areas: (a) A clear statement of the envisioned utility of the proposed research and development.  We are looking for revolutionary applications and goals that could be enabled if the proposed work is completed successfully.  While distinct goals for the execution of the proposal are required, the vision presented may extend past the performance period; (b) A concise statement of the research challenges, approach, and potential anticipated solutions to the challenges that will be addressed.  This should include explicit timelines for which progress toward the goals can be determined and measured.  Intermediate milestones of approximately 18 month periods, with demonstrable metrics of performance, must be included for the proposed work; (c) A cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline.  This should include a clear description of the human resources needed, as well as funding.  A management plan that describes how the different disciplines represented on the team will be integrated is critical; (d) The white paper should consider phases of development as the challenges are met.  The first phase of the program should include theoretical analysis, demonstrating the efficacy of materials design by inverse methods or optimization techniques, coupled to an experimental demonstration. White papers must be received by 1600 ET July 9, 2003.  Please put the phrase PREDICTING REAL OPTIMIZED MATERIALS in the title of the white paper.  For instructions on submitting white papers, please refer to the instructions for BAA03-02 found at the web site http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso/.  Authors of white papers will be notified by August 29, 2003, if a full proposal will be requested.  Full proposals must be submitted no later than 1600 ET September 30, 2003.  Notwithstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will accept full proposals for this addendum. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Each proposal should 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the area(s) of interest described above, 2) include at least two specific and quantitative 18-month scientific and/or technical objectives for each scientific/technical area of interest addressed in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goals, 3) include clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and transition paths, and 4) include identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects.  Proposed Phase 1 efforts should not exceed 18 months, but consideration should be given to possible continuation of the effort into Phase 2.  If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements.  Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost-shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal. The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds. Full proposals shall consist of two volumes: technical and cost. The technical and cost volumes shall conform to the guidelines in DARPA (DSO) BAA 03-02 of December 16, 2002.  To receive consideration under this addendum, proposals are due no later than 1600 ET September 30, 2003, to the address shown below. Proposals received after that date will be considered under the open BAA, but not under this addendum. In addition to the required original and 5 copies of the proposal, proposers are required to submit an electronic copy of the proposal on a ZIP disk.  EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS: Evaluation of the proposals will be in accordance with BAA03-02. For general administrative questions, please refer to the original CBD announcement, BAA 03-02 of December 16, 2002. GENERAL INFORMATION: In all correspondence, reference BAA03-02, Addendum 4. TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT: Dr. Carey Schwartz, DARPA/DSO; Phone: (571) 218-4536; Fax: (571) 218-4553.

<DESC>This is Amendment #2 to SPECIAL NOTICE, Reference #: DPGP-03-01, titled DAMAGE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM, for the U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), Office of Contracts and Procurement (DMA-30), 400 - 7th Street, SW, Room 7104, Washington, DC 20590.  AMENDMENT #2 IS HEREBY ISSUED TO INCORPORATE ADDITIONAL CRITERIA AND QUESTIONS THAT REQUIRE A RESPONSE WHICH SHOULD BE INCLUDED WITH YOUR APPLICATION SUBMISSION.  The questions in this Amendment #2 will help applicants document and explain appropriate participation by all excavators and underground facility operators, including government and contract.  Amendment #2 clarifies the Note in Amendment #1 which reads:  "The U.S. Department of Transportation cannot award a damage prevention grant to a State unless the State's one-call law provides for appropriate participation by all government excavators, which includes employees and contractors (Requirement added by Pub. L. 107-355)."  Pub. L. 107-355 indicates the following new additional language and requirements:  Sec. 6103.  Minimum standards for State one-call notification programs (A) Minimum Standards. - In order to qualify for a grant under section 6106, a State one-call notification program shall, at a minimum, provide for -
(1) appropriate participation by all underground facility operators, including all government operators; (2) appropriate participation by all excavators, including all government and contract excavators; and (3) flexible and effective enforcement under State law with respect to participation in, and use of, one-call notification systems.  (B) Appropriate Participation. - In determining the appropriate extent of participation required for types of underground facilities or excavators under subsection (a), a State shall assess, rank, and take into consideration the risks to the public safety, the environment, excavators, and vital public services associated with - (1) damage to types of underground facilities; and (2) activities of types of excavators.
(c) Implementation. - A State one-call notification program also shall, at a minimum, provide for and document - (1) consideration of the ranking of risks under subsection (b) in the enforcement of its provisions; (2) a reasonable relationship between the benefits of one-call notification and the cost of implementing and complying with the requirements of the State one-call notification program; and (3) voluntary participation where the State determines that a type of underground facility or an activity of a type of excavator poses a de minimis risk to public safety or the environment; (d) Penalties. - To the extent the State determines appropriate and necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter, a State one-call notification program shall, at a minimum, provide for - (1) administrative or civil penalties commensurate with the seriousness of a violation by an excavator or facility owner of a State one-call notification program; (2) increased penalties for parties that repeatedly damage underground facilities because they fail to use one-call notification systems or for parties that repeatedly fail to provide timely and accurate marking after the required call has been made to a one-call notification system;                                                               (3) reduced or waived penalties for a violation of a requirement of a State one-call notification program that results in, or could result in, damage that is promptly reported by the violator; (4) equitable relief; and (5) citation of violations.  The State applicant must show how its State's One-Call notification system protects facilities.  If exempt, please answer the following questions and provide copies of the supporting documentation for your replies.  This documentation should include but not be limited to your state laws, legislative acts, and policies.  The State applicant must document how State government and contract workers and excavators participate appropriately in a state's one-call notification system.  Answering these questions will help the applicant prepare the documentation and explanation.  Question 1: Does your State one-call notification system exempt participation by State workers or contractors?  (Yes/No)   If No, this indicates the desired level of participation.  Proceed to the next topic.  If Yes, please respond to these questions:  (1)  How do government and contract workers comply with State One-Call laws?; (2) Why are government workers and contractors exempt?; (3) What risks were considered when the law was written?; (4) Has your State assessed its one-call/damage prevention against the best practices in the Common Ground Report or Is your State adopting best practices in the Common Ground Report?  If so, which ones?  Give Details.; (5) Do State employees participate in your State's Common Ground Alliance?  Amendment #2 is also to extend the deadline date for Announcement DPGP-03-01 until June 27, 2003.  Note that the basic announcement and Amendment #1 of this program were posted on FedBizOps and on the RSPA website: www.rspa.dot.gov/contracts.html on April 29, 2003 and May 1, 2003, respectively.

The opening date is on or around June 20, 2003, the closing date is August 4, 2003 at 2:00 p.m. EST.

Question 8: If option 4 is not ordered, is (sputtering) process pressure to be controlled upstream via MFC with the gate valve in a fixed position?  Answer 8: Yes.  Question 9: What material will be used to demonstrate film thickness uniformity?  Answer 9: The following material will be used to demonstrate film thickness uniformity:  Cu, Si3N4, SiO2, and Al.  Question 10: Is IR heating via quartz lamps the desired method of heating the substrates?  Answer 10:  Yes, IR heating via quartz lamps is the desired method of heating the substrates.  Question 11: Is a deposition rate controller required?  If so, will it be used to control deposition rate & total thickness, how many sensors?  Any preferred brand?  Answer 11: A deposition rate controller is not required.  Question 12:  Regarding option 14, does this refer to the planetary assembly?  If so, are we to propose this feature as one that can be added later, or if it is ordered, can it be integral with the planetary assembly.  Answer 12: Yes option 14 refers to the planetary and yes it can be integral to the planetary assembly. Question 13: How many sputtering, bias / etch power supplies are to be provided with the base system?  Answer 13: Two are required for the base system.

***Questions & Answers Part 2 - 
RFQ#SB1341-03-Q-0495 -

Answer:  Purchase made in 2002 was for one transmitter/instrument package and one receiver/base station.  

2)	Is the current solicitation for 4 transmitters and 4 base stations? Or 4 transmitters and 1 base station?

Answer:  The fire fighter monitor systems shall consist of four (4) transmitting instrument packages and four (4) base stations. 

3)	Will a base station ever need to accommodate more than one transmitter at a time?

Answer:   Each base station shall accommodate a minimum of one transmitting instrument package.  If a contractor wants to provide a base station that can accommodate more than one instrument package that is acceptable as long as the contractor provides four separate base stations, which means a single base station that can accommodate two instrument packages only counts as one base station.******

AFSVA will not provide reimbursement for any expenses incurred in connection with the RFI, including the costs of preparing a response, providing any additional information, attending an interview or demonstration.

3.	Description.  The Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA) is requesting information on sources capable of providing COTS hardware and software, as well as design tailoring, development, test, implementation, fielding guidance, and sustainment services to achieve a single information system, which supports all of the Air Force Services entities worldwide as well as associated reporting and decision making processes. Respondents may be single entities or teams from any combination of any Federal Department/Agency or a commercial firm (both referred to as the Firm). 

4.	Scope.  The scope of this RFI is to examine COTS accounting, payroll, and time management systems in order to determine the potential for adapting to the AFSVA financial system in a single, shared service center environment. Included in the scope is a request for demonstration.

5.	Background Information.  The AFSVA mission is to help field commanders increase combat capability and improve programs promoting readiness, esprit de corps, and quality of life for Air Force personnel.  This mission is accomplished through excellence in core competencies, focused innovation, and systematic delivery of products and services to meet the Air Forces constantly changing needs. AFSVA offers a full range of military and community support programs at most major AF installations.  Programs such as troop support, dining facilities, libraries, and fitness centers directly support the unit readiness mission by providing a physically and mentally fit force.  

AFSVA is a globally distributed major business operation that can be compared to a Fortune 500 commercial company:

For AFSVA to provide the highest possible service to AF personnel, a business process re-engineering study was conducted.  By examining industry best practices, it was found that consolidation of the accounting functions into a Shared Service Center (SSC) and replacing the existing accounting system would best support the agency’s goals and mission.

<DESC>The Blood Diseases and Resources Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is conducting a market survey to assess the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms to perform as the Coordinating Center for Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II (REDS-II). The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size is 500 employees.   The objectives of REDS-II are to conduct epidemiological, laboratory, and survey research on volunteer blood donors to ensure the safety and availability of the Nation’s blood supply.  This includes monitoring known blood-borne infectious agents, evaluating the impact of emerging pathogens, assessing the safety implications of changes in laboratory and/or blood donor screening protocols, and examining blood supply and availability issues.  Issues to be addressed include:  a) risks of transfusion-transmissible infections and trends through time (i.e. infectious agents undergoing laboratory screening and new and emerging agents such as West Nile Virus); b) ways to reduce risks of transfusion-transmissible infections; c) HIV, HTLV, HCV, and HBV test screening methodologies; d) donor characteristics, behaviors, and donation return patterns; and e) effectiveness and safety of various strategies implemented to increase the blood supply.   The Coordinating Center will be expected to collect monthly donation data from  6-8 participating blood centers representing a minimum of between 170,000 and 220,000 donations annually from an estimated 120,000 to 160,000 donors.  During the course of the study, the Coordinating Center may also be expected to process survey forms for one or two major studies with an estimated 15,000 - 50,000 subjects each.  The mode of survey administration will depend upon the study design.  It is expected that the laboratory component of the study will generate about four studies annually for which the Coordinating Center will process, manage, and analyze data.  The REDS-II Coordinating Center will perform the following tasks: 1) Coordinate and participate in development and finalization of study protocols, manuals of operation, and design of study forms, in addition to reproduction, distribution, and update of protocols, manuals of operation and study forms. 2) Coordinate and arrange Steering Committee and other key meetings as necessary; prepare and distribute agenda, reports, and minutes. 3) Develop and implement data collection procedures for epidemiologic and survey studies; perform all activities of a coordinating center (collecting, organizing and storing for analysis data from blood centers including infectious disease marker data [screening and confirmatory data] and donor demographic data [age, race, gender, education, ethnicity, country of birth, history of transfusion] and study data from the central laboratory; monitor shipment of biological specimens from blood centers to the central laboratory); assure the quality of the study data submitted and stored; provide support and documentation for the OMB forms clearance process if necessary.  4) Train blood center staff in entry of data and completion of study forms.  5) Have primary responsibility to assure prompt accumulation, entry, and editing of study data (screening, baseline, periodic follow-up, special events); assume data will be collected from a minimum of between 120,000 and 160,000 blood donors per year.
6) Communicate with blood centers concerning missing, delayed, incomplete, or erroneous data.  7) Obtain and process laboratory test reports from the study’s central laboratory; coordinate compilation of data collected by central laboratory into a study database for subsequent statistical analysis; maintain a record of studies conducted, the number and types of samples used, and the results of analyses conducted by the central laboratory; compile and manage an inventory of specimens shipped and received by the central laboratory from the blood centers.  8) Prepare technical progress reports in order to monitor study progress, quality of data and blood center performance.  9) Interact with the Project Officer on issues relating to study design, study conduct, and data analysis.   10) Analyze all study data collected during REDS-II.  Analytic and statistical capabilities needed shall include not only descriptive epidemiological analyses, but categorical and longitudinal data analyses, multivariate regression models, and analysis capabilities specific to case control studies, cohort studies, and complex survey designs.  Analysis capabilities shall include the ability to model transfusion-transmitted risks using established models or by developing novel models and methods as necessary.  For laboratory studies, sensitivity and specificity analysis may be needed where there may not be a gold standard.  11) Complete analysis of final study data for delivery in SAS format.  12) Assist in preparation of scientific reports for publication and  presentation.  13) Develop, implement, and update an approved automated information system security plan.  Small business firms having demonstrated experience in performing tasks 1-13 above are invited to submit capability statements (original and two copies).  Capability statements must provide evidence of experience in performing the tasks described above and demonstrate the following: 
1) Qualifications and availability of personnel with experience in the operation of a coordinating center for multi-center, multi-project epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory research in the areas of blood banking and transfusion medicine.  2) Design and conduct of multicenter surveys, and compilation of data sets using mail and web-based data collection methods; 3) Ready access to expertise in transfusion medicine and infectious disease; 4) Adequacy of organizational and administrative structure to participate in a multicenter epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory study; 5) Facilities and resources necessary for the performance of the requirements listed above; and 6) The firm’s status as a small business under NAICS code 541710.  Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP), and responses should not include budgetary information.  The RFP release date is pending.  The government intends to negotiate one contract for the period of five years with an approximate date of award August 31, 2004.  Firms responding to this market survey should provide information pertinent to the requirements mentioned above (original and three copies) within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this announcement to the address shown above.

<SUBJECT>B -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): TARGETED REPLACEMENT MAILING TECHNOLOGY FOR THE 2010 DECENNIAL CENSUS
<DESC>POC: Ann Gwynn Wittenauer, Decennial Systems and Contracts Management Office, 301-763-8856 or Ann.Gwynn.Wittenauer@Census.gov

DESCRIPTION: This is a Request for Information (RFI).  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Background:  The United States Census Bureau is planning for the next Decennial Census in 2010.  In order to improve the response rate for questionnaires returned by mail, obtain better data and cut costs, the Census Bureau is considering a “Targeted Replacement Mailing” (TRM).  Ideally, the TRM would consist of sending another Census questionnaire to those households that did not return the first mail-out/mail-back (MO/MB) questionnaire in a timely fashion.  The Census Bureau is interested in obtaining information from those vendors that possess printing-related technology that might be used to accomplish this task.   The Census Bureau would also like to determine how quickly the TRM could be accomplished.

OVERALL CENSUS SCENARIO: Based on historical data from the 1990 and 2000 Census, we estimate that approximately 42 million households will not return the first MO/MB Census questionnaire.  The 2010 Census TRM task could assume a workload of about 42 million Census questionnaires.   These could be either one-sheet forms or booklet forms.   (In Census 2000, most forms were single sheets, 11” x 25.5”, printed on both sides.  Booklet forms could be eight 8.5” x 11” pages.)  When the MO/MB forms are returned to the Census Processing Centers, a check-in process using Census ID numbers determines those households that responded to the first mailing. A second form would then be prepared and sent to the 42 million non-responding households.   Then there would be some number of replacement forms returned, about 10 million, which would result in a 24% reduction in any additional follow-up work.  The Census Bureau would do a standard Non-Response Follow-Up (NRFU) by having Census Enumerators visit all 32 million households that did not respond to either mailing.  The cost savings by having 10 million or 24% less households to visit by the Enumerators would be substantial.   

There are several possible approaches for creating the TRM forms that are being considered, two of which are described below:

 ¨ Pre-Printing Approach: Print an additional 30 million short forms (plus as much as 50% extra for contingency) during the regular printing cycle prior to the Census, and place them in envelopes for storage.  After the check-in cutoff date, print the address of each household, which did not return a MO/MB questionnaire, on each TRM form through an open window on the envelope. 

 ¨ On-Demand Approach: Print on-demand only the needed short forms with variable non-respondent address data using digital printing technology.  Consider customizing the forms to improve response rate.  For example, the forms going to New York State might have a message indicating the value of a complete Census to New York Residents.

This is only an RFI at this time; however, it is the Census Bureau’s intention to perform a TRM Pilot Study in FY 2005, followed by a realistic operational test as part of the Census Test in 2006.

A description of technological capability and experience specifically relevant to a Targeted Replacement Mailing should be submitted in response to this request for information no later than August 1, 2003.

<SUBJECT>D -- Industry Day Conference Announcement Federal Asset Sales (FAS) egov Initiative
<DESC>On June 19, 2003 starting 9:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. the General Services Administration will hold an industry day conference providing details on the Federal Asset Sales (FAS) egov initiative at the Crystal City Marriott, 1999 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202.  The purpose of the briefing will be to provide potential commercial sector bidders with an overview of the FAS egov business case analysis, program objectives, and the upcoming schedule for the solicitation and award regarding the disposition of federal personal property assets.  All prospective contractors are encouraged to attend. Background:  Conceived in November of 2001 by the Quicksilver E-Government Task Force, the Federal Asset Sales (FAS) program is designed to improve and optimize the way that the federal government recovers and disposes of all types of federally owned assets – real property, financial property, and personal property.  Each year the Federal Government disposes of and sells billions of dollars of surplus under- and un-utilized, seized, and forfeited assets.  Assets are sold to the public through a variety of inefficient, fragmented sales processes that; fail to maximize sales revenues, result in higher costs of sales operations and longer sales cycles, and make it difficult for citizens to find Federal assets for sale.  FAS seeks the services of a service aggregator that can assist Federal agencies with selling and disposing of personal property assets.  The solicitation will focus exclusively on creating a performance-based, best-value solution for selling personal property assets.  Note:  This conference and future solicitation does not include the sale of real estate or financial instruments.  There will be three component services sought under the FAS personal property solicitation; Development (One-Time Creation of the e-Marketplace solution), E-Marketplace Operations (Continuous online sales transactions through single or multiple online auction E-Marketplaces), Value-Added Services (VAS) Operations (Provide interested agencies with optional services to aggregate and channel assets to the most effective online/offline sales venues, and support pre- and post-sales activities, for example: Strategic Asset Segmentation, Refine Asset Description and Standardize Asset Condition, Warehousing and Asset Transportation Buyer Qualification, Full Service Marketing, Inspection Support, Asset Valuation and Appraisals, Settlement Support, Title/Escrow Transfer, Logistics and Shipping, Payment Collection).  Capability Statement:  The Successful awardee and its sub-contractors must have a broad range of capabilities for fulfilling the needs and outcomes of the FAS initiative Successful Offeror will:  Effectively aggregate assets and channel similar assets to the most beneficial sales channel; Charge competitive and reasonable rates for asset disposal channels and services; Use established channels    (i.e. e-Marketplaces/VAS providers) to leverage existing commercial best practices, and create new channels as appropriate; Market to Federal Agencies, acquiring additional surplus assets. FAS’ Procurement, Desired Outcomes:  Increase agencies’ net proceeds from asset sales; Help federal agencies determine the most effective channel available to dispose of their assets; Decrease agencies’ expenses related to asset sales; Accelerate asset disposal cycle time; Make it easier for citizens, businesses, and government agencies to find and buy government personal property assets.  Conference Address:  1999 Jefferson Davis Highway Arlington, VA 22202. Point of Contact: Kyle A. Turner, Contracting Officer, Kyle.Turner@gsa.gov .  RSVP required via email to the POC by 12:30 EST, Tuesday, June 17th with notice of your intent to be present at the conference.  RSVP shall include the following information: Company name, attendees’ names, email addresses, phone numbers, list of current federal government contracts (e.g. 8(a), FSS, GWAC, MA/IDIQ, etc.), business size, and classification (e.g. large, small, SDB, 8(a), Woman-Owned, Veteran-Owned, HUBZONE, etc.).
