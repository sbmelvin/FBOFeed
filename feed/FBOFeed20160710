<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-88. It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. Clauses and provisions can be found at https://www.acquisition.gov/?q=/browse/far/52. The solicitation number is P16PS01815, and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation. The NAICS code is 111940 with an associated small business size standard of $0.75 million. This solicitation is a 100% total small business set-aside, and will result in a firm fixed price contract to a single vendor determined to be responsive and responsible. The Government will consider past performance in determining responsibility.

DESCRIPTION AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. The National Park Service (NPS) has a requirement for a single Vendor to supply, deliver, and off-load quality certified weed-free hay (100% Orchard grass bales). Compressed bales will not be accepted. Vendor will deliver 10-13 tons per month, depending on number of animals to be fed from mid-August 2016 through October 2016 for a total of 70-91 tons for the prime summer season. Deliveries will not be needed between October 2016 and March 2017 because the mules will be out of the park at their winter pasture. Deliveries will resume in April 2017 and continue through mid-August 2017.  Due to NPS barn capacity, no more than 7 tons will be delivered at a time. The amount delivered monthly during the two periods (August - October 2016 then April - August 2017) will be determined by Larry Lack, Trails Supervisor prior to delivery. The amount that will be awarded resulting from this solicitation will be a not-to-exceed price for a guaranteed 70 tons, with an option for providing additional quantity up to the maximum of 91 tons which will become a post-award modification should the additional quantity be necessary, and if so awarded, will be at the same unit price as the 70 tons awarded (refer to the clause 52.217-6, Option for Increased Quantity, in Attachment no. 2).

DELIVERY LOCATION AND REQUIREMENTS. Delivery location is Olympic National Park's Elwha Barn, Olympic Hot Springs Road, Port Angeles, Washington, 98363. Physical location is approximately 11 miles west of Port Angeles. Take US Highway 101, then turn onto Elwha Valley Road, then turn left onto Olympic Hot Springs Road. The Elwha Barn and mule paddock is to your immediate left once you turn off onto Olympic Hot Springs Road. The certified weed-free hay must be clean and free of noxious weeds and seeds, mold, dirt, and litter. The type of hay will not change for the duration of the contract. Off-loading requires Vendor to provide conveyer belt for loft loading, and rotating bales in loft at time of delivery such that older bales are rotated forward and newest bales are stored behind. Deliveries will be arranged in advance between Vendor and Elwha Barn staff. First delivery expected to occur August 15, 2016.

NOTE: This synopsis page contains only part of the solicitation details. For full details, refer to the following two attachments: Attachment no. 1, Standard Form 1449 (SF-1449); and Attachment no. 2, Combined Synopsis-Solicitation (full text, containing all of the solicitation requirements and instructions).
