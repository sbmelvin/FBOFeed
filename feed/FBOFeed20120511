This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) has a requirement for 60 square yards of RayonFelt.  The rayon felt must be 7-inches thick, so that NASA ARC may carbonize it, whichwill result in a 3-inch thick carbon felt.  For TPS applications, NASA requiresthicknesses of greater than 3-inches for the thermal protection of flight vehicles. Carbon felt is the precursor for conformable ablators, currently under investigation atNASA ARC, which offer many advantages over rigid ablators for large heat shields.Commercially available carbon felts are currently manufactured in thicknesses of 1-inchor less.  NASA intends to procure the rayon felt on a sole source basis from American Felt & FilterCompany, Inc. (AFFCO) of New Windsor, NY, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Market research conducted by NASA ARC within the past year, including the posting of RFI# NNA11TPSRFIL-AMD indicates that only AFFCO is capable of producing a rayon felt atleast 7 inches thick to meet the NASA requirement.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) services of a phenolicmatrix into a NASA-provided 3D woven carbon fiber preform material.  Work will includenon-recurring design engineering services with flat mold tooling to accommodate variousdimensions, including up to 3 inches thick materials.  NASA has purchased the 3D wovenmaterials under a separate procurement and the cost of the materials alone are greaterthan the RTM services.	Thus it is imperative that NASA has confidence that the RTMservices will be performed correctly and consistently so that the materials are notdamaged or destroyed.NASA intends to extend the period of performance and order additional RTM services on PO# NNA12AA62P with Compositex, Inc. of Sandy, UT, under the authority of FAR13.106-1(b)(1).  Market research conducted by NASA before award of the current POindicated that only Compositex has a process in place to provide RTM services on aphenolic matrix of thicknesses greater than 1 inch.  In addition, it is important thatfuture parts provide compatible performance data and uniformity with previously processedparts.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon May 25, 2012.

The intent of the USAITA is to be a customer-focused service provider that provides, manages, operates, and maintains Information Technology shared services for the Pentagon Area and select agencies and organizations in the National Capital Region (NCR). The Department of Defense Directive stated that USAITA was to be the central source for IT services, and therefore eliminate the requirement for each Department of Defense component to establish, operate and maintain duplicative technology. The policy also explicitly directed USAITA to manage costs, as the directive outlined the responsibility to operate as a business, and continually evaluate new commercial alternatives to providing existing capabilities in the interest of finding cost savings.<br><br>USAITA is a field-operating agency under the operational control of the Army's Office of the Administrative Assistant. USAITA is an Information Technology (IT) service provider, and provides a range of shared services to the National Defense community. USAITA's customer base consists primarily of Department of Defense services and agencies inside of the National Capital Region (NCR).<br><br>The requirement is being prepared in accordance with the format FAR Part 15 anticipated to be a full and open competitive solicitation. The associated NAICS code is 541511. The size standard is $25 Million. The Government anticipates awarding a single award contract from the final solicitation. The period of performance is TBD.

<DESC>Market Survey Sources Sought to Provide aPratt & Whitney Canada (PWC) PT6A-135A Maintenance/Overhaul Program
General Information:
	The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Inspection Services (FIS) is conducting a Market Survey looking for sources/vendors that can provide an Engine Maintenance/Overhaul program for eighteen (18) FAA owned PWC PT6A-135A engines.  Twelve (12) engines are currently in-service and installed on six (6) FAA Hawker Beechcraft (HBC) C90GTi aircraft and six (6) additional engines are expected on three (3) new HBC C90GTi aircraft with planned deliveries in August 2012 and July 2013.
This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.
The FAA is considering obtaining a Maintenance/Overhaul program for their PT6A-135A engines that covers the cost of maintenance, labor, and parts on a cost per engine operating hour basis.  Other support coverage is desired as part of the program and would cover maintenance events, parts, or engine services that are not covered as a cost per engine operating hour basis.  Other support coverage would be requested as needed and the cost would be considered as an Over & Above (O&A) basis using a time and materials format.  The engines are covered under the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) warranty plan through a specified calendar date or number of engine hours as shown in the "draft" Statement of Work (SOW).
The "draft" SOW which describes the desired coverage, program requirements, is included with this Market Survey. Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments.  If you are viewing this announcement through Fed Biz Ops (www.fbo.gov) the attachments may not be available or viewable.  If so, please proceed to the FAA's Contract Opportunities Website at faaco.faa.gov to obtain the attachments.  
All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense. Costs provided are for market survey/informational purposes only and shall not be considered as an offer to do business.
Response to this Market Survey:
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable. The FAA will require this information in development of the bidders list if and when this requirement proceeds to the acquisition phase.  
Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.
All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead.  No type font less than 12-point may be used.  Responses must be received no later than 3:30 P.M, Central Time on 25 May 2012.  Market survey responses received after the time and date specified will be determined to be late and may not be considered.  
The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy.  Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) or Small Business, or open it up for full and open competition.  The information identified from this market survey may result in a restricted Screening Process when the RFP is issued.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for planning purposes only. The NAICS code for this effort is 336412 "Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing" with a size standard of 1000 employees.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:        Type of services provided by your firm,         Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide          detailed information and past performance),         Number of years in business,        Experience with PT6A-135A engine maintenance programs.
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses. 
The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the email addresses shown below.  Submissions may be provided in a portable document format (pdf); however, Microsoft Word is acceptable.  Responses must not exceed a total of 30 pages. 
Point of contact is John Hawk, Contracting Officer, telephone (405) 954-5102.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to the Institute of Human Virology, Plot 252 Herbert Macaulay Way, CBD, Abuja, Nigeria laboratory to provide services on the genetics of type 2 diabetes in Africa.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), mission of the Center for Research on Genomics and Global Health (CRGGH) is to advance research into the role of culture, lifestyle, genetics and genomics in health disparities. The CRGGH will develop genetic epidemiology models and conduct population genetics research that explores the patterns and determinants of common complex diseases, such as Type 2 Diabetes, hypertension and obesity in the US, Africa and China. The CRGGH will give particular thought to ways in which scientist document and describe the non-random pattern of human genetic variation and its link to disease risks in different populations. The overall goal of the Center for Research on Genomics and Global Health (CRGGH) project on the genetics of type 2 diabetes among Yoruba is to accumulate sufficient number of cases and controls (n &gt; 4000 persons) to conduct Whole Genome Association studies (GWAS). The current proposal will contribute 400 persons (200 unrelated T2D subjects and 200 ethnicity matched controls) to this larger effort.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objectives for the project are</span></strong>:</p>
<p>1. Enroll and examine 250 unrelated cases of T2D and 250 ethnicity matched controls from Abuja, Nigeria.</p>
<p>2. Conduct clinical examination and complete study questionnaires to obtain demographic and clinical data including age, gender, personal and family health history, blood pressure and anthropometrics.</p>
<p>3. Obtain and process blood samples on each participant. Separate collected biological samples into required aliquot of plasma, serum and DNA.</p>
<p>4. Conduct basic biochemistries on all participants. Biochemistries will include fasting blood glucose, insulin, albumin, and lipid profile (LDL, HDL, triglyceride and total cholesterol).</p>
<p>5. Ship collected samples to the CRGGH at the NIH/NHGRI.</p>
<p>6. The project is expected to be completed in 12 months starting from the date of initial award.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br /><br />The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) serves as the lead agency for the National Children's Study (NCS or Study), a longitudinal cohort study that will examine the effects of environmental influences on the health and development of approximately 100,000 children. Additional background about the Study is available on the Study's Website (www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov)<br /><br />The NICHD intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, follow-on contracts with 17 of the current Wave I NCS Study Center contractors identified below for a period of 6 months the purpose of which is to the continue limited NCS activities beyond their September 27, 2012 contract completion dates. The contracts will be awarded under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) and HHSAR 306.302-1(a)(2)(iv). <br /><br />WAVE I STUDY CENTER (CONTRACTOR) - LOCATION (COUNTY)<br />1. University of California, Irvine -&nbsp;San Diego, CA<br />2. University of New Mexico - Valencia, NM<br />3. St. Louis University - St Louis, MO<br />4. University of Hawaii - Honolulu, HI<br />5. Northwestern University - Cook, IL<br />6. University of California, Los Angeles - Los Angeles, CA<br />7. University of Minnesota - Ramsey, MN<br />8. University of Pittsburgh - Westmorland, PA<br />10. Brown University - Providence, RI<br />11. University of California, Davis - Sacramento, CA<br />12. University of Texas, San Antonio - Bexar, TX<br />13. Yale University - New Haven, CT<br />14. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia - Schuylkill, PA<br />15. Michigan State University - Wayne, MI<br />16. University of Mississippi - Hinds, MS<br />17. University of North Carolina - Durham, NC</p>
<p>For the period of September 28, 2012 - March 29, 2013 contractors will ensure they have the staff and facilities sufficient to conduct the following activities:<br /><br />&bull; Complete the development and implementation of a Transition Plan that is sufficiently detailed to ensure an efficient and complete transition of Study responsibilities to a possible successor preventing any disruption in Study visits, data collection, data transfer, or other research activities.<br />&bull; Continue Study-related data collections that may take place in the home, in the community, by telephone, other remote setting or in a clinical or specific Study setting. <br />&bull; Transmit Operational and Study data to the NCS-Program Office according to the Study specifications.<br />&bull; Track receipt of self-administered forms and enter this hard copy data into their approved electronic format for transmission to the NCS Vanguard Data Repository (VDR). <br />&bull; Ensure compliance with ongoing quality control procedures described in the Study Protocol and in the study procedural manual. <br />&bull; Comply with all Institutional Review Board (IRB), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements.<br />&bull; Meet via phone and/or face-to-face with the Contracting Officer Representative(s) and other staff to review progress and anticipated or existing problems.<br />&bull; Adhere to the policies of the NCS Publications Committee and the Data Access Committee.</p>
<p>Under the existing contracts the Wave I Study Centers in their respective locations (counties) have recruited, tracked, retained and collected data on a cohort of participants. They have conducted home visits to collect biospecimens, environmental samples, and other analytical materials. The primary goal of these follow-on contracts is to retain the current participants; conduct limited data collection, and prepare for the transition of all NCS activities to a successor contractor. Given those objectives, the extent of contractor activities, data rights restrictions, and other pertinent factors, there is no reasonable expectation that another contractor(s) could assume the activities of these centers for a period of 6 months. In addition, transfer of the personally identifiable information (PII) being safeguarded by the existing contractors cannot be released to another prospective contractor without proper authorization, a lengthy process that could result in unacceptable delays to current Study requirements.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal. However, if any responsible source believes it can perform the above requirements they may submit three (3) copies of their capability statement for consideration by the NICHD to Howard O. Cyrus Jr., Contracting Officer, NICHD Office of Acquisitions, Contract Management Branch, 6100 Executive Blvd., Bethesda, MD 20892-7510. Phone number 301-435-6963; email hc163b@nih.gov All responses must be received in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NICHD Contracting Office and the NCS Program Office to make a determination that the party can or cannot perform this requirement. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Professional Components Ltd. 2074 Henry Ave., Sidney BC, V8L 3S6 for five (5) LCAC Starboard Cabin Seats P/N: SWP-1054 and four (4) LCAC Port Cabin Seats P/N: SWP-1055. This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The new LCAC operator seat has a unique set of requirements to keep the operators safe from dangerous level of whole body vibration (WBV) exposure in the LCAC operational environment; whereas the current LCAC seats do not meet this requirement. In addition to the WBV requirement, the new LCAC seats must meet the new geometric requirement.
 Professional Components is the only manufacturer whose seats fit in the Wave Commander and Troop Commander seat locations and meet NSWC PCDs minimum WBV requirement.
Professional Components is the only known vendor for these specific part numbered items, that meets form, fit and function requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to award this proposed purchase order, based upon the response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Anticipated award date will be on or about 30 May 2012. Delivery will be to the Receiving Office, Naval Support Activity-Panama City (NSA-PC), Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to solicit Carleton Life Support Systems Incorporated  doing business as Cobham Mission System, 2734 Hickory Grove Road, Davenport, IA 52804 on a sole source basis for the acquisition of spare parts and components for the Explosive Ordnance Disposal MK 16 Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UBA).  The components being acquired are twenty-five (25) MK11 Compensators (P/N B60040-1). This procurement is sole source for the following reasons. The MK 16 UBA is a NAVSEA Certified Diving Life Support System (DLSS). Cobham Mission Systems is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MK 16.  As the OEM, only Cobham Mission System is the only approved source to provide all of the spare parts for the MK 16 UBA.
 Procuring these spare parts from another company would run the risk of incompatibility of components when maintaining and repairing the MK 16 UBA.  Substitution of components is not authorized without the expressed permission of the approving authority. Any variance in the equipment used in a certified system would jeopardize the certification of the system and ultimately the mission.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responsible sources may submit a response for consideration to the agency point of contact at: tim.e.reed1@navy.mil.
   The basis of award is a fair and reasonable price to the Government.  Award of action will be on or about 31 May 2012.  These units will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity  Panama City, Receiving Officer, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407.

<DESC>The term "Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics" (AD&amp;P) refers generally to this application of automated monitoring, condition prognosis, and incipient failure detection. AD&amp;P includes applications to mechanical and electrical equipment. It also includes self testing of digital systems, including calibration verification for digital system (I/O) interfaces. Properly designed and implemented, AD&amp;P can clearly benefit the safe and reliable operation of a fuel cycle facility or nuclear power plant. But it is also possible for failure or incorrect operation of AD&amp;P resources to inhibit proper operation. In addition, the implementation of AD&amp;P involves the addition of equipment and software, and tends to make systems more complicated. Added complexity, unfortunately, brings with it an increased potential for hidden or unanticipated couplings and dependencies, and ultimately the possibility of an increased likelihood of failure. The tasks under this contract will provide technical guidance, regulatory-based acceptance criteria, and recommendations for tools and methodologies (T&amp;M) to support regulatory evaluation of proposed applications of AD&amp;P. These tasks also include assistance to NRC staff in preparing review processes and inspection procedures. The results of this work may result in improved NRC regulatory guidance on safety system network designs.

<a href="mailto:andre.phillips@usmc.mil">Program Analyst</a>
<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Product Group (PG) -12, Program Manager (PM) Tactical Communication Systems (TCS), Platform Integration has a requirement for handsfree communications inside the Medium Crawler Tractor (MCT).  The headset system offered must be commercial off the shelf.  Headset manufacturers will be invited to demonstrate their headset capabilities, which must include hands-free" operation.  Handset Manufacturers that meet the requirements of the solicitation will have their pricing proposal evaluated.  NOTE:  Competition will be limited to the Handset Manufacturers.  Offers from dealers will not be considered.

A solicitation will be issued on or about 06 January 2012.

BACKGROUND: 
An Urgent User Need Statement (U-UNS) was received by MCSC from the operating forces requesting the ability to communicate from within the armored cab of the Medium Crawler Tractor (MCT) in a "hands-free" mode while equipped with hearing protection.
 
Platform Integration (PI) Team, PM TCS, worked with the platform PM and has devised a solution to allow the operator to communicate while operating the MCT. With some modifications, the PI Team was able to integrate the AN/VRC-113 into the MCT (see pages 21-22 of the attached Thales Product Catalog). After the AN/VRC-113 integration, Initial tests were performed using current inventory Active Noise Reduction headsets with Push-To-Talk (PTT) and Voice Operated Transmitter (VOX). 
MCT operation is controlled through the use of two joy sticks. The operator uses both hands to control MCT blade motion (up, down, tilt, roll) and travel (engine rpm, vehicle speed, vehicle turning), etc. With both hands utilized to operate the MCT, the operator cannot activate a PTT switch on the headset when he needs to communicate; hence, the issuance of this notification.

Performance Specifications
- Headset system must be commercial off the shelf.
 No development costs will be borne by the Government.
- Headset system must provide some form of Active or Passive Noise Reduction. 
- Headset system must be Hands-Free. The Platform Integration Team has designed a bracket to house a foot PTT which will be at the operators left foot. The PI Team has also procured a finger PTT which attaches to the right joystick (Blade up/down, tilt and roll). 
 	> If vendor is offering their own finger PTT, the device must be of a design that allows for uninterrupted keying and fit the contour of the joystick while remaining in place. 
 	> If vendor is providing a system that primarily uses voice activation (VOX) to key the radio, it cannot be the only method of keying radio.
 As the operating environment will normally be quite noisy, there are questions as to the effectiveness of VOX in the MCT while in operation in a combat environment. 
- Headset system must be compatible with USMC current inventory headsets which come standard with a Nexus connector. The Vendor shall have the ability to provide their proprietary headsets provided this requirement is met.
- Headset system must be able to draw power from pin #6 of the handset connector on the AN/VRC-113 AMP. This power should be the primary source of power. If battery power is required by Vendors headset system, it must be of such a design to allow effortless replacement of batteries and where possible, cut over to vehicular power once connected.
 
	> Vendors will also be required to notify the Platform Integration Team of the expected lifetime of the batteries in their system under normal use.
- Headset system must have an auxiliary input connector where the MCT operator can connect either a pre-recorded briefing or input media from another device.
	> The headset system must work in such a way that when either incoming or outgoing traffic is sensed, the input to the auxiliary port will be muted.  Once radio transmission is complete, auxiliary input returns to previous level.
- Vendor shall make provisions to mount the headset system in a semi-permanent manner. Headset systems control box shall be mountable on the right side of operators seat with cables of sufficient length to connect to the AN/VRC-113 AMP, auxiliary input, foot and/or finger PTT, and headset.
- Vendors must demonstrate a complete system.
 The system and components demonstrated must be of a readiness level high enough where the testers can install the system as if for fielding. 

Source Selection
- Selection will be made on best value to the Government. The best system need not have the lowest price to be selected.
- A Technical evaluation will be conducted hands-on. Vendors are required to install their headset system into the MCT and an MCT operator and Program Manager will evaluate the headset system based on the Performance Specifications listed above. 
- Any offeror whose product does not meet the specifications will not be selected.
- Offerors that meet the qualifications will be evaluated for delivery schedule (1st 65 units and following 150 units), past performance, and price.
- On the day of the event, vendors will be given one hour and forty five minutes to set up and demonstrate their system.
 Time slots will be set by MCSC Program Office based on vendor interest. 
- Pricing must be submitted by separate correspondence to MCSC contracting officer listed on solicitation.
Cost Breakdown
- Vendors must include the following price breakdown in the proposals:
	> Cost per headset and peripherals (1) each
	>Total cost for quantities listed below.
	> Total cost for spares listed below.
	> Step-Ladder pricing if applicable.

QUANTITIES:
- Current Urgent User Need Statement is for 209 systems, with a request from the PM, MCT for 60 to fill the U-UNS of those in theatre, and 149 installs (3 in CONUS used for training and83 for future principle end item rotations). Each MCT will need one Headset with hands-free peripherals.
- Initial contract will be for a maximum of 215 installation kits, a minimum of 63 complete Installation Kits that include Headsets, 146 Installation Kits excluding Headsets, and 6 sparesInstallation Kits with Headsets (see Sparing below).
	>Vendor must state estimated delivery time after receipt of purchase order.

SPARING:
There is no historical data to indicate what percentage spares are needed.
 Platform Integration is estimating that since headsets are not as robust as the vehicles they are in and are easily lost or stolen, we would need to spare at 10%.  Offerors are encouraged to provide recommended sparing quantities.  MCSC estimates a quantity of 13 units would serve as spares. However, due to the approved funding for the U-UNS, an initial purchase of 6 spare systems would be purchased for the 63 systems used for training and ISO OEF operations.  Numbers of systems initially purchased will vary based upon the unit prices and the available funding.

The offeror should include the individual components (i.e. cables, and line replaceable units) needed as spare parts to support the system being offered.
  Pricing should be provided to reflect economical price breaks with a minimum order quantity of one (1) each.

WARRANTY:
- Vendors will specify the type of standard commercial warranty they provide with the headset solution:
	> What is the length of warranty period
	> What is the process for operators to have warranty items repaired
	> What is the turnaround time for warranty repairs
	> What is the cost of extending the warranty, if needed

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Notice</p>
<p>Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Medical Provider Component</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p><br />A. Background</p>
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) was created in 1989 "to enhance the quality, appropriateness and effectiveness of health care services and access to such services, through the establishment of a broad base of scientific research and through the promotion of improvements in clinical practice (including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions and in the organization, financing and delivery of health care services)." In 1999, Congress, in its reauthorization language, stated that the Director of the AHRQ "shall conduct and support research and build private-public partnerships to (1) identify the causes of preventable health care errors and patient injury in health care delivery; (2) develop, demonstrate, and evaluate strategies for reducing errors and improving patient safety; and (3) disseminate such effective strategies throughout the health care industry." <br />The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Household Component (HC), Medical Provider Component (MPC), and Insurance Component (IC), which began in 1996, is a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals (MEPS-HC), their medical providers (doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, etc.) (MEPS-MPC), and employers across the United States (MEPS-IC). MEPS collects data on the specific health services that Americans use, how frequently they use them, the cost of these services, and how they are paid for, as well as data on the cost, scope, and breadth of health insurance held by and available to U.S. workers. For further discussion of the MEPS family of surveys as well as historical context please see: http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/about_meps/survey_back.jsp<br />B. Purpose and Objectives<br />The primary objective of the MPC is to collect data from medical providers (hospitals, physicians, home health agencies, pharmacies, long term health care facilities) on expenditures for medical services provided to MEPS Household Component (HC) sample persons. Such data are essential to improve the accuracy of the national medical expenditure estimates derived from the MEPS HC, since household respondents are not always the most reliable source of information on medical expenditures. The data also serve as the primary imputation source of medical expenditure data to correct for the item nonresponse on this measure by the MEPS household sample participants. MPC data also serve as an imputation source for item nonresponse to reduce the level of bias in survey estimates of medical expenditures. They also serve as source of expenditure information on physician charges that are associated with hospital care but not billed by the hospital, as well as serving the primary source of expenditure information for Medicaid recipients. <br />C. Project Requirements</p>
<p>Providers for the MPC sample for one year includes all hospitals, emergency rooms, home health care agencies, outpatient departments, pharmacies, and long term health care facilities reported by HC respondents, as well as all physicians who provide services for patients in hospitals but bill separately from the hospital (these physicians are identified by the hospitals not the HC respondents). HMOs are included in the MPC data collection. Office based medical providers where the provider is either a doctor of medicine (MD) or Osteopathy (DO) or practices under the direct supervision of an MD or DO are included in the MPC as well. Data collection consists of contacting and collecting data from approximately 5,000 hospitals, 12,000 office based providers, 500 home care providers, 100 institutions, 19,000 physicians who provide services for patients in hospitals but bill separately from the hospital, and 8,000 pharmacies. Data collection methods may include phone, fax, mail, self administration, and electronic transmission (including CD-ROMS and secure transmission via FTP). Each year of the MPC, all providers shall be screened to ascertain their eligibility, their association with the MEPS household respondent, and to obtain information to facilitate the conduct of the core MPC interview. Currently, an Integrated Data Collection System (IDCS) that includes a Web component in which the MEPS-MPC forms are programmed for computer-assisted data entry (CADE) and a case management system (CMS) is used for data collection. Recruiting, training and managing a data collection staff that includes staff with phone data collection skills and staff with the ability to abstract data from financial and medical records is expected. The sample of the MEPS MPC is designed to provide data on events for which household respondents are less likely to be fully aware of the financial transactions regarding the medical care received, to enrich the sample of events available as donors for imputation, and to provide a basis for methodological analysis of household reported payments for all types of events. The contractor shall also develop specifications for matching data collected in the Medical Provider Component with complementary data collected in the Household Component. The Contractor shall organize the data collected in the MPC into data files usable with the SAS statistical software package with documentation. The contractor shall produce and deliver internal MPC files that include matched and unmatched data and produce matched files in the prescribed format and necessary matching variables and documentation. Appropriate security measures must be demonstrated with regards to maintaining the confidential protection of data collected.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following types of services under this contract:</p>
<p>* Survey/project management<br /><br />* Continue operation of MEPS MPC<br />* Preparation of MEPS MPC documentation<br />* Liaison and cooperation with MEPS principals<br />* Cooperation and liaison with the HC contractor assuring timely, accurate and complete file transfers so the HC contractor can complete editing/imputation work (for all files but prescribed medicines) and public use file development for all MEPS event files on schedule<br />* Cooperation with AHRQ to obtain clearances<br />* Meeting arrangements<br />* Project closeout/transfer of operations<br />* Reporting, work planning, management meetings<br /><br />* Data Collection<br /><br />* Receiving and receipting permission forms that establishes the sample for the MPC<br />* Implementing and documenting sample<br />* Maintaining MPC provider directory including SBDs and pharmacies<br />* Unduplicating the sample <br />* Identifying hospital physicians <br />* Producing data collection forms, advance letters, and other respondent and supporting materials<br />* Recruiting, training, and managing data collection specialists and abstractors<br />* Collecting data from medical and billing offices of providers<br />* Abstracting data from billing and medical records<br />* Coding of ICD-9-CM (and ICD-10 when ICD-10 coding scheme becomes the standard), verbatim medical conditions, CPT-4, verbatim medical procedures and supplies, prescribed medicines, and providers including hospital physicians that bill separately <br />* Identify duplicate events and remove from data file<br /><br />* Data Processing<br /><br />* Providing data security<br />* Forms control and receipt<br />* Data entry<br />* Recruiting and conducting training program for coders, verifiers and supervisors <br />* Recruiting and conducting training program for abstractors, verifiers and supervisors <br />* Data matching for all MPC provider types except prescribed medicines<br />* Producing matched files for use in the production of edited/imputed analytic files<br />* Producing input files for direct feed into the expenditure editing and imputation programs<br />* Benchmarking to outside data sources and previous years MEPS estimates several times throughout data collection<br />* Run edit checks throughout the field period and correct data as needed<br />* Developing MPC internal files (include matched and unmatched data) including a prescribed medicines file<br />* Quality control including interim checks on data quality throughout the field period</p>

<DESC>TITLE: Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) T-6 Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) Sources Sought
THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT.   The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), United States Air Force Materiel Command, is conducting market research in support of a forthcoming source selection for the follow-on T-6 COMBS services contract.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, the Government anticipates award of a five-year, predominately Firm-Fixed-Price contract (one year basic period, with four priced one-year options) with a small portion of Cost or Time and Materials effort.  The anticipated award date is no later than September 2011. 
As part of the market research, ASC will be holding Industry Days on 14-15 April 2010 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, Foulois Hall in Bldg 145, Area B (reference map attached). This event is to communicate with industry regarding a potential T-6 COMBS source selection, specifically the draft requirements, and identify potential offerors.
All contractors wishing to participate in the Industry Day must provide a list of the attending individual(s) name, company, and contact information to the Government points of contact no later than close of business 7 April 2010, so the Government may arrange for base access.  The notification of attendance should specify whether the attendees will only attend the overall group session on 14 April 2010, or would also like a one-on-one session with the Government.  Should the 14 April 2010 group contractor discussion end early, the potential exists for one-on-one sessions that afternoon or on 15 April 2010.  Should multiple contractors want the same time slot(s), time slots will be assigned on a first-requested, first-scheduled basis.  All contractors wanting a meeting will be accommodated, thus specify in the notification of attendance preferred times to conduct one-on-one sessions (first, second, and third choices) in accordance with the schedule below.
Time slots for one-on-one sessions are approximately 14 April 2010, 1:30-2:30 PM and 3:00-4:00 PM;  and  15 April 2010, 08:30-09:30 AM; 10:00-11:00 AM; 1:00-2:00 PM; and 2:30-3:30 PM.   All times are Eastern Time.   
NOTE:  ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS ARE FOR CONTRACTOR QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT ANSWERS OR FEEDBACK ONLY.  ALL QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES RAISED DURING THESE SESSIONS WILL BE DISCLOSED VIA PXIS FOLLOWING CONCLUSION OF INDUSTRY DAY(S).
T-6 BACKGROUND:  The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which uses Non-Developmental Items or derivatives of commercially available items to meet most system requirements. The T-6B is a further refinement which provides for upgraded avionics (including heads-up display). The original T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company, Wichita, Kansas (now Hawker Beechcraft Corporation - HBC) to replace the United States Air Force (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary training aircraft. HBC owns the data/data rights to the T-6A design and peculiar Support Equipment (SE).  HBC or their subcontractors own some data/data rights for T-6B parts.   The T-6 is a low wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer. The T-6 provides entry-level students with the skills necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and navigation during both day and night conditions. T-6 training will lead to a level of proficien! cy that permits transition into one of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks. 
CURRENT ENVIRONMENT: As of this PIXS announcement, there are over 500 T-6A and T-6B aircraft in the combined USAF/USN fleet.  The T-6A and T-6B aircraft are stationed at the following main operating bases (MOB): Randolph AFB, Laughlin AFB, Sheppard AFB, Vance AFB, Columbus AFB; NAS Pensacola (USAF), NAS Pensacola (USN), NAS Whiting Field, and NAS PAX River.  Additionally, the USN intends to begin bed-down of T-6B aircraft at NAS Corpus Christi in 2012. The T-6 production line is scheduled to continue through FY15 with the production of approximately 40 aircraft per year, building to a total fleet size of 768. 
HBC is the prime contractor for both T-6 production and COMBS efforts. There are approximately 6,000 aircraft part numbers and approximately 300 SE numbers that need to be managed; this figure may change as configuration changes are accomplished on the aircraft. Historically, the Government has processed approximately twelve configuration changes each year that involve (but are not limited to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear) and avionics subsystems. COMBS must accomodate these changes as they occur such that no gap exists between configuration change and COMBS services. Current estimates of the number of transactions conducted annually range from 500,000 to over 700,000.  The entirety of the COMBS inventory is Government Furnished Property (spares, consumables, and SE).  If the awardee of this contract is other than the incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft manufactu! rer/sustaining engineering contractor (currently HBC). The Government may also require ACA(s) with major subsystem contractors for avionics, engines, etc.  All aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified processes to maintain airworthiness certification. 
FOLLOW-ON CONTRACT DESCRIPTION:  The follow-on contract will procure COMBS services in accordance with FAR Part 15 for T-6A and T-6B aircraft at the associated USAF and USN sites.  The follow-on contract will be subject to the Service Contract Act.  The Government will provide the initial inventory of COMBS spare parts and SE.  The contractor shall establish, operate and manage a COMBS facility at each MOB (as detailed in the Performance Work Statement (PWS)), to provide a range and depth of spare parts/bench stock including parts for off-equipment/I-Level back shops, spare engines, engine Quick Engine Change kits, engine modular components, repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, SE, and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary to support the assigned aircraft at the base-specified utilization rates (provided in the PWS). The selected contractor shall ensure all COMBS components are FAA-certified in accordance with FAA Regulation Part 23. The contr! actor shall ensure all spare parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for immediate installation on aircraft in accordance with the approved government technical data. The contractor shall ensure all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within each item's allowable limitations and tolerances.  No aircraft component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished by the COMBS contractor within a COMBS facility. The contractor shall only store T-6-specific parts, TCTO/TD kits and SE in COMBS (parts shall not co-mingle with other platforms' assets). The contractor shall maintain data outlining required protective packaging and transportation requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items, hazardous materials, etc) for spare parts and SE subject to special packaging requirements. 
The contractor shall support the bases' and air stations' daily flight operations and any Operating Plan (OPLAN), exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by, incentive flight or open house that involves T-6 aircraft or COMBS. The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables available for the operating command as specified by the base-specific performance metrics in the PWS.  The COMBS contractor shall maintain the COMBS spare inventory and SE.  As T-6 configuration changes are accomplished, the COMBS contractor shall update COMBS services as appropriate.  The COMBS contractor shall perform or subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed reparable components.  The COMBS contractor shall provide their own office equipment, phones, furniture, material handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS beyond what is detailed as Government-furnished in the PWS. The COMBS contractor shall manage hazardous material IAW current Federal, State and B! ase regulations. 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  This announcement is a  sources sought/market research tool to determine the availability and capability of potential sources and ensure early industry involvement in validating the explanation of the requirement.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541614, Process, Physical Distribution and Logistics Consulting Services, applies to this acquisition. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database to be awarded a DoD contract. Interested sources are encouraged to first register on the PIXS Web Site (http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil). PLEASE INFORM THE GOVERNMENT IF YOUR FIRM INTENDS TO PERFORM THE WORK SOLELY OR IF YOU DESIRE T! O SUBCONTRACT WITH A PRIME CONTRACTOR.
No set aside decision has been made; however, the Government is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability.  A key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is the small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  The clause reads, in part, as follows:  "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996) . (b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction).  At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. (2) Supplies (other than procurement from a non-manufacturer of such supplies).  The concern shall perform work for at least 50 percen! t of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials." 
Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.
Air Force Materiel Command FAR Supplement clause 5352.219-9001, "Use of Joint Ventures in Meeting the Limitations on Subcontracting Requirement (Nov 2007)" is planned for inclusion if a solicitation is issued.  If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements must be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.

<DESC><br>Proactive Situational Awareness (SA)<br>Request for Information (RFI)<br>May 11, 2012<br><br>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A SOLICITATION.<br>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, or performance work statements, or performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<br><br>OBJECTIVE:  The Army is interested in enhancing the situational awareness and understanding of lower echelon leaders (Company, Platoon, and Squad).  Currently small units are constrained by limited or no staff-level Intel Analyst expertise, limited access to a common operating picture (COP), and limited time to gather and analyze pertinent Intelligence information.  Critical tactical intelligence data may not reach small units in a timely fashion resulting in surprise attacks.  <br><br>The objective of this effort will be to leverage existing and currently emerging technologies and integrate within the Army Intel cloud architecture to provide situational awareness and actionable intelligence at the edge.  To accomplish this, the Army is interested in extending the current Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) cloud capabilities by creating a company micro cloud to provide mobile Intel information and analysis capabilities at the lower levels and allow for the integration between Intel and Operations applications and data.  Also, the Army is looking to expand current DCGS-A cloud capabilities to provide Intel based threat inference for the squad, real-time tips and cues, and advanced sensing to support the squad.  This analytic result will be used to improve the Company Intelligence Support Team (COIST) decision making process by using collaborative and intuitive visualization thin client widgets that are developed specifically to conform to the DCGS-A Ozone platform.  This effort will also provide two way communications between Intel and Mission Command systems so that Intel and operations data can be seamlessly displayed.  This effort will tightly integrate with solutions from Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Command, Power, and Integration Directorate (CPI) which is tasked with providing the Soldiers with innovative visualizations and decision support services that will depend significantly on information from Mission Command, the new Intel information, and will integrate with the Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P).<br><br>DESCRIPTION: <br>To reach the overarching Army goal to extend situational awareness and understanding to the lower echelons, the Intelligence and Information Warfare (I2WD) is interested in a range of technologies and novel approaches. At the top level there will be innovation in the following areas: extensions of predicative analysis tools and models, tighter integration of sensor data with current architecture, real-time tips and cues with cross domain solutions to provide Intel information to the lowest level, intuitive thin client Intel based widgets, and a micro cloud to extend the processing capabilities at the lowest level.  <br><br>The Proactive Situational Awareness (SA) Demonstration Project is aimed at providing an integrated solution with the addition of the following capabilities listed below. All proposed technologies need to be capable of integrating into a Program Of Record (POR) and conform to the POR architecture such as, but not limited, to the DCGS-A Cloud. I2WD is specifically seeking industry input for one or more of the following capability areas. Responses to any of the following topics will be considered.<br><br>1.	Proactive Analysis and Alerting Tools - Technologies to provide near real-time reiterative threat projection and automated Intel based alerts (include but not limited to): analytics, models, multi model analytics, model frameworks, data mining, and all-source fusion techniques to proactively provide real time situation awareness and understanding. Also, technologies that provide a way to disseminate these automated tips and cues from the analytic and Intel sensor data to small units. Dissemination technologies should consider the potential need for Cross Domain Information Exchange (CDIE) solutions.<br>2.	Micro Cloud - Provide high performance computing environment that supports operations and intelligence collaboration, shared intelligence services, data, and information collaboration across echelons and platforms in real time at the company level.  Areas of interest are architecture, processing power, reduced size, weight, and power (SWAP), and novel ways to sync data to and from higher echelon.<br>3.	Sensor Data Integration - Provide common sensor interface, data correlation, data feed into Squad Tips & Cues framework, and integration into the DCGS-A Cloud.<br><br>Proactive SA will be working with and transitioning results to partners from:<br> 	Program Executive Office Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEWS)<br> 	Program Executive Office Command Control Communications - Tactical (PEO C3T)<br> 	Program Executive Office Aviation (PEO Aviation) <br><br>Response:<br>We are asking industry to provide a response to this RFI that includes the following tasks:<br>1.	Clearly define technical approach and the capabilities addressed.<br>2.	A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for each capability per year, not to exceed 3 years, to include potential integration efforts necessary for the technology to transition.<br>3.	Clearly state the software licensing rights of the proposed technology.<br>4.	State how this effort can transition into a POR and what level of effort is needed to transition this effort.<br><br>Responses to this RFI are to be unclassified and received no later than 1 June 2012. All interested parties shall respond in as clear a manner as possible to each of the areas listed above. Information is preferred in soft-copy Microsoft Word format and shall not exceed 20 (twenty) pages. If soft-copy cannot be provided, written information will be accepted no later than 1 June 2012. You may forward your responses via email to: proactiverfi@mi.army.mil; Subject Line: Proactive Situational Awareness RFI. All information must be in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward written responses to US Army CERDEC, I2WD, 6003 Combat Dr., APG MD, 21005, ATTN: RDER-IWP-KE (Ms. Danielle Duff). <br><br>The Army may require non-government technical experts to assist in the evaluation of white papers and proposals submitted in response to this topic.  Such non-government personnel will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information.  An Offeror's submittal of a white paper and/or proposal shall constitute acknowledgement and acceptance of the Government's use of non-government experts for this acquisition.<br>

<DESC><br>Proactive Situational Awareness (SA)<br>Request for Information (RFI)<br>May 2012<br><br>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A SOLICITATION.<br>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, or performance work statements, or performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<br><br>OBJECTIVE:  The Army is interested in enhancing the situational awareness and understanding of lower echelon leaders (Company, Platoon, and Squad).  Currently small units are constrained by limited or no staff-level Intel Analyst expertise, limited access to a common operating picture (COP), and limited time to gather and analyze pertinent Intelligence information.  Critical tactical intelligence data may not reach small units in a timely fashion resulting in surprise attacks.  <br><br>The objective of this effort will be to leverage existing and currently emerging technologies and integrate within the Army Intel cloud architecture to provide situational awareness and actionable intelligence at the edge.  To accomplish this, the Army is interested in extending the current Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) cloud capabilities by creating a company micro cloud to provide mobile Intel information and analysis capabilities at the lower levels and allow for the integration between Intel and Operations applications and data.  Also, the Army is looking to expand current DCGS-A cloud capabilities to provide Intel based threat inference for the squad, real-time tips and cues, and advanced sensing to support the squad.  This analytic result will be used to improve the Company Intelligence Support Team (COIST) decision making process by using collaborative and intuitive visualization thin client widgets that are developed specifically to conform to the DCGS-A Ozone platform.  This effort will also provide two way communications between Intel and Mission Command systems so that Intel and operations data can be seamlessly displayed.  This effort will tightly integrate with solutions from Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Command, Power, and Integration Directorate (CPI) which is tasked with providing the Soldiers with innovative visualizations and decision support services that will depend significantly on information from Mission Command, the new Intel information, and will integrate with the Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P).<br><br>DESCRIPTION: <br>To reach the overarching Army goal to extend situational awareness and understanding to the lower echelons, the Intelligence and Information Warfare (I2WD) is interested in a range of technologies and novel approaches. At the top level there will be innovation in the following areas: extensions of predicative analysis tools and models, tighter integration of sensor data with current architecture, real-time tips and cues with cross domain solutions to provide Intel information to the lowest level, intuitive thin client Intel based widgets, and a micro cloud to extend the processing capabilities at the lowest level.  <br><br>The Proactive Situational Awareness (SA) Demonstration Project is aimed at providing an integrated solution with the addition of the following capabilities listed below. All proposed technologies need to be capable of integrating into a Program Of Record (POR) and conform to the POR architecture such as, but not limited, to the DCGS-A Cloud. I2WD is specifically seeking industry input for one or more of the following capability areas. Responses to any of the following topics will be considered.<br><br>1. Proactive Analysis and Alerting Tools - Technologies to provide near real-time reiterative threat projection and automated Intel based alerts (include but not limited to): analytics, models, multi model analytics, model frameworks, data mining, and all-source fusion techniques to proactively provide real time situation awareness and understanding. Also, technologies that provide a way to disseminate these automated tips and cues from the analytic and Intel sensor data to small units. Dissemination technologies should consider the potential need for Cross Domain Information Exchange (CDIE) solutions.<br>2. Micro Cloud - Provide high performance computing environment that supports operations and intelligence collaboration, shared intelligence services, data, and information collaboration across echelons and platforms in real time at the company level.  Areas of interest are architecture, processing power, reduced size, weight, and power (SWAP), and novel ways to sync data to and from higher echelon.<br>3. Sensor Data Integration - Provide common sensor interface, data correlation, data feed into Squad Tips & Cues framework, and integration into the DCGS-A Cloud.<br><br>Proactive SA will be working with and transitioning results to partners from:<br>* Program Executive Office Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEWS)<br>* Program Executive Office Command Control Communications - Tactical (PEO C3T)<br>* Program Executive Office Aviation (PEO Aviation) <br><br>Response:<br>We are asking industry to provide a response to this RFI that includes the following tasks:<br>1. Clearly define technical approach and the capabilities addressed.<br>2. A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for each capability per year, not to exceed 3 years, to include potential integration efforts necessary for the technology to transition.<br>3. Clearly state the software licensing rights of the proposed technology.<br>4. State how this effort can transition into a POR and what level of effort is needed to transition this effort.<br><br>Responses to this RFI are to be unclassified and received no later than 1 June 2012. All interested parties shall respond in as clear a manner as possible to each of the areas listed above. Information is preferred in soft-copy Microsoft Word format and shall not exceed 20 (twenty) pages. If soft-copy cannot be provided, written information will be accepted no later than 1 June 2012.

You may forward written responses to US Army CERDEC, I2WD, 6003 Combat Dr., APG MD, 21005, ATTN: RDER-IWP-KE (Ms. Danielle Duff). <br><br>The Army may require non-government technical experts to assist in the evaluation of white papers and proposals submitted in response to this topic.  Such non-government personnel will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information.  An Offeror's submittal of a white paper and/or proposal shall constitute acknowledgement and acceptance of the Government's use of non-government experts for this acquisition.<br>Distribution A - Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.<br><br><br><br>

<DESC>Information Requested:The Bureau of Reclamation is looking for a means with which to enclose a transformer bushing tank (TBT) in the event of a bushing failure.  The preference is to procure a fabric-type Kevlar ballistic blanket to enclose and be tethered to the outside of the TBT which contains sulfur hexafluoride to insulate a GE U-type bushing.  The blanket must be able to withstand the forces which may be exerted when a bushing fails so that the damage to nearby equipment is prevented.
The force or energy needing to be captured by the ballistic blanket will be directly related to the amount of mass set into motion by the rapid expansion of ignited hydrogen gas that has accumulated around the core of the bushing.  Our drawing provides the mass of the material contained within the bushing, and should provide sufficient additional information to allow the calculation of the restraining force needed to suppress the excited material in the event of an explosion of the GE "U" bushing.
To aid in providing possible solutions, drawings and a picture of the bushing and tank will be provided to interested vendors.
If your company is interested, please fax or email a request for the picture and drawings to 509-633-9175 or jwahl@usbr.gov. Please include your company name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, Dun and Bradstreet number and Tax Identification number with your request.  The picture and drawings are available in a .pdf format.

<DESC>The following is a Request for Information (RFI). This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is issued under the authority of FAR 15.201("Exchanges of information before receipt of proposals"). The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Procurement Operations is conducting market research in order to identify potential sources that have the resources, capabilities, and experience to provide support to the "Higher Education Initiative." The Higher Education Initiative supports the mission of the Sector Outreach and Programs Division (SOPD) within the Office of Infrastructure Protection (IP) of the Department of Homeland Security. SOPD is responsible for leading the development and implementation of educational programs that support implementation of the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). In this capacity, SOPD coordinates a multi-tiered approach to academic engagement, education programs, and professional development required to motivate participation and build capabilities across the various audiences that share responsibility for achieving the nation's critical infrastructure protection and resilience objectives. The initial effort validated the requirements and provided a solid foundation through the development of a series of core graduate-level and professional courses that are now available free of charge to academic institutions across the country for use within multiple degrees at schools of business, public policy, engineering, science, health, government and more. Additional work remains to sustain and grow this important initiative over time. The Higher Education Initiative's objective is to create a common foundation for critical infrastructure curricula to be offered in U.S. colleges and universities which incorporates the broader concepts of infrastructure protection such as: risk analysis and management for domestic security purposes; information sharing across and within industries, sectors, and varying levels of government; mitigation strategies and practices to protect against cross-sector cascading effects and foster resilience; and global supply chain management during natural and manmade threat events. An additional objective is to continue the comprehensive, unified higher education program that produces and sustains the leaders and workforce required to ensure the protection of the Nation's critical infrastructure which provides an academic framework that clearly establishes critical infrastructure protection as a recognized and respected discipline. Research and products should apply and adapt the Critical Infrastructure Core Competency model that is identified in the NIPP. This in turn will prepare future leaders and professionals for the ever-evolving complex critical infrastructure threat environment, improve partnerships and collaboration efforts between the government and private sectors, and enhance the knowledge of the critical infrastructure workforce with policy, economics, technology, communications, and other crucial competencies.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<br><br>The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) located in Bethesda, Maryland is seeking to establish a Particle Therapy Center (PTC). <br><br>Charged particle therapy is a type of external beam radiotherapy using ionizing radiation.  During treatment, a particle accelerator is used to accelerate charged particles to an energy that can be used to deliver ionizing radiation to superficial and deep seated tumors that may be located anywhere within the body. These charged particles damage the DNA of cells, ultimately causing their death or interfering with their ability to proliferate.  Cancerous cells are particularly vulnerable to attacks on DNA because of their high rate of division and their reduced abilities to repair DNA damage.  Heavy charged particles (e.g. protons, Carbon-12 ion, etc.) are physically superior to photon irradiation for many clinical circumstances because they are limited in the range that they cause ionizing damage.  Heavy charged particles are physically superior to electrons in many clinical circumstances because they don't scatter within biologic tissues to the degree of electrons.<br><br>The Government seeks sources interested in providing information and subject matter expertise on a two or three room Particle Therapy Center capable of treating children and adult patients with a range of particles to include but not necessarily limited to protons and carbon-12 ions.  A minimum of one fixed beam and one gantry room are anticipated.  The Government anticipates the need for in-room diagnostic imaging to include CT, portal imaging and in-room positron emission detection within the PTC.  The Government anticipates the need for the capability to administer general anesthesia and recover patients within the PTC.  <br>The Government seeks information, including feasibility, and rough-orders-of-magnitude (ROMs) of the prices associated with the following solution sets for a PTC at WRNMMC:<br><br>1.	A complete technical component of a  PTC in or on a government facility to include provision and installation of all medical equipment comprising a PTC, operation and maintenance of the PTC, and training of direct healthcare providers, but not to include direct healthcare provider s as part of the technical component, on an annual basis.  Provide a breakout of construction costs, equipment acquisition and installation costs, annual operation and maintenance costs, and training costs.  Describe space-size needed to accommodate the PTC as well as the PTC equipment to be furnished.<br><br>2.	Costs for acquisition and installation of particle therapy equipment, equipment maintenance, and all training in the use of a PTC system.  Provide costs for acquisition of PTC and separate breakout of costs for leasing the PTC equipment, lease term,  annual costs for operation and maintenance of PTC, and, training costs.<br><br>Vendors are encouraged to identify equipment sources, facility space requirements, and any other information that may assist the Government in establishing an appropriately sized PTC. <br><br>Interested vendors must present their responses in the form of a white paper no more than 20 pages in length. Specification sheets and product information may also be provided in addition to the whitepaper.  Proprietary information should be clearly marked.  Responses to this RFI must be unclassified.  <br><br>Responses should be submitted no later than 1000 hours EST  on 31MAY2012.

VA118-12-I-0340

This is a Request for Information (RFI) the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Information Technology (IT) has identified a need for Identity and Access Management (IAM) as enterprise level services to support the VA Information Technology (IT) systems. "Identity Access Management encapsulates people, processes and products to identify and manage the data used in an information system to authenticate users and grant or deny access rights to data and system resources."  The goal of IAM is to provide appropriate, authenticated and authorized access to the VA and selected business partners enterprise resources. Identity proofing is the process of verifying a user's identity using documents or information provided during the user registration process. Identity proofing can take many forms; it may simply consist of validating a user's identity using information provided over the phone, or by obtaining additional documentation such as a driver's license, social security card, birth certificate, or work visa.  

Identity and Access Management (IAM) has a requirement to integrate remote/on-line proofing functionality into the enterprise Identity Proofing service by August 15, 2012. The remote/on-line proofing functionality will be an integral part of the IAM Services continuing into future releases. Several consumers of the remote/on-line proofing functionality have been identified across many VA programs.  IAM is responsible for providing an enterprise level solution that supports these consumers. The Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP) will be the first of the consumers of IAM's remote/on-line proofing capability.
Information Requested:
VA is seeking qualified vendors capable of meeting VA's requirement of integrating remote/on-line proofing functionality into the IAM Identity Proofing Services. To be capable of meeting this requirement a vendor:

a)	Must currently hold a Level 2 FICAM certification 
b)	Shall be able to provide remote/on-line proofing functionality into the enterprise IAM Proofing Services August 15, 2012 to support an initial user population of up to 10,000 users.  
c)	Shall be able to support a user population that is expected to grow to 100,000- 500,000 users within the first year, with a monthly user increase of 10% after the initial year.
d)	Shall have the ability to achieve a Level 3 FICAM certification by 01/15/2013. 
e)	Shall be able to provide a remote/on-line proofing functionality that supports the capability to proof both online and via telephone.
The period of performance is anticipated to be a 12-month base period from time of contract award with one (1) twelve (12) month option to be exercised at the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Warfighter Protection and Aerial Delivery Directorate (WARPAD) intends to award a sole source fixed price purchase order under simplified acquisition procedures to CREATIVE APPAREL ASSOCIATES, LLC, 318 AUGUSTA RD, Belmont, ME, 04952-3015, for one hundred (100) Female Outer Tactical Vests, as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253, as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This is being done in order to maintain that the design is not prematurely leaked to industry, the need to fabricate carriers with a company who is not a current sub-contractor or prime vendor with current IOTV production is imperative.  Any action that is taken to remove or overcome any barrier to competition could have serious repercussions on the female version IOTV development and could jeopardize the Government's ability to compete a FOTV design under the IOTV ID/IQ contract in place with RDECOMAC. <br>The proposed contract action is for supplies which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This notice of intent to purchase supplies from only one source is not a request for proposals; however interested persons may submit their capability to respond to this requirement to the point of contact listed below by March 23, 2012.<br>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>ACC-APG-CCAP-SCN-Ft Detrick<br><br>Point of Contact(s): <br>Sarah Sun: sarah.a.sun@us.army.mil<br><br>

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command- White Sands Office, has a requirement for Test Engineering and Analysis Support Services (TEAS) at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico. Therefore, White Sands Missile Range will be hosting a one (1) day only Industry Day for the follow-on Test Engineering and Analysis Support Services contract currently held by ATAMIR-WSMR LLC and invites you to attend.
<p>Location: WSMR Professional Development Center auditorium, Building 465, Dyer Street, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, 88002. Parking is available near the intersection of Dyer Street and Rock Island Avenue and also at Dyer Street and Picatinny Avenue.</p>
<p>Time: The event will begin at 08:00 AM. Attendees should plan on arriving to WSMR at least one and one half (1.5) hours prior to the event so you may process through security, obtain a visitor's pass and check-in at the event. Check-in at the event will begin at 7:30 AM MST. A tentative agenda is attached.</p>
<p>All questions will be held until the afternoon session. All questions and answers discussed at the Industry Day event will be published.</p>
<p>RSVP: Contractors electing to attend the Industry Day must RSVP to Mr. Peter L. Hopkins, Contracting Officer. There is a limit of two (2) representatives per contractor. No foreign nationals are permitted. The contractor must e-mail the completed attached RSVP form (see attached Microsoft Excel workbook) to peter.l.hopkins.civ@mail.mil by COB 4 April 2012. Due to security procedures, the persons attending the Industry Day must be listed on the RSVP form.</p>
<p>Las Cruces, NM is the closest city to WSMR, NM. The closest WSMR access gate is located off of US Highway 70. El Paso International Airport, El Paso, TX is the closest regional airport. Contractors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with their attendance at the Industry Day. Please visit the WSMR website, http://www.wsmr.army.mil/Pages/Home.aspx, for more information about WSMR. The "WSMR at a Glance 2011" and the WSMR Fact-book" are also attached for your basic information. Maps of WSMR are available at:<br />http://www.wsmr.army.mil/testcenter/Pages/WhereWeAre.aspx.</p>
<p>Occasionally, WSMR will block roads (including US Highway 70) in the area for missile testing. Please call the Road Block phone number, 575-678-1178, for recorded updates on planned roadblocks. The information is usually updated each weekday in the afternoon for the following day. Since the actual firing schedule can slide due to any number of circumstances like weather or equipment problems, travelers should also check the recording right before leaving to ensure nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Installation Access: All visitors must bring photo identification. To obtain a vehicle security pass you must have a driver's license, vehicle registration and proof of insurance. All visitors must enter WSMR through the Las Cruces main gate (located off of US Highway 70). Visitors must stop at the WSMR Reception Center to obtain their visitor's pass.</p>
<p>Safety: As a tri-service Department of Defense Range, White Sands has tested nearly every type of deployable ordnance developed in the United States since 1945. Quite a number of these munitions were deliberately designed to blend in with the terrain, and their presence may not be immediately obvious to the casual observer. Consequently, even though WSMR performs extensive Range Clearance activities, there is no assurance that any area of the Range is truly 100% free of unexploded ordnance. More information concerning unexploded ordnance hazards can be viewed at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/ux/Pages/default.aspx. The contractors are responsible to view the video found at this link under the title, UXO Hazards Video. You will be asked to sign a form, acknowledging that you have viewed this video at the check-in event. No person will be allowed to tour the range without first viewing this video.</p>
<p>Photography &amp; Video Ban: No photographs or videos are allowed on WSMR except in the WSMR museum missile park area.</p>
<p>A DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) without the Technical Exhibits has been provided for industry review and is subject to change prior to its official release. This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The purpose of this notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described within the attached DRAFT PWS.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the  procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on  the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7105-00-NIB-0064<br />Name:		Round Table, Folding Legs, 60" x 29"<br />Description:	Round resin top folding table; white polyethylene molded top with gray powdered heavy gauge steel legs. Load capacity: 600 lb. 60" Diameter x 29" H. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7105-00-NIB-0065<br />Name:		Bi-fold Table, 60" x 30"<br />Description:	Steel, polyethylene and platinum bi-fold rectangular table with four charcoal gray legs. Load capacity: 250 lbs. 60" W x 30" L x 29" H. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7105-00-NIB-0066<br />Name:		Personal Table, 30" x 20"<br />Description:	Lightweight, adjustable 25" to 28" high personal table. Load capacity: 25 lbs. 30" W x 20" L. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7105-00-NIB-0067<br />Name:		Folding Table with Heavy Duty Legs, 72" x 30"<br />Description:	Steel and polyethylene rectangular folding table with charcoal gray legs. Load capacity: 1,200 lbs. 72'' W x 30'' L x 29'' H. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7105-00-NIB-0068<br />Name:		Picnic Table, 72" x 30"<br />Description:	Folding commercial grade picnic table with two benches. Gray powder steel frame, white polyethylene molded top. Load capacity: 600 lbs. 72" W x 30" L x 29" H. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7105-00-NIB-0069<br />Name:		Utility Table, 60" x 18"<br />Description:	Polyethylene, steel and platinum rectangular folding table. Load capacity: 250 lbs. 60" W x 18" Lx 29" H. UOI is EA.</p>

<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be  authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration Household and Industrial Furniture, Arlington, VA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a) , would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected  firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Intex Solutions, Inc., 110 A Street, Needham, MA 02494-28701 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements". The anticipated period of performance is for a one-year base and four (4) one-year options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">FHFA intends to purchase licenses to the Intex CMO subroutines, databases and software from Intex Solutions, Inc. In particular, FHFA requires 5 licenses to the CMO subroutines and databases integrated with the PolyPaths and Quantitative Risk Management (QRM) software and 2 licenses to the IntexDesktop software. FHFA requires Intex CMO subroutines and databases and IntexDesktop in order to model the structured mortgage-backed securities (Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, or CMOs) held by the regulated enterprises. Intex CMO subroutines and databases integrated with PolyPaths and QRM enables FHFA to model the cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk of the structured mortgage securities (CMOs) held by the regulated entities. FHFA models provide independent risk estimates that inform off-site risk monitoring as well as the scope of onsite examinations. FHFA also requires direct programmer access to the CMO data and cash flow models to support internal model development projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to meet FHFA statutory responsibility to ensure that the GSEs remain safe and sound, FHFA has a requirement for CMO subroutines, databases and software with the following features.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Integration with PolyPaths software</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Integration with QRM software</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This notice is neither a request for quotations nor a solicitation of offers. The government's market research has determined that no other source is available to fulfill its requirements without substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling the FHFA's requirement. No formal solicitation package is available.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Only written responses sent via electronic mail will be accepted. The Government will not be responsible for any costs in the preparation of responses to this announcement.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE BRIDGE MODIFICATION
<p>The United States Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of the Assistant Manager for Business and Contract Management intends to award a sole source bridge modification to existing contract DE-AC52-07NA99344 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c) (1), to Professional Analysis, Inc (PAI), 116 Milan Way, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 for continued security systems services for the NNSA Nevada Site Office (NSO). The proposed modification will not exceed a three month period of performance, consisting of a one month base period with an additional two one-month option periods. The modification will bridge the existing contract to a new competitively awarded five year contract currently being evaluated under Request for Quote number DE-DT-0003527. The solicitation for the follow-on contract was issued on March 15, 2012, with proposals received on April 6, 2012 and is currently under evaluation.</p>
<p>PAI, by virtue of being the incumbent contractor, is the only responsible source for the bridge modification to extend the current contract. The execution of the bridge modification will prevent any potential adverse impact to the mission of the agency, which would occur in the event of interruption or disruption of the work presently being performed. The national security mission of the NSO requires the site to maintain and administer a highly specialized, extremely focused, intensive, efficient and effective security system program. The current PAI contract provides necessary security systems services to support and ensure that this mission is executed. PAI performs Vulnerability Assessments, conducts Operations Security Assessments, prepares the Site Safeguards and Security Plan (SSSP), supports the NNSA/NSO Classification and CMPC programs, provides technical support for the Safeguards and Security Information Management System (SSIMS), operates the Pass &amp; Badge system and provides functional support to access control program, and provides Security Awareness as needed. To attempt to do a stop-gap short- term contract to cover these requirements pending the award of the follow-on contract is not feasible because the three-tiered transition (from incumbent to short-term contractor to follow-on contractor) within a span of up to a three month period would potentially disrupt the site to effectively conduct its mission and to an extent that would put national security at risk.</p>
<p>The statement of work under the bridge modification is to remain substantially the same as under the current contract. PAI will continue to provide mission critical security systems services essential for the NSO to perform its national security mission during the not-to-exceed three month performance period under the bridge modification. These services include the perform Vulnerability Assessments, conduct Operations Security Assessments, prepare the Site Safeguards and Security Plan (SSSP), support the NNSA/NSO Classification and CMPC programs, provide technical support for the Safeguards and Security Information Management System (SSIMS), operate the Pass &amp; Badge system and provide functional support to access control program, and provide Security Awareness as needed. The applicable NAICS code is 561210, Facility Support Services, with a size standard of $35.5M.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a bridge modification under the current contract and is not a request for quotes or proposals and no solicitation is forthcoming. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement by May 25, 2012, 2:00 P.M. Pacific Time, to Ms. Lillian G. Minor, Contracting Officer, National Nuclear Security Administration, Office of the Assistance Manager for Business and Contract Management , P.O. Box 505, North Las Vegas, Nevada, or by e-mail at Minorl@nv.doe.gov. Responses to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and would not harm security interests of the NSO.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NNSA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this Notice. This Notice in no way obligates the Government to award any bridge modifications to the existing contract. Any questions or concerns with regard to the Government's intent to sole source this bridge modification shall be faxed to (702) 295-0564, Attn: Lillian G. Minor, NNSA Contracting Officer, not later than May 21, 2012 , 2:00 P.M. Pacific Time. Questions or concerns may also be emailed to Ms. Minor at Minorl@nv.doe.gov.</p>

Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because: A Sole Source cost-sharing award to the Student Conservation Association, Inc. (SCA) for three interns is required to provide various environmental/conservation support to the Anchorage Fish and Wildlife Field Office (AFWFO).  SCA interns have previously provided these services under a cooperative agreement; the USFWS/SCA National Agreement expired, therefore we request this sole source award to maintain continuity of service with the exiting project.

The anticipated IDIQ award is May 2012; prior to the award of the IDIQ, the FWS is establishing stand alone Purchase Orders to support current requirements. 
No further actions were taken to locate other sources for this requirement, as an IDIQ was anticipated to be in place by May 2012; however, the IDIQ award date has been postponed.   For more information contact Millie Cortes at 907-786-3409 or millie_cortes@fws.gov.

<DESC>The National Park Service, Alaska Regional Office, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed-price purchase order to Aramark Corp/Doyon Joint Venture to install GPS units on new buses as they arrive, trouble shooting of GPS units, and management oversight ensuring drivers are using the GPS interface as required and enforcing the requirement as needed. The Joint Venture is cooperating with the NPS requirement for these Government-furnished GPS units be installed on all Government-owned and Concessionaire-owned fleet within the Park.
This is not a request for competitive proposals, bids, or quotes. The Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please email Contract Specialist, Christie VandenDries, at christie_vandendries@nps.gov with responses or questions regarding this requirement.

Contract No. P12PX24229TAS: 69 8083
This J&A is also available at https://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/opportunities.jsp
In accordance with FAR 6.305, FAR 5.406, and FAR 13.501, this special notice publishes the Justification and Approvals for Other than Full and Open Competition. 
BACKGROUND:  Denali National Park is currently finalizing a Vehicle Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement that will propose to move from a discrete seasonal limit on motor vehicle use level (currently 10,512 vehicles from late May to mid-September) to an adaptive management approach incorporating indicators and standards. The indicators will be monitored to ensure compliance with their associated standards, and 5 of the standards are directly related to vehicle numbers, traffic volumes or traffic patterns: -numbers of vehicles at wildlife stops-numbers of vehicles at rest stops-numbers of vehicles visible in certain viewsheds at one time -the occurrence of gaps in traffic at critical sheep crossing locations-night-time traffic levels. 
The best way to monitor these indicators is by knowing the real-time location of most vehicles on the road at any given time. New satellite-based GPS technologies for real-time vehicle tracking have been developed that allow users to monitor traffic conditions via the internet. 
We have a contract with Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) for purchase and initial installation of GPS units, however additional work is needed to assist and oversee FMS staff while they are working on the concessioner-owned buses, to install additional units in new buses that arrive throughout the season, to trouble shoot the units as problems arise throughout the season, and to oversee these activities and ensure driver compliance with the use of the interface units.  This contract will provide the necessary work to install and maintain GPS equipment in concessioner buses above and beyond the service that FMS is providing. 
1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 13.501 and 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
This contract represents a follow-on contract for GPS installation and maintenance work done by the concessioner, Doyon/ARAMARK Joint Venture (JV) in 2012.  Doyon/ARAMARK Joint Venture owns the buses that GPS units are installed in and performs their own maintenance on the vehicles. They are cooperating with this NPS project by allowing the installation of the GPS units in their vehicles. Without their cooperation, this study would not be successful. The buses are owned and operated by the JV, and access to the buses is controlled by the JV.  Having cooperated with the previous field test of FMS units, they have the expertise required to assist FMS with installation and troubleshoot units.   
If a party other than the JV were to be awarded this contract, we would still need an additional contract with the JV to cover their costs in supervising a third party to work on JV-owned buses.
It is imperative that the bus GPS units be in working order in Denali in summer 2012 in order to continue data collection.  
This work was not originally included in the Concesions Contract. As this is a new requirement and for the direct benefit of the Service, NPS is obligated to compensate the concessionaire for the time and resources required to implement the Service's initative.
2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs Requirements for successfully installing and troubleshooting GPS units in the JV bus fleet:-The GPS manufacturer, FMS, will send installation technicians to install most of the GPS units on the concessioner fleet.  While they are here, the following additional services are required-Organization and scheduling of buses for installation-Insured and licenses drivers to move the buses and test the equipment-Availability of mechanics to receive training from the FMS technicians in the installation of the units for new buses that will arrive after the FMS technicians depart
After the FMS technicians depart and throughout the rest of the season, the following services are required-Installation of  GPS units on new buses as they arrive-Trouble shooting of GPS units-Management oversight ensuring drivers are using the GPS interface as required and enforcing the requirement as needed

3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):  
JV employs mechanics that have previous experience in installing and troubleshooting this equipment. Their mechanics understand how the equipment works specifically with their vehicles. They are constantly working on their fleet of buses and have the regular access to the vehicles required to maintain the GPS units. Because JV owns the vehicles, they also control all access to their maintenance. JV also employees the bus drivers and has management authority over their performance and ensuring the GPS interface is used.
4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  A market survey was not conducted. Due to the nature of this requirement, only the concessionaire can provide the required services, as it is their fleet.
5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  -The buses are owned, operated and maintained by JV; therefore, they control all access to their vehicles. -The GPS equipment installed in concessioner buses is a critical part of implementing a new way of managing traffic on the Denali Park road.  It is important that vehicle GPS equipment function efficiently in the often harsh environment of the park road.  JV has proven that their mechanics are capable of maintaining this equipment in working order. -The JV has been a supporter of this project by agreeing to install this equipment on their vehicles although their contract as a concessionaire with NPS requires no such cooperation.  
6) All actions have been taken by the Government to remove or overcome barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for required supplies or services.

<DESC>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Neustar Inc. ("Neustar"), 21575 Ridgetop Circle, Sterling VA, 20116 for continued Internet-based Telecommunications Relay Services necessary to ensure continued support of assignment of 10-digit numbers from the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) to users of Internet-based Telecommunications Relay Services. A contract was competitively awarded in September 2008 to Neustar for the following services: Implementation and operation of the TRS Numbering Directory that supports the assignment of 10-digit numbers from the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) to users of Internet-based Telecommunications Relay Services (Internet-based TRS or iTRS). The TRS Numbering Directory enables persons with speech or hearing disabilities to be reached using geographically-appropriate 10-digit telephone numbers, for example, by voice telephone users via the iTRS. The central TRS Numbering Directory database maps the assigned telephone number to an Internet-based TRS user to an appropriate endpoint identifier.
<p>In support of persons with speech or hearing disabilities and a statutory requirement to provide services to persons with speech or hearing disabilities, the agency intends to award a sole source modification, for an additional six months of service, to Neustar Inc for iTRS services. Neustar is currently providing highly specialized iTRS services to the Commission through the use of proprietary systems and processes it has developed. Another vendor would not be able to replicate these services in a timely manner without using the same proprietary processes, thereby compromising the integrity program and a lapse in service would surely occur. Therefore, Neustar is deemed as the only source capable of performing the work required, during the required time period.</p>
<p>The FCC is not soliciting quotes from other parties and this notice is for informational purposes only. If you believe you can do this follow on work please submit your capabilities by the closing date of this announcement. Responses may be emailed to the contracting officer prior to the closing date.</p>

<DESC>This is an advanced notification from the USAID Mission in Kosovo in anticipation of a Request for Proposals for a Contract Law Enforcement (CLE) Program. &nbsp;A draft Statement of Work is attached to provide you with more information on and to make comments, if any, on the upcoming CLE Program.
<p>The goal of the CLE Program is to implement activities which focus on improving the rule of law structures to lead to a better environment for economic growth and increased investment. The Program will aim to improve the overall contract and commercial law framework. It will do this by improving the quality of professionals focusing on contract and commercial law issues such as judges, lawyers and other legal professionals including jurists working for the business community.

<SUBJECT>Y--East Branch Cutoff Wall Presentation Invitation
<SOLNBR>EASTBRANCHCUTOFFWALL
<CONTACT>Jeffrey Zbezinski, 412-395-7228

<a href="mailto:jeffrey.j.zbezinski@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Pittsburgh</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to seek parties interested in presenting their capabilities for construction of deep cutoff walls to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, for the project at East Branch Dam, Wilcox, PA.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Only Contractors that have relevant experience constructing cutoff walls (to the depths and in the conditions described below) using hydro-cutter, top drive drill, or similar equipment may make presentations to the Pittsburgh District.  Due to the projected scope of cutoff wall construction, an interested offeror shall have a contract bonding capacity of $100 to $250 million. These requirements do not preclude other Contractors from submitting proposals when the solicitation for cutoff wall construction is released.   East Branch Dam is located on the East Branch Clarion River, 7.3 miles upstream of its confluence with the West Branch Clarion River at Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania. <br> <br>The primary component of the construction consists of a concrete cutoff wall constructed through the dam and abutments to an anticipated maximum depth of 260 feet, including an anticipated maximum depth of 170 feet into bedrock.  The wall element thickness will be sufficient to achieve a minimum continuous thickness of 18 inches.  East Branch dam is a compacted earth embankment composed of silt, sand, gravel and contains cobbles and some boulders.  The dam underwent a serious internal erosion event in 1957.   The subsequent repair was incomplete, leaving the dam especially susceptible to additional internal erosion events.  The dam is fragile in the area of this repair as well as generally susceptible to hydrofracture.  Pretreatment by soil-cement mixing will be necessary in the particularly fragile portion of the embankment associated with the 1957 grouted void repair to lessen the risk that cutoff wall construction by the slurry-filled panel method will further damage the dam.  The maximum depth of soil mixing is approximately 150 feet. Based on the best currently available information, the foundation soils have the same general composition as the embankment materials, although they contain more boulders.  Attachment 1 includes photographs of typical foundation soils.  Zones of more permeable and water-bearing gravels are present in the foundation soils. <br> <br>Bedrock is composed primarily of sandstone and shale, although zones of siltstone, limestone and conglomerate are present less frequently.  Unconfined compressive strengths in excess of 20,000 psi are not uncommon within the bedrock. Typical bedrock strength properties obtained during recent explorations at East Branch are summarized in Attachment 2.  The bedrock contains sufficiently permeable zones that pre-grouting will be necessary to permit cutoff wall construction without rapid loss of slurry.   Bedrock is fractured in select zones, particularly near the top of rock, with observed Lugeon Values ranging from zero to in excess of 200 (i.e. water pressure could not be developed at the pumped flowrate).  Two Optical Televiwer Images from a recent exploration, including Lugeon testing results and water losses observed during coring, are shown in Attachment 3.  These images indicate typical bedrock conditions, including the the variability of bedrock conditions between the left abutment and valley center.  <br><br>Interested Contractors shall respond to this request no later than February 17, 2012.  All interested Contractors must be registered in CCR to be eligible for award of Government contracts.  To reserve a time and date to make a presentation, submit a one page corporate fact sheet to Jeff Zbezinski, Contract Specialist at the following e-mail address:  jeffrey.j.zbezinski@usace.army.mil.  This fact sheet will be used to verify that Contractors meet the construction and bonding capabilities described previously.  Presentations will be entertained at the Pittsburgh District Offices, US Army Corps of Engineers, 1000 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 from March 19-23, 2012 between the hours of 9:00 am and 3:00 pm.  Presentations shall be limited to a window of two (2)-hours, to include follow-up questions.  The government will provide a projector.<br>  <br>Interested offerors shall provide an electronic copy of their presentation to the Pittsburgh District on a CD or DVD ROM at the presentation session.  Contractors shall also provide 10 hard copies of their presentations to the Pittsburgh District.  After all the presentations are conducted, a complete list of prospective offerors that made presentations will be posted to this announcement, along with questions and responses provided by the Government.  Information provided by a potential offeror will not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the potential offeror's confidential business strategy. <br><br>Contracting Office Address:<br>USACE District, Pittsburgh, 1000 Liberty Avenue, W.S.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Casting Padding. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements.<strong> The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is October 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br /><br /><strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Robert</strong> <strong>Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil 011-49-6221-172109 and Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil 011-49-6221-172106.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Casting Tape. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $280,986.53. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, thirty-nine (39) of the total sixty-two (62) line items represent the top eight (8) products and account for 90.75% ($254,299.89) of the total volume in sales $280,986.53 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Rob Halliday, Clinical Analyst, at robert.halliday@us.army.mil and Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil. </strong>The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO Europe via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor, who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO Europe reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.<br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. <br /></strong>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Casting Padding products.<br />a. This product line, Casting Padding, includes latex-free/safe cotton, sterile and non-sterile items in a variety of sizes to include at a minimum the specific products listed.<br />1) Cotton padding non-sterile 6 inches x 4 yards<br />2) Cotton padding non-sterile 4 inches x 4 yards<br />3) Cotton padding non-sterile 3 inches x 4 yards<br />4) Cotton padding non-sterile 2 inches x 4 yards<br />5) Cotton padding sterile 4 inches x 4 yards<br />6) Cotton padding sterile 2 inches x 4 yards<br />7) Cotton padding sterile 6 inches x 4 yards<br />8) Cotton padding sterile 3 inches x 4 yards<br />*Operational usage items are included in this list of Casting Padding.<br />b. Vendor must provide a complete itemized list of products supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFIAQ. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes. <br />2. Vendors must provide supporting documentation that all products meet the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) manufacturing of Orthopedic, Prosthetic, Surgical Appliances and Supplies used in manufacturing Casting Padding.<br />3. Vendor must have or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Casting Padding. Vendor must provide the DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number has been applied for.<br />4. Vendor must have or be in the process of applying for agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Casting Padding, or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements.<br />5. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative when pricing is requested in Phase III. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for all MMESO AORs. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for all products will be disqualified.<br />6. Vendor must indicate country from which each line item is an end product, IAW Trade Agreements Act and provide date last updated in the DAPA Management System. Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System. Vendors not compliant IAW Trade Agreements Act will be disqualified.<br />7. Vendor is advised that the Berry Amendment may apply to this SA, subject to the June 13, 2001 "Class Determination of Domestic Non-Availability for Defense Supply Center Philadelphia Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Programs".</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance Evaluation<br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Europe, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs.<strong> Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation in Phase II. Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00 PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO Europe verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. Twenty four (24) rolls/each cotton sterile Casting Padding listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.<br />1) Cotton padding sterile 6 inches x 4 yards, 24 rolls<br />2) Cotton padding sterile 3 inches x 4 yards, 24 rolls</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical/performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twenty-one (21) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements<br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. NPSG 14.01.01 and Material Performance - The cast padding readily tears allowing uniform padding application. The padding must tear readily and evenly, so as to aid the uniform molding process and prevent any unnecessary pressure against the patient's skin or bony prominences which could cause skin breakdown. <br />2. NPSG 14.01.01 and Material Performance - The cast padding readily molds for a uniform application over body contours. The padding must provide uniform molding so that it does not put unnecessary pressure against the patient's skin or bony prominences that could cause skin breakdown.<br /><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></span> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

A vendor, who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO Europe reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.<br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>

This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One (1) box of each fiberglass/synthetic casting tape listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.<br />1) Cast tape fiberglass/synthetic 2 inches wide by 4 yards long, white - 1 box of 10 to 12 tapes<br />2) Cast tape fiberglass/synthetic 4 inches wide by 4 yards long, white - 1 box of 10 to 12 tapes</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical/performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twenty-one (21) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements<br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below.<br />1. OSHA guidelines for the manufacturing of Orthopedic, Prosthetic, Surgical Appliances and Supplies/ Product Performance - During application, the cast tape rolls uniformly with the peg remaining central on the roll. The cast tape must be made of materials which allow the tape roll to remain intact for uniformity and consistent handling during application.<br />2. Joint Commission IC 02.02.01 - The casting tape conforms over the contours of the affected body part. The casting tape must conform over difficult anatomical contours preventing tissue pressure points. Pressure points may cause skin or tissue breakdown causing a skin or tissue infection.<br />3. ASTM Standard F1536 - 95, 2010 - The casting tape material allows for vendor indicated set times. The cast tape material must set quickly to ensure the casted limb is stabilized in the desired position.<br />4. Patient Safety - The cast has a smooth finish, is non-abrasive, and will not snag on clothing. The cast must be smooth or non-abrasive and not snag on clothing in order to prevent any injury to the patient or patient clothing.<br /><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs.<strong> Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></span> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Casting Splints. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best price for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR). It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. Vendor is not required to quote for each MMESO AOR. <strong>The Government will make a single selection for each of the following MMESO AORs:</strong>
<p><strong>1. MMESO North</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. MMESO South</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. MMESO West</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. MMESO Pacific</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. MMESO Europe<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is October 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. <br /><br /><strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil<br />011-49-6221-172109, and Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil 011-49-6221-172106.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Casting Splints. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $687,099.59. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, thirty three (33) of the total seventy one (71) line items represent the top eight (8) products and account for 79.04% ($543,037.71) of the total volume in sales $687,099.59 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. <strong>Estimated annual demand per Area of Responsibility is approximately MMESO North $136,466.13, MMESO South $204,302.45, MMESO West $165,749.73, MMESO Europe $118,913.62, and MMESO Pacific $61,667.66.</strong> The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Rob Halliday, Clinical Analyst, at robert.halliday@us.army.mil and Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO Europe via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor, who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. </strong>The MMESO Europe reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements.

The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical/performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twenty-one (21) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance acceptability requirements outlined below. <br />1.

ASTM Standard F1536 - 95, 2010 - The splint material allows for vendor indicated set times. The splint material must set quickly, according to vendor specifications, to ensure the splinted limb is stabilized in the desired position.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. <strong>A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement. Pricing should be provided for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted based on a committed volume of 80% of the total volume in sales of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. Vendor quotes will contain separate pricing for each MMESO AOR(s) for which a quote is submitted based on Technical / Company Requirements above. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. <strong>Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise.</strong> Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that are determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected for each MMESO AOR.</strong></p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance shall be from May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013.</p>

Solicitation number<br />2. Closing Date: April 17, 2012 at 3:00 pm CST<br />3. Name, address and telephone number of company and email address of contact person.<br />4. Technical description of the item/service being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements of the solicitation.

"Remit to" address, if different from mailing address<br />8.

Past performance information, when included as a "best value" factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant <br />information).</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (January 1999). The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and the following "best value" factors considered. (1) Past Performance - the government reserves the right to conduct their own investigation other than the contractor's provided list (2) Ability to meet the requirements and qualifications in the statement of work. (3) Response to the technical evaluation factors. <strong>THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF, OR SUBMIT A WRITTEN RESPONSE TO, THE ATTACHED TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS. </strong>The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the service in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a purchase order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the services to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among quotes with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria.<strong> The evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to price.</strong></p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (February 2012). See attachment for full text and instructions for completion.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (February 2012), applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference.</p>

<p>Contractor's intending to conduct business with the Federal Government must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award. The CCR is the primary Government repository, which retains information on Government contractors. You may register via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling (888) 227-2423 or (269) 961-5757.</p>
<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation AG-6633-S-12-0010 is issued as a request for proposals (RFP's). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27.
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), North Dakota State Office intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) to small business sources capable of providing abstract, title commitment and filing services for conservation easements. A BPA is a method of filling anticipated repetitive needs. It is not a contract. The Government is not obligated to place any call orders nor is the vendor obligated to accept any orders. For each work assignment, the Government will request title services through the issuance of a BPA call order from those firms that have been awarded a BPA. Individual call orders shall be submitted in accordance with the terms agreed to in the BPA. Government personnel authorized to place call orders under the BPA will be identified on the BPA by name and telephone number. The contractor will be expected to furnish the service in accordance with the terms and conditions of the BPA, without the need for additional paperwork beyond the Statement of Work that accompanies the order.</p>
<p>Updating and/or developing abstracts, issuing title commitment and filing of easement documents will be for conservation easements located throughout the State of North Dakota. The contractor shall furnish all services, including obtaining title insurance from a title company approved by the U.S. Attorney General. The contractor will perform the same services as a commercial transaction, including updating of existing abstracts, creating abstracts (as deemed necessary), preparing preliminary and final title commitments, obtaining deeds and completion of any necessary curative instruments to assure merchantable title to the conservation easement. The Statement of Work is attached to this solicitation. Timely delivery of complete and accurate abstract and title commitments is crucial to the success of NRCS programs. Call order completion dates will vary depending on the phase of services provided. Obtaining abstracts from landowners may take additional time which, in turn, will affect completion of the updates and issuance of the preliminary title policy. However, time is of the essence for easement closure and recording. Timeframes may fluctuate and will be closely monitored by the contractor and the Contracting Officer.</p>

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:

(i) Technical capability of the item quoted to meet the Government requirement
(ii) Customer responsiveness
(iii) Price

Technical capability and customer responsiveness will both be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. A quote that is considered technically unacceptable or a quoter that is determined to have inadequate customer responsiveness shall be ineligible for award. Customer responsiveness will be assessed based on past dealings between the quoter and the customer - Naval Submarine Base Point Loma. If the quoter has never dealt with this customer before, they will be considered to have adequate customer responsiveness for award purposes.

<DESC><p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>OTI's Field Programs Division (FPD) develops, oversees, and manages OTI country programs and field staff that includes all programming responsibilities and authorities, and start-up and close out of OTI country programs. FPD staff regularly engage with counterparts in USAID Missions overseas, Regional Bureaus, Department of State, and other offices engaged in country development issues. The FPD provides expertise and technical support for country programs and USAID Missions, and represents OTI in intra/inter-agency sector-specific dialog and debate.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Regional Team Leader manages one of DCHA/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, D.C. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Asia, Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Regional Team Leader's principal responsibility will be the oversight and management of specific DCHA/OTI country programs in one of OTI's three geographic regions. Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader is initially expected to manage the Asia or Middle East teams. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus the vast majority of time on country program implementation. The objectives for this position are to (1) ensure USAID/DCHA/OTI's regional team is managed effectively in Washington and the field (effectively manage and supervise OTI Program Manager staff in Washington, and OTI Country Representatives in the field), and (2) ensure US government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practice, and USG policy.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to fund and employ a Regional Team Leader to support USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI).</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Regional Team Leader requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Regional Team Leader requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Regional Team Leader is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Regional Team Leader is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Regional Team Leader has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Regional Team Leader is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The incumbent serves as OTI's principal expert on country program issues related to the region of assignment. A majority of the duties listed below are related to management and supervision of program funded personal, and the development, oversight, and management of OTI's country programs. It is important that the Regional Team Leader quickly familiarize her/himself in the key tasks of the country team members in order to ensure that primary tasks are carried out appropriately and efficiently.</p>
<p>The Regional Team Leader's duties will include but not be limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Lead and manage the Regional Team in Washington headquarters, including the management and supervision of Program Manager staff in Washington and Country Representatives in the field, as well as Implementing Partner grants and agreements at the headquarter level. (Note that OTI Country Representatives in the field directly supervise additional field staff, and responsibility for managing implementing partners at the headquarter level may be delegated to trained Program Manager staff in Washington.);</p>
<p>&bull; Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives, ensure staff work objectives and tasks are well defined, and ensure recruitment is initiated immediately when staffing needs arise. Ensure staff are highly qualified and trained and mentored in all critical aspects of OTI operations and programming. Ensure employee performance evaluations are completed in a timely manner in accordance with OTI office policy;</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiate, oversee and manage the overall Regional Team country budgets and ensure the Regional Team procurement plan is kept up to date. It is critical to ensure that country programs are appropriately budgeted for. Additional responsibilities include working to secure additional funding from other USG sources if required, and ensuring that the team is trained on all the appropriate systems and tools for budgeting, finances and procurement;</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design, in close coordination with lower and higher-ranking USAID and other U.S. Government officials, OTI country program strategies and determine appropriate USAID funding levels and requirements;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee the design and implementation of new country program operations to include complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries, including the effective oversight of management, logistical, budget, administrative, human resources, and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull; Supervise the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives, including overseeing and/or managing the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and Personal Service Contract employees;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee and ensure the development of documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with NGOs, international donors, Department of State and other USG agencies and others interested in particular OTI country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate and communicate with other DCHA, USAID, State Department, Department of Defense and other U.S. Government agency personnel in Washington and the field; cooperating country Government officials; United Nations organizations; the World Bank; and host country and international NGOs;</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor and evaluate OTI country programs through regular communication with the OTI program staff and implementing partner headquarter staff, the regular review of reports from the field and Washington, liaising with the OTI Program Office team, and regular field site visits;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that field programs are provided support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee, develop and/or manage, in conjunction with the OTI Washington staff and OTI country representative in the field, an OTI close-out strategy that will, wherever appropriate and possible, ensure reasonable and effective hand-over to follow-on USAID and/or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a central participant on inter- and intra-agency policy and crisis task forces when required;</p>
<p>&bull; Disseminate regular DCHA/OTI reports to U.S. Government and non-U.S. Government agencies and organizations as deemed appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting Chief of Field Programs Division, or Country Representative in the field in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor other OTI Team Leaders, and mentor and train Country Representatives and Program Managers as required; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Regional Team Leader will take direction from and will report to the Chief, Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>

<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams, Country Start-Ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Assessments, Country Start-ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>The OTI program in Libya will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government and as appropriate any future State Department and USAID presence in Libya. In particular, the OTI program will provide assistance to support the nascent political transition in Libya. In close coordination with State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia-Middle East (AME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in Tripoli, Libya. This post is not a family-accompanied post and does not allow minor or adult dependents, although a separate maintenance allowance will be authorized for incumbents with dependents.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull; Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in the monitoring and evaluation of OTI-sponsored activities;</p>
<p>&bull; If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; As appropriate, communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the US Embassy, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants, and drivers; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will report to OTI's Country Representative in the designated country.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in Libya, the work is generally performed in an office environment.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.

<p>Background<br />ASPR provides emergency medical care to the victims of public health emergencies and catastrophic events that overwhelm the capacity of state and local emergency medical systems to respond to these disasters. ASPR currently has teams located across the nation that are prepared to deploy within hours to respond to an all hazards environment. ASPR has positioned pharmaceutical caches/kits at various locations around the Continental United States, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii.

Medical caches for National Veterinarian Response Teams are located within the warehouses of ASPR. <br />Purpose<br />The purpose of this contract is to establish a contract that allows The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/ASPR/OPEO to readily replenish its supplies as needed when responding to disasters (during response) and when in steady state. During a disaster, ASPR requires additional dental and veterinary supplies for purposes of re-supplying caches/kits. The exact, dental, and/ or veterinary supplies, quantities and delivery requirements are not known in advance and may vary considerably for re-supply. The resulting contract provides for preparedness operations field re-supply of, dental, and/or veterinary supplies in the disaster-affected regions.</p>

<p>Closing date for receipt of quotations is May 17, 2012, 3:00 P.M. EST. Submit to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, MRS Product Line, Elizabeth City, NC, ATTN; Denise Coley, (252) 335-6562, denise.m.coley@uscg.mil. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables.<br />"Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000" means-<br />(1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and<br />(2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules).<br />"Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />(b) The offeror [_] has [_] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000.<br />(c) If the offeror checked "has" in paragraph (b) of this provision, the offeror represents, by submission of this offer, that the information it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and complete as of the date of submission of this offer with regard to the following information:<br />(1) Whether the offeror, and/or any of its principals, has or has not, within the last five years, in connection with the award to or performance by the offeror of a Federal contract or grant, been the subject of a proceeding, at the Federal or State level that resulted in any of the following dispositions: <br />(i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction.<br />(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more.<br />(iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in-<br />(A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or <br />(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000.<br />(iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision.<br />(2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence.<br />(d) The offeror shall post the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database via https://www.acquisition.gov (see 52.204-7).<br />(End of provision)<br />Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation 3052.209-70 <br />Prohibition on contracts with corporate expatriates (JUN 2006)<br />(a) Prohibitions.<br />Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.

<DESC>Following is additional information:
<p><br />1. Section 3.1: What is meant by "data connectivity" Does the Government mean for the contractor to host?</p>
<p>Yes, the contractor should host.</p>
<p>2. Section 3.2: What is meant by "program"? Does it refer to a) the development tool and/or platform used to deliver the distance learning product OR b) the curriculi for the different languages OR c) both?</p>
<p>The "program" refers to the platform and the eMentors (instructors). Upon contract start LEAP managers and Curriculum Development team will work with the contractor to develop curriculum</p>
<p>Section 3.2: How many of the languages provided and which ones would be used to start the distance learning product?</p>
<p>The contractor should be able to provide any and all of the languages upon LEAP request.</p>
<p>3. Section 4.1 states "The eMentors will be expected to work closely/collaborate with the LEAP Program Office to create/develop specific curriculum as well as translation of materials provided by the LEAP Program Office." 1.) Will the LEAP office provide all materials? Or Does the contractor develop curriculum for each target language? 2.) What is the expected/anticipated length per lesson? 3.) What is the expected/anticipated breakdown of interactivity level for the course? (i.e.: 10% level 1, 40% level 2, and 50% level 3 IMI) 4.) Is the contractor expected to develop instructor materials in support of the cohort? (i.e.: instructor/student guides, instructor scripts, student handouts, etc.)5.) would these materials have to be in both English and target language?</p>
<p>The curriculum for LEAP will come from guidelines provided (in English) to the contractor from LEAP managers. The eMentors will create curriculum in their own particular language based on these guidelines. LEAP will also provide actual material to the contractor for translation and presentation to LEAP participants. Materials such as textbooks, dictionaries, etc (if<br />used) will be provided by the contractor.</p>
<p>Currently, participants who are available for eMentor courses are expected to participant three to five hours a week. LEAP managers are in the process of developing a structured academic plan for LEAP participants, to include adjusting the hours per year necessary for participants at various levels.<br />It is expected that the more advanced a participant is, the less time he or she will be in classes each year.</p>
<p>Classes are expected to be highly interactive at all levels. This is why the classes should be capped at 6 participants, the less participants per class, the more each participant can contribute.</p>
<p>The contractor is expected to develop instructor and participant support materials. Syllabi should be provided to LEAP managers in English but actual classroom materials such as Powerpoint presentations need not be provided in English.</p>
<p>4. Is the product expected to be &sect;508-compliant? If so to what level?</p>
<p>Yes. http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=stdsSum</p>
<p>5. What LMS, if any is currently in use by the LEAP office?</p>
<p>LEAP has used several language providers to date using a variety of LMS. These vendors have used Elluminate, Adobe Connect, and the Special Operations Forces Teletraining System</p>
<p>6. Are mobile and streaming also required? Would it be viewed negatively if they were also included in the response.</p>
<p>It is expected that certain LEAP participants will choose to participate with mobile devices. Mobile and streaming will not be viewed negatively if included in the response.</p>
<p>7. Could you tell us more about the audience?</p>
<p>LEAP participants are officers and select enlisted members of the Active Duty Air Force. They are General Purpose Force (GPF) Airmen who are NOT linguists or language professionals by trade. They are part of a corps group of Airmen who are being developed to communicate in one or more foreign languages in order to fill language-coded billets and/or be called upon for those contingency operations or deployments requiring language skills. LEAP participants must have existing foreign language capabilities before acceptance into the program.</p>
<p>a. Average number of years in service? Enlisted or Officer, Rank?</p>
<p>As a new program, LEAP is targeting younger officers. Most LEAP officers are currently Captains or below with ten or less years in service, although there are Majors, Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels in LEAP. However, LEAP is a career-long program and so the ranks are expected to increase as the LEAP participants progress through their careers.</p>
<p>LEAP has only recently opened the program to select enlisted members. We are targeting enlisted members with three to 16 years of service. Most enlisted LEAP members are between the ranks of Staff and Master Sergeant.</p>
<p>b. Pre-requisite: 1.) What ILR level will they have achieved? We assume a level II or level III ILR proficiency in the target language. 2.) What competency 2/ 2+/3+ reading listening speaking?</p>
<p>Please see paragraph 4.3 to see what ILR levels LEAP participants are expected to attain in their foreign language(s) while in LEAP. To apply, participants must demonstrate some proficiency in a foreign language, but this varies according to language and rank. Those of lower ranks, such as cadets, are not expected to have as high of a proficiency when they apply than those of higher rank, such as Majors.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: <br>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Warfighter Protection and Aerial Delivery Directorate (WARPAD) intends to award a sole source fixed price purchase order under simplified acquisition procedures to CREATIVE APPAREL ASSOCIATES, LLC, 318 AUGUSTA RD, Belmont, ME, 04952-3015, for one hundred (100) Female Outer Tactical Vests, as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253, as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This is being done in order to maintain that the design is not prematurely leaked to industry, the need to fabricate carriers with a company who is not a current sub-contractor or prime vendor with current IOTV production is imperative.  Any action that is taken to remove or overcome any barrier to competition could have serious repercussions on the female version IOTV development and could jeopardize the Government's ability to compete a FOTV design under the IOTV ID/IQ contract in place with RDECOMAC. <br>The proposed contract action is for supplies which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This notice of intent to purchase supplies from only one source is not a request for proposals; however interested persons may submit their capability to respond to this requirement to the point of contact listed below by May 29, 2012.<br>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>ACC-APG-CCAP-SCN-Ft Detrick<br><br>Point of Contact(s): <br>Sarah Sun: sarah.a.sun@us.army.mil<br><br>

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command- White Sands Office, has a requirement for Test Engineering and Analysis Support Services (TEAS) at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico. Therefore, White Sands Missile Range will be hosting a one (1) day only Industry Day for the follow-on Test Engineering and Analysis Support Services contract currently held by ATAMIR-WSMR LLC and invites you to attend.
<p>Location: WSMR Professional Development Center auditorium, Building 465, Dyer Street, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, 88002. Parking is available near the intersection of Dyer Street and Rock Island Avenue and also at Dyer Street and Picatinny Avenue.</p>
<p>Time: The event will begin at 08:00 AM on 11 April 2012. Attendees should plan on arriving to WSMR at least one and one half (1.5) hours prior to the event so you may process through security, obtain a visitor's pass and check-in at the event. Check-in at the event will begin at 7:30 AM MST. A tentative agenda is attached.</p>
<p>All questions will be held until the afternoon session. All questions and answers discussed at the Industry Day event will be published.</p>
<p>RSVP: Contractors electing to attend the Industry Day must RSVP to Mr. Peter L. Hopkins, Contracting Officer. There is a limit of two (2) representatives per contractor. No foreign nationals are permitted. The contractor must e-mail the completed attached RSVP form (see attached Microsoft Excel workbook) to peter.l.hopkins.civ@mail.mil by COB 4 April 2012. Due to security procedures, the persons attending the Industry Day must be listed on the RSVP form.</p>
<p>Las Cruces, NM is the closest city to WSMR, NM. The closest WSMR access gate is located off of US Highway 70. El Paso International Airport, El Paso, TX is the closest regional airport. Contractors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with their attendance at the Industry Day. Please visit the WSMR website, http://www.wsmr.army.mil/Pages/Home.aspx, for more information about WSMR. The "WSMR at a Glance 2011" and the WSMR Fact-book" are also attached for your basic information. Maps of WSMR are available at:<br />http://www.wsmr.army.mil/testcenter/Pages/WhereWeAre.aspx.</p>
<p>Occasionally, WSMR will block roads (including US Highway 70) in the area for missile testing. Please call the Road Block phone number, 575-678-1178, for recorded updates on planned roadblocks. The information is usually updated each weekday in the afternoon for the following day. Since the actual firing schedule can slide due to any number of circumstances like weather or equipment problems, travelers should also check the recording right before leaving to ensure nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Installation Access: All visitors must bring photo identification. To obtain a vehicle security pass you must have a driver's license, vehicle registration and proof of insurance. All visitors must enter WSMR through the Las Cruces main gate (located off of US Highway 70). Visitors must stop at the WSMR Reception Center to obtain their visitor's pass.</p>
<p>Safety: As a tri-service Department of Defense Range, White Sands has tested nearly every type of deployable ordnance developed in the United States since 1945. Quite a number of these munitions were deliberately designed to blend in with the terrain, and their presence may not be immediately obvious to the casual observer. Consequently, even though WSMR performs extensive Range Clearance activities, there is no assurance that any area of the Range is truly 100% free of unexploded ordnance. More information concerning unexploded ordnance hazards can be viewed at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/ux/Pages/default.aspx. The contractors are responsible to view the video found at this link under the title, UXO Hazards Video. You will be asked to sign a form, acknowledging that you have viewed this video at the check-in event. No person will be allowed to tour the range without first viewing this video.</p>
<p>Photography &amp; Video Ban: No photographs or videos are allowed on WSMR except in the WSMR museum missile park area.</p>
<p>A DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) without the Technical Exhibits has been provided for industry review and is subject to change prior to its official release. This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The purpose of this notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described within the attached DRAFT PWS. Please note that the Technical Exhibits will not be provided at this time.</p>

<p>2. Describe proposed methods and metrics for contract surveillance in relation to your preferred contract type;</p>
<p>3. Identify the subcontracting opportunities that may exist for the contemplated services.

<p>4. Please identify a suitable phase-in period.</p>
<p>5. Please identify any potential organizational conflicts of interest.</p>

The information obtained from this RFI will be utilized as market research for consideration in development of the Acquisition Strategy and Acquisition Plan for this requirement.

<DESC>Title:  Herbicide Application via Helicopter at the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Suffolk (Suffolk Co.), Virginia

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (U.S.F.W.S.) has a requirement for aerial application via helicopter of herbicides to control and eradicate target species Phragmites australis in the footprint of the Lateral West Wildfire, which burned 6,377 acres at the Great Dismal Swamp NWR in August, 2011. This contract will provide control of Phragmites in an area covering approximately 1,395 acres.
The work under this contract consists of furnishing all necessary equipment, labor and materials necessary to accomplish the specified vegetative control and eradication. Contractor shall furnish necessary herbicide and surfactant. The herbicide applications will consist of two separate spray missions: 1) to apply a combination of glyphosate and imazapyr products to all phragmites australis populations identified for treatment; and 2) a late season survey and clean up spray to apply imazapyr product to surviving clones of Phragmites. The contractor performing the spraying work must have on-board GPS (AgNav system). The contractor will be provided with spatial data (shapefiles) indicating the areas to be sprayed. 
Insurance:  The contractor will carry liability insurance that will cover the application of pesticides as defined in the specifications.

A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br /><br />The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) serves as the lead agency for the National Children's Study (NCS or Study), a longitudinal cohort study that will examine the effects of environmental influences on the health and development of approximately 100,000 children. Additional background about the Study is available on the Study's Website (www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov)<br /><br />The NICHD intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, follow-on contracts with 17 of the current Wave I NCS Study Center contractors identified below for a period of 6 months the purpose of which is to the continue limited NCS activities beyond their September 27, 2012 contract completion dates. The contracts will be awarded under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) and HHSAR 306.302-1(a)(2)(iv). <br /><br />WAVE I STUDY CENTER (CONTRACTOR) - LOCATION (COUNTY)<br />1. University of California, Irvine -&nbsp;San Diego, CA<br />2. University of New Mexico - Valencia, NM<br />3. St. Louis University - St Louis, MO<br />4. University of Hawaii - Honolulu, HI<br />5. Northwestern University - Cook, IL<br />6. University of California, Los Angeles - Los Angeles, CA<br />7. University of Minnesota - Ramsey, MN<br />8. University of Pittsburgh - Westmorland, PA<br />9.&nbsp;University of Utah - Cache, UT<br />10. Brown University - Providence, RI<br />11. University of California, Davis - Sacramento, CA<br />12. University of Texas, San Antonio - Bexar, TX<br />13. Yale University - New Haven, CT<br />14. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia - Schuylkill, PA<br />15. Michigan State University - Wayne, MI<br />16. University of Mississippi - Hinds, MS<br />17. University of North Carolina - Durham, NC</p>
<p>For the period of September 28, 2012 - March 29, 2013 contractors will ensure they have the staff and facilities sufficient to conduct the following activities:<br /><br />&bull; Complete the development and implementation of a Transition Plan that is sufficiently detailed to ensure an efficient and complete transition of Study responsibilities to a possible successor preventing any disruption in Study visits, data collection, data transfer, or other research activities.<br />&bull; Continue Study-related data collections that may take place in the home, in the community, by telephone, other remote setting or in a clinical or specific Study setting. <br />&bull; Transmit Operational and Study data to the NCS-Program Office according to the Study specifications.<br />&bull; Track receipt of self-administered forms and enter this hard copy data into their approved electronic format for transmission to the NCS Vanguard Data Repository (VDR). <br />&bull; Ensure compliance with ongoing quality control procedures described in the Study Protocol and in the study procedural manual. <br />&bull; Comply with all Institutional Review Board (IRB), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements.<br />&bull; Meet via phone and/or face-to-face with the Contracting Officer Representative(s) and other staff to review progress and anticipated or existing problems.<br />&bull; Adhere to the policies of the NCS Publications Committee and the Data Access Committee.</p>
<p>Under the existing contracts the Wave I Study Centers in their respective locations (counties) have recruited, tracked, retained and collected data on a cohort of participants. They have conducted home visits to collect biospecimens, environmental samples, and other analytical materials. The primary goal of these follow-on contracts is to retain the current participants; conduct limited data collection, and prepare for the transition of all NCS activities to a successor contractor. Given those objectives, the extent of contractor activities, data rights restrictions, and other pertinent factors, there is no reasonable expectation that another contractor(s) could assume the activities of these centers for a period of 6 months. In addition, transfer of the personally identifiable information (PII) being safeguarded by the existing contractors cannot be released to another prospective contractor without proper authorization, a lengthy process that could result in unacceptable delays to current Study requirements.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal. However, if any responsible source believes it can perform the above requirements they may submit three (3) copies of their capability statement for consideration by the NICHD to Howard O. Cyrus Jr., Contracting Officer, NICHD Office of Acquisitions, Contract Management Branch, 6100 Executive Blvd., Bethesda, MD 20892-7510. Phone number 301-435-6963; email hc163b@nih.gov All responses must be received in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NICHD Contracting Office and the NCS Program Office to make a determination that the party can or cannot perform this requirement. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The term "Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics" (ADP) refers generally to this application of automated monitoring, condition prognosis, and incipient failure detection. ADP includes applications to mechanical and electrical equipment. It also includes self testing of digital systems, including calibration verification for digital system (I/O) interfaces. Properly designed and implemented, ADP can clearly benefit the safe and reliable operation of a fuel cycle facility or nuclear power plant. But it is also possible for failure or incorrect operation of ADP resources to inhibit proper operation. In addition, the implementation of ADP involves the addition of equipment and software, and tends to make systems more complicated. Added complexity, unfortunately, brings with it an increased potential for hidden or unanticipated couplings and dependencies, and ultimately the possibility of an increased likelihood of failure. The tasks under this contract will provide technical guidance, regulatory-based acceptance criteria, and recommendations for tools and methodologies (TM) to support regulatory evaluation of proposed applications of ADP. These tasks also include assistance to NRC staff in preparing review processes and inspection procedures. The results of this work may result in improved NRC regulatory guidance on safety system network designs.<br /><br />Please see attached request for proposal.

Proposals should present in the Sample Staffing Plan and the Sample Cost Control Plan specific responses to the requirement to increase Iraqi personnel on the contract and to buy from local suppliers as practicable (see L.16.1.3.1 and L.16.1.10). <br /><br />Also, the Solicitiation requires a percentage of local Iraqi hires that the Offeror is committed to hire. This may be presented as a transition plan over time (M.10.1.2.1). These numbers will become part of the contract after award, and plans to implement and carry-out the hiring of locals will be tracked in quarterly Program Reviews.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; The United States Government seeks to lease approximately&nbsp;4,540 ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet of contiguous office space in Milledgeville, GA. The lease term is for ten (10) years, five (5) years firm. The government reserves the right to consider only existing buildings, and not new construction, in this procurement.
<p>The space must be located within the area delineated by the following boundaries:</p>
<p>&bull; North: Dunlap Road<br />&bull; South: Franklin Street<br />&bull; East: Elbert Street<br />&bull; West: Hwy 441/bypass</p>
<p>The following criteria shall apply to all space considered by the Government:<br />&bull; The space must have easy access to available parking for visitors and employees.<br />&bull; The space should not be located within the immediate vicinity of railroad tracks.<br />&bull; Sites which are located directly on a highway or six-lane thoroughfare shall not be considered in the following instances:<br />o The two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within a block;<br />o The location access is directly from a highway, unless there is a traffic control device within two blocks or equivalent from the proposed office space.<br />&bull; To allow for visibility to the public, this agency's office space shall be located not more than the equivalent of two city blocks from a primary or secondary street serving the office. As an alternative to direct visibility, the lessor shall provide acceptable signage from the primary or secondary street at no additional cost. The route from the primary or secondary street shall be direct. Locations which have obscure, difficult access or which require additional turns shall not be considered.</p>
<p>The Government prefers street-level, contiguous (same floor). Contiguous upper floor space on one floor which meets GSA lease criteria and has handicapped accessible elevator service to the government office floor is an acceptable alternative. It is preferred that the storage and/or multipurpose rooms are located contiguous with the main office space. However, these rooms only, and their associated square footage, may be separated from the main office area by a public corridor.

SOLICITATION VA261-12-R-0033, DESIGN OF OPERATION SUITE

Following are questions with VA responses:

Please clarify how many operating rooms are required to be open at all times during phased and sub-phased construction.
RESPONSE - Number of rooms to remain open would be finalized with the Operating Rooms staff prior to beginning design.
 
Would the VA be able to share the previously prepared volume/flow analysis prior to this submission, or, alternatively, would it be shared with the design teams selected for interview?
RESPONSE - This information will not be shared at this point.  It may be shared with those firms chosen for interviews.
 
It was indicated that the volume/flow analysis determined that the OR suite is understaffed by 12.  Is that for the current 8 OR/Procedure rooms or the projected 10 ORs expected for the final redesign?
RESPONSE - Reference to being understaffed by 12 refers to operating the current 8 OR suites.
 
Would the VA be able to share the previously prepared feasibility report prior to this submission, or, alternatively, would it be shared with the design teams selected for interview?
RESPONSE - This information will not be shared at this point.  It may be shared with those firms chosen for interviews.

As this is primarily a remodeling/renovation project, is there a need/request for civil engineering design services?
RESPONSE - There will not be a need for a Civil Engineer.  Offerors do not need to include a Civil Engineer with the submission.

Who did the feasibility study and Med Model simulation related to this project, and are they precluded from submitting on this solicitation?
RESPONSE - Design Partnership performed the Med Model simulation.  They are excluded from submitting as a Prime AE firm.

Would you please confirm if relocation of the lab space is, or is not, part of the scope of work to make way for Phase 1?
RESPONSE - Relocation of the lab space is not part of this work.  However, demolition of the space in preparation for OR renovation is.

Are the subcontracting goal percentages defined in the solicitation guidelines/recommendations/minimum requirements? Do those exact percentages need to be met for a large business to be considered for award?
RESPONSE - Subcontracting percentages are goals.  If a large business is chosen for award it will have to show, as part of the proposal, efforts made to achieve these goals.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Strategic Technology Office (STO), issued Broad Agency Announcement No. DARPA-BAA-11-51 titled, "Content-Based Mobile Edge Networking," on 26 April 2011. The BAA solicited innovative research proposals in the areas of content distribution in a mobile ad hoc network environment. The contractor has proposed to investigate innovative approaches that enable efficient use of network resources to provide secure, on-demand access by warfighters at the edge to relevant battlefield content. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. The USC ISI Team offers DARPA a unique opportunity that matches the DARPA CBMEN program objectives that the Mobile System Integrator (MSI) not only provide physical test articles, but also select and adapt applications that highlight the military capability that has been achieved, provide an integration setting that is flexible and supportive of the widest range of approaches to the program, and also provide assessments and metrics that demonstrate the program's utility.<br />

CHICAGO, IL  60640
<DESC>In Building 238, there are three crane rail systems that are used to lift parts from the training engines below
them. Two crane rail systems, consisting of a pair of 2-ton crane rails, are not located so as to allow
the safe hoisting of engine parts. According to Navy Crane Center Inspectors, lifting at the east and west
systems causes lateral loading (torque) on these crane rail systems. This places them out of compliance
with the Navy Crane Center code. The scope of this project is to modify the east and west crane rail systems
to bring them into compliance with the code by eliminating their lateral loading during lifts. The center
crane rail system, at some point, has been modified to eliminate lateral loading during its lifts directly over
the engine.
 The modifications must eliminate any lateral loading (torque) on the systems when lifting over the engines.

<FOJA>Follow-on Delivery Order Following Competitive Initial Order
<AWDNBR>FA8771-04-D-0007
<DONBR>TB01
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY
<p>I. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY, CONTRACTING ACTIVITY, AND JUSTIFICATION<br />A. Agency: Department of the Air Force, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), MILSATCOM Systems Directorate, Logistics and Operations Support Division (SMC/MCL)<br />B. Contracting Activity: SMC/PKL, Peterson AFB, CO<br />C. Justification Type: Logical Follow-on to an Order Issued Under the NETCENTS Contract<br />D. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Department of the Air Force NETCENTS (Network-Centric Solutions) contract IAW FAR 16.505.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit through a Fair Opportunity Exception (FOE) justification and award a three-month bridge task order for Ground Multi-band Terminal (GMT) Depot Support to General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) under the NETCENTS (Network-Centric Solutions) contract IAW FAR 16.505.</p>
<p>This requirement is for a standalone NETCENTStask order to serve as a three-month bridge from 01 May 2012 through 31 July 2012. This order will support the Air Force's immediate need to bridge a gap in service from the end of the current GMT depot contract, which expires 30 April 2012, and a competitive award of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p>The most recent previous competitive order was Task Order 0087 with GDIT under their NETCENTS contract FA8771-04-D-0007, which expirse on 30 April 2012.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>Description<br />The GMT program provides wideband communication services using existing Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) satellites, the new Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites, and commercial satellites. GMT is interoperable with legacy Super High Frequency (SHF) terminals, replaces the aging Ground Mobile Forces (GMF) satellite terminals, and is designed to be upgradable to incorporate new technologies and capabilities in the future. The GMT program consists of 133 terminals and associated antennas, 20 Large Aperture Multiband Deployable Antennas (LAMDA) fielded as part of the initial GMT package and 113 Quad-band Large Aperture Antennas (QLAA) being fielded as part of a GMT improvement package.</p>
<p>The GMT depot facility was originally established in Needham, MA under Theater Deployable Communications (TDC) for assorted tactical communications systems. The GMT depot was detached from TDCand moved to Colorado Springs, CO as a stand-alone program. The depot operation is basically a stock, store, and issue operation with a moderate level of subject matter expertise required for field support. The contract consists of GMT hardware and software maintenance, secure depot warehousing and logistics to include shipping, receiving, inventory, storage, control, and common fault isolation techniques.</p>
<p>Currently GDIT provides GMT sustainment support to eight (8) Major Commands and over fifty (50) organizational units through task order 0087 awarded as a centralized task order under NECTCENTS Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract FA8771-04-D-0007 on 11 June 2010 by the HQ 754th Electronic Systems Group (ELSG/ES) under AFMC at Gunter Annex, Maxwell Air Force Base.<br />Estimated Value of Three-Month Bridge<br />The total estimated value of the three-month bridge contract action is $650K. The value is comprised of facility (facility labor), materials sustainment (direct labor), and Other Direct Costs (ODC) for Materials.</p>
<p>IV. FAIR OPPORTUNITY EXCEPTION AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE - INCLUDING DEMONSTRATION OF PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>Fair Opportunity Exception (FOE)<br />The applicable Fair Opportunity Exception (FOE) authority is FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C) - The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order. This is the first time this exception has been used for the GMT Program under NETCENTS.</p>
<p>Logical Follow-on Supporting Rationale - Including Unique Qualifications<br />GDIT, the proposed contractor, is currently performing all required GMT depot support services necessary to continue to meet mission critical requirements at the current Colorado Springs warehouse site. GDIT has the requisite GMT system knowledge necessary to isolate repair requests and to provide help center functions. GDIT has an active lease in place for the fully operational secure depot facility in Colorado Springs. GDITactively maintains the facility withqualified personnel, in conformance with the contract requirements and the associated DD-254 security requirements. GDIT has a provenpast performance record that attests to the company's knowledge of, and experience with, GMT Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). GDIT currently provides the full range of sustainment support for GMT hardware and software maintenance, secure depot warehousing and logistics (including shipping, receiving, and inventory storage/maintenance/control), and common fault isolation techniques required to assist the GMT community in the sustainment of the GMT Satellite Communications (SATCOM) terminals, the Large Aperture Multi-band Deployable Antennas (LAMDA), and the Quad-band Large Aperture Antennas (QLAA). GDIThas extensive experience coordinating with the MILSATCOM operating field unit, the GMT original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and component vendors. GDIT actively manages all necessary actions, tools, spare parts, labor, materials, technical data, facilities, packaging, and transportation to accomplish the repair and delivery of serviceable GMT asset(s) to the Government. GDIT has a successful record in the area of GMT software sustainment, and the company is adept at investigating and resolving problem reports and using technical data and program documentation to assist or provide the MILSATCOMoperating field unit with applicable software imaging disks.</p>
<p>While other contractors may be capable of performing the GMT Depot Support in the long-term, in the required near term three-month bridge period, it is not expected that another company would be able to successfully ramp up and assume/perform all of the required sustainment support services currently managed by GDIT at the current Colorado Springs warehouse site. Any prospective company other than GDIT would be required to obtain a secured warehouse of approximately 3,000 sq ft for parts inventory (including a secured cryptocontrolled area) within the city limits of Colorado Springs, Colorado for three-months and then staff it for that time period withqualified/experienced personnel with a Secret security clearance. To maintain the current level of service, the personnel would also be required to have sufficient GMT equipment knowledge to immediately provide help desk services and fault isolation guidance to the MILSATCOMoperational community. The prospective company would also need to ensure a transparent transition with sufficient administrative processes, databases, and know-how to process immediate and ongoing GMT purchases/replacements/repairs for CONUS, OCONUS, and CCI controlled requests. The current level of depot sustainment would need to maintained, and the prospective company would be required to seamlessly assume the responsibility to package, handle, store, and transport GMT repair materials at the current levels of service. The prospective contractor would also need to immediately and seamlessly implement an expenditures tracking and approval system capable of identifying all charges submitted to the Government. The contractor would be required to concurrently implement a logistics and trending analysis reporting system as well as an Incident Reports processing/tracking system comparable to that in place and managed by GDIT.</p>
<p>Thus based on the need to successfully assume and fulfill the above requirements in order to maintain transparent operations for the GMT Depot Support in the short-term period of three months, it is very unlikely that another company would be able to accomplish the requirement in the short timeframe while also mitigating the impact of personnel turnover and implementing a fully successful transition. The costs to the prospective competitive contractor would likely be prohibitive. Establishing a new depot capability would require moving the inventory at a significant cost, establishing a new facility lease, and would likely include administrative delays in establishing a new labor force of security-cleared personnel. These additional costs are costs that would not be borne by the current incumbent contractor, GDIT. The prospective competitive contractor is also not guaranteed that they will be awarded the new task after the proposed bridge expires on 31 July 2012. Given these factors and considering the extremely short time before the depot ceases operation on 30 April 2012, the most expedient means for the Government to maintain operational support is to establish a short-term bridge contract with the current contractor, GDIT.</p>
<p>Relationship Between the Current Task Order and Three-Month Bridge in Terms of Scope, Period of Performance, and Value<br />The scope of the three-month bridge follow-on is identical to the scope of the current task order (0087) being performed by GDIT, and GDIT will be expected to perform the identical tasks and services as those currently being performed.</p>
<p>As noted above, the required three-month period of performance is necessary to bridge a gap in service from the end of the current GMT contract, which expires 30 April 2012, and the competitive award of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p>The estimated value for the three-month bridge is based on the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) developed by the GMT Program Office. This is the amount that will have to be duplicated by another contractor to accomplish the required GMT work for the Government. If there are any differences in the value proposed by GDITfor the three-month bridge, they are expected to be slight and attributable to rate differences, transportation/shipping costs increases due to fuel cost increases, and/or changes in lease costs.<br /><br />V. CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINATION THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The current GMT NETCENTS task order (0087) and the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) created by the GMT Program Office will serve as the basis for determining that the anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable. By placing an the three-month bridge order against the GDIT NETCENTS contract, the ordering activity has concluded that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs.</p>
<p>VI. OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION FOR A FAIR OPPORTUNITY EXCEPTION</p>
<p>The Ground Multi-band Terminal (GMT) depot operations contract expires 30 April 2012. A follow-on GMT sustainmentsupport depot contract cannot be established in time to continue depot operations and provide GMT mission support. If the three-month bridge cannot be established, the GMT sustainment support that GDIT currently provides to the eight (8) Major Commands and over fifty (50) organizational units will end, and approximately $6.5M of inventory will be displaced without a storage facility. There is no other alternative available to provide the required GMT sustainment support.</p>
<p>VII. STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES<br />A follow-on GMT sustainment support depot NETCENTStask order is planned for award by 31 July 2012, with an effective date of 01 August 2012. This order will be competed amongst the eight (8) NETCENTS multiple award contract holders IAW the NETCENTS Ordering Guide and the Fair Opportunity procedures under FAR 16.505.<br /><br />There are two small businesses with contracts under the NETCENTS multiple award contract vehicle. Based on communications between the SMC/PKL Contracting Officer and the two (2) small businesses under NETCENTS, only one of the two Small Businesses indicated they would propose under the competitive follow-on effort. Based on these findings, the SMC/PKL Contracting Officer determined that the follow-on task order will not be conducted as a Small Business set-aside, and a DD2579 documenting this determination was approved and is on file.</p>
<p>A Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) was also sent to the seven remaining NETCENTScontract holders on 06 April 2012 with a response date of 12:00 noon on 11 April 2012. The NOCAprovided notification of the Government's intent to issue the GMT three-month bridge NETCENTS order to GDIT, and it also provided notification that the GMT depot follow-on effort after the bridge would be conducted as a Fair Opportunity competition amongst all eight NETCENTScontract holders. No objections to the three-month bridge announced under the NOCA were received from any of the seven remaining NETCENTS contract holders.</p>
<p>VIII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION<br />The Contracting Officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document of this logical follow-on Fair Opportunity Exception (FOE) justification evidences that the Contracting Officer has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of their knowledge and belief and serves as the Contracting Officer's Certification of this FOE justification.</p>
<p>IX. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL CERTIFICATIONS<br />The signatures of the GMT Program Office on the Coordination and Approval Document of this logical follow-on Fair Opportunity Exception (FOE) justification are evidence that the GMT Program Office's personnel have determined this document - and the supporting data and information relied on to create the document - are both accurate and complete to the best of their knowledge and belief. The signatures are also evidence that the GMT Program Office has verified that the data and information which form the basis for this justification reflect the Government's minimum needs and requirements and support the rationale for the logical follow-on fair opportunity exception. Based on the foregoing, the GMT Program Office's signatures serve as their official certification of this logical follow-on Fair Opportunity Exception justification.</p>
