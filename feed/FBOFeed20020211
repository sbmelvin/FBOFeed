<DESC>NA POC Charles Penta, VIS Program (PM DCATS),(732) 532-1178. This is a Request for Information (RFI) Market Survey to determine availability of a new Family of Headsets expected in the next four years that may satisfy both current and future requirements.  Al l headsets shall interface with and work properly with the existing AN/VIC-3(V), also called the Vehicular Intercommunications System (VIS).  The following five headset performances are anticipated.  Commonality of components or parts between headset types  should be identified:  HEADSET #1 -- This headset will be intended for tactical wheeled vehicles and operate in a noise environment of approximately 95 dB(A).  The headset will need to comfortably fit when worn with the PASGT infantry helmet shell and not  be difficult to don or remove, nor limit the soldiers’ ability to egress with minimum delays.  HEADSET #2 -- This headset will be intended for tactical vehicles with a much higher noise environment (i.e., 115 dB(A)) such as a Bradley M2A3.  It should have  the same capability as that described by (1), but will be worn with the CVC helmet shell (MIL-H-44117).  HEADSET #3 -- This headset will be intended to be worn with the PASGT shell but be in a noise environment similar to (2).

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID/Indonesia), in cooperation with the Government of Indonesia  State Ministry for National Development Planning, is providing notification to potential offerors of its intention to award a follow-on contract to the existing Contract No. 497-C-00-98-00045-00 with the current contractor, Nathan-Checchi Joint Venture.   The follow-on contract will provide additional funding of approximately $4.9 million and additional level of effort of 153 person months to the activity.   The current contract ends in October 2002, and will be extended to June 30, 2003.   

        The continuation of the Partnership for Economic Growth (PEG) contract is a major activity of USAID/Indonesia economic growth program until the contract ends as proposed June 30, 2003.  The current contract consists of two parts: a technical assistance component (PEG-TA) and a grants component (PEG-G).  This follow-on contract will also consist of both a PEG-TA and a PEG grants management component.   The goal of this follow-on activity for PEG-TA like the current PEG-TA, is to help Indonesia strengthen its economic growth by dealing with key causes and effects of the slow recovery from the current economic crisis, and to strengthen economic policies and practices associated with increased openness to international trade and domestic competition.  During this extension, USAID will support long-and short-term advisors in a series of governmental institutions that are critical to economic policy formulation and execution, including Bappenas, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Bank Indonesia, and the Coordinating Ministry of the Economy.   The major government goal PEG-TA has been supporting is to provide a strengthened rationale, through quality research and development and provision of advisory and training services, through: macroeconomic policy improvements associated with the current crisis and the ongoing recovery, greater openness to international trade and investment, and improved domestic economic competition, sound economic policy and institutions, a conducive legal andeconomic framework, fair access to economic opportunity, and knowledgeable public participation in economic decision making,   PEG-G has made linkage grants between U.S. and Indonesian institutions (e.g., think tanks, economic research institutions, universities, and government bodies) which focus on economic research and policy development.  The goal of these linkages was to provide a strengthened rationale, through quality research and development work, for policy improvements associated with the current economic crisis, greater openness to international trade and improved domestic competition.  Under the follow-on to PEG-G, the contractor will review and recommend additional grant applications for approval, negotiate and execute approved grants, and help administer both new grants made by USAID and grants made by PEG-G with existing or additional grant funds.  The follow on contract will provide additional funding of $4.9 million and additional level of effort of 153 person months, composed of 117 person months of  long-term and 36 person months of short-term TA.  The current completion date of the contract, which is October 7, 2002, will be extended to June 30, 2003 to accommodate the extension.  

A Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract is expected under the authority of FAR part 6.302.-1 [Circumstances permitting Other than Full and Open Competition] unless the Contracting Officer determines than more than one source can meet the Governments needs, as a result of this notice.  To respond to this notice and to be considered, offerors must see the Numbered notes 22 and 25 and must strictly comply with the submission requirements.   All responsible sources may submit an expression of interest which must include capability statements.  USAID/Indonesia will not respond to requests nor consider proposals that do not comply with the submission requirements.  It is the sole responsibility of offerors to ensure that their expression of interest and all necessary documents reach the Contracting Office, USAID/Indonesia, at the below address, not later than 45 days from the date of this notice.

<SUBJECT>B--PERSISTENCE OF CRUDE OIL SPILLS ON OPEN WATER
<SOLNBR>1435-01-02-RP-85091Draft CBD Notice
<RESPDATE>030402
<ARCHDATE>04032002
<CONTACT>TERRY CARROLL, PROCUREMENT TECHNICIAN, FAX 703-787-1387
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract to conduct a study entitled "Persistence of Crude Oil Spills on Open Water". This study will compile, collate, and statistically analyze historical data on the persistence of crude oil slicks on open water. The effect of spill size on slick persistence will be quantified as will the effects of environmental conditions, crude oil properties, and response effort.  This study will provide empirically defined endpoints for spill trajectory duration in trajectory modeling of various size ranges of crude oil spills.  ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT: The government estimates a period of performance for this contract of twelve (12) months and a cost range of between $100,000 to $120,000. BACKGROUND: In environmental assessments, the MMS typically uses standard time periods such as 1, 3, 10, and 30 days to analyze the effects of open water crude oil slicks.  Hypothetical spill trajectory contacts through these time periods are collated and reported in the MMS oil spill trajectory model analysis, but the model analysis does not take weathering or other dissipation of the hypothetical slicks into account.  The oil weathering is estimated separately from the trajectory model, using an oil weathering model.  State-of-the-art oil weathering models such as those currently used by MMS (and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA]) only address initial weathering, primarily evaporation and vertical (droplet) dispersion.  Only for the lightest crude oils or in the roughest weather will evaporation and vertical dispersion alone dissipate a slick on open water.  For heavier oils or moderate seas, the models unrealistically project that even a one-cup spill would create a permanent slick (which may continue to expand). None of the models used track slick integrity.  Nor do databases for existing weathering models and other databases maintained by MMS and others compile the necessary spill information as to when slicks visibly dissipate as function of time and spill size.  GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: This study will 1) collect and collate historical data on the persistence of crude oil slicks in open water for accidental and experimental spills, 2) apply statistical methods to analyze persistence of crude slicks as a function of initial slick volume, environmental conditions, oil properties, and response effort, and  3) develop correlations, equations, or other empirical predictors of slick duration for size categories used by MMS.  SCOPE OF WORK: TASK 1.  HOLD POST-AWARD CONFERENCE WITH MMS --The Contractor shall hold a post-award conference in Anchorage with Alaska OCS Region and other MMS staff within three weeks of contract award, to insure a clear understanding by all of study tasks, concerns, availability of relevant data and reports, and timelines.  The Contractor shall provide a draft agenda to participants prior to the meeting and provide a strawman list of spill persistence parameters to collate (spill [and/or climatic] environmental factors such as wave height, wave energy period, wind speed, air/water temperature, and distance from shore; oil properties; generic spill response/detection information such as spill name, spill size, crude oil type, whether there was a response, length of response, response methods, effectiveness of response, amount of crude recovered. reason for ending response; etc.) for discussion during the meeting.  The Contractor shall provide a Meeting Summary to participants within one week of meeting, and list any changes needed to plan work as a result of the meeting.  TASK 2.  CONDUCT EXTENSIVE LITERATURE AND/OR DATABASE SURVEY AND COLLATE SPILL PERSISTENCE PARAMETERS -- Offerors shall make their own recommendations as to data sources in their proposal and provide rationales for these choices.  Likely data sources include MMS, NOAA, United States Coast Guard, and Environment Canada reports, Marine Pollution Bulletin, and the Oil Spill Intelligence Report. The MMS anticipates that local weather and oceanographic data collected during the spill events will provide the best source of weather data for use in analyses of environmental factors.  However, Offerors shall discuss and make their own recommendations as to best type(s) of weather data to use for analyses of environmental factors.   Discuss weaknesses and strengths of using weather history recorded during individual spills, average weather during individual spills, seasonal climatic values or indexes, or Offeror's other preferred alternative.  Extracted data parameters on environmental conditions, properties of the spilled crude, and spill response/detection information shall be referenced as to sources and compiled in Excel or Access formats or exported to one of those two formats.  The MMS expects that the portion of this data set that could be analyzed in the following Task 3 may be small.  The Contractor shall contact original spill participants (Coast Guard On-Scene Commander, spiller, responders, NOAA scientific coordinators, etc) to obtain needed but missing data parameters which  could increase the size of the analyzable portion of this data set to an adequate statistical size for Task 3.  TASK 3.  ANALYZE PERSISTENCES OF CRUDE OIL SLICKS RELATIVE TO SIZE AND OTHER FACTORS -- The Contractor shall analyze the collated data set to identify size ranges that are relevant to the MMS NEPA analyses and for evaluating Oil Discharge Prevention Contingency Plans.  The first goal and primary goal is to project generalized time end points for trajectory modeling.  That is, how long will the slick last?  Spill size-range categories such as 500 to 9,999 and 1,000 to 9,999; 10,000 to 50,000; 50,000 to 150,000; and >150,000 bbl would be most useful to MMS if data are sufficient.  The second goal is to statistically analyze the data set to determine quantitative relationships or correlations that can be made among the persistence of crude oil spills on the water surface and both the associated environmental factors and the physical/chemical properties of the oil. The third goal is to statistically analyze the data set to determine quantitative relationships or correlations that can be made among the persistence of crude oil spills on the water surface, the associated environmental factors, the physical/chemical properties of the oil, and response effort parameters.  The Contractor shall be capable of conducting analyses on small data sets.  The Contractor shall include appropriate statistical error analyses and parameter range estimates. The MMS needs to know whether fit coefficients are significant.  TASK 4. DEVELOP CORRELATIONS, EQUATIONS, OR OTHER EMPIRICAL PREDICTORS OF SLICK DISSIPATION FOR SIZE CATEGORIES USED BY MMS -- The Contractor shall identify average or mean persistence time periods for each range of spill size categories based on the analysis of the data set.  Develop correlations, equations, or other empirical predictors of slick duration for size categories used by MMS based on average or typical Alaska OCS conditions and spill size.  Develop a second predictor or set of predictors of slick duration on specific slick size, spilled oil properties, and environmental conditions. The Contractor shall provide more than just a fitted equation.  The Contractor shall provide appropriate statistical error analyses and parameter range estimates. The Contractor shall provide significance estimates for each coefficient and separate sensitivity analyses of the prediction to the range of parameter inputs covering the same range as the observed data.  The Contractor shall list and discuss the critical assumptions under which the predictor equations should give appropriate estimates. These assumptions will likely include both statistical and data-source issues. TASK 5.  PROGRAM AND DATA MANAGEMENT -- The Contractor shall operate under the program-management plan and data-management plan described in the Contractor's proposal. TASK 6.  REPORTING -- Interim Progress Reports:  The Contractor shall submit interim progress (letter) reports to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).  The progress reports shall include: (1) a brief summary of all preceding work and overall progress made against the schedule, (2) a brief summary of any resolutions agreed to between Contractor and MMS regarding these problems, (3) a brief summary of significant technical, schedule, or cost problems encountered, including an assessment of their probable effects on meeting contract provisions, and (4) a list of all significant meetings held, Task 5 consultations, or other contacts made in connection with the contract, including a brief summary of the participants and subject, date, location, and outcome of each such contact or meeting.  Draft Final Report and Draft Technical Summary: The contractor shall complete and submit draft Final Report and Technical Summary to MMS for scientific and editorial review in accordance with the schedule in Section F of the RFP.  The report should describe results of Tasks 2 through 4.  The Technical Summary should cover all technical Tasks. A copy of the standard MMS formatting requirements for technical summaries and cover/title page specifications for the report will be provided by MMS after contract award.  The MMS shall review the draft report and summary and shall provide review comments to the Contractor within 30 to 45 days after receiving the draft documents.  Revised, Final Report and Technical Summary:  The Contractor shall revise the Final Report and Technical Summary and complete as per review comments and post-draft report teleconference, in accordance with the schedule in Section F of the RFP.  Provide the rationale in a letter accompanying the final report for any review comments not accommodated.  Provide 100 copies of the report, a high-quality master copy, and a PC-compatible digital copy to MMS.  Text and tables of the digital copy of the report should in Microsoft (MS) Word 6.  A digital copy of the collated spill data file should be provided in Excel or Access.  Provide bibliographic citations for the final report and data file sources to MMS also in ProCite 4 or newer (or as a file directly importable into ProCite). Provide a final Technical Summary, revised from the draft as per review comments and a PC-compatible digital copy in MS Word 6 to MMS.

<DESC>This requirement was announced earlier as CI-01-12357 and was then delayed due to construction delays.  Although the labs will not be occupied until after September 2002,  the solicitation will proceed with an award to be made in a May/June time frame. A state-of-the-art consolidated campus is under construction in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina to house EPA's research operations.  To ensure that their research data are of the highest quality possible,  National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) investigators will need unconstrained access to purified water for a variety of purposes such as  cleaning glassware;  preparing dosing solutions, tissue culture media, and buffers for analytical assays and sensitive procedures (e.g., molecular biology techniques).  For these and other purposes, the presence of contaminants in the water system can result in erroneous data at a considerable financial and reputational cost to the Agency, and so must be avoided    The purpose of this contract is to obtain and install state-of-the-art water-purification systems capable of providing NHEERL research laboratories with Type I reagent-grade deionized water on demand.   In addition, the Contractor shall provide these designated laboratories access to the water by installing sink-mounted, free-standing faucets as well as stub-outs to enable subsequent connections to laboratory dishwashers. The contractor shall provide all management, licensed personnel, and labor to perform the installation of the system in accordance with all applicable industry performance standards, national, state, and local codes, and federal specifications.  The contractor shall be responsible for obtaining all permits as required for performance of the work.  Permits shall be obtained from the county building inspector relative to the accomplishment of work required to meet the state of North Carolina building codes.  The Contractor shall provide and install in the service corridors of each of 10 designated floors an Underwriters Laboratory (UL)-approved compact water-purification system capable of reliably providing water on demand that meets or exceeds the American Society for Testing and Materials' (ASTM) specifications for Type I reagent-grade water.   In addition, one single-user, UL-approved system providing water of equal quality also shall be installed where indicated.  Each of the 10 centrally located systems shall be designed to fit within the constraints of the usable area of the service corridor.  Each installed system shall include:  (1) a distribution loop that recirculates the purified water to all laboratory points of use; (2) one readily visible resistivity monitor to alert users to loss of water quality; and (3) an ultraviolet purifier.   Of these features, the single-user system shall include only the resistivity monitor and ultraviolet purifier. For each of the 10 centralized systems, the Contractor shall make the following types of connections as designated on the attached floor plans:   To enable unconstrained laboratory access to water, the Contractor shall purchase, install and connect to the floor's central water-purification system a total of 112 free-standing faucets at the designated locations.  In each of the 5 rooms so designated on the attached plans, the Contractor also shall purchase, install, and connect to the water purification system, 1 wall stub-out that will enable subsequent connection to one or more dishwashers.   For the single-user system, the Contractor shall purchase, install, and connect a free-standing faucet.   A proposal site visit will be conducted in March.  The specific date be  established in the solicitation.  Due to the complexity of the installation, companies must attend the meeting and the walk-through in order to be considered for award.   Proposals will be due about four weeks after the site visit.  The solicitation will be posted on the EPA web site  about 2/22/02 and will be available only from the web site. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.

NAWCWD intends to extend the period of performance for Order 0003 from February 28, 2002 to September 30, 2002.

In addition, the TPP P-3 Aircraft Parachute System drawing package is not releasable due to proprietary markings making design information unavailable.

	3.	Each room must have a suitable sound system so all participants may hear and ask questions of the speakers.

All facilities, including rest rooms and audio-visual equipment, must be fully accessible to individuals with disabilities.  Accommodations for disabled individuals may include, but are not necessarily limited to, wheelchair ramps and accessible parking spaces, elevators, sound systems and aisles.

	Section A:	MEETING ROOMS:

		Meeting Rooms:	The general session room and the breakout rooms should be arranged classroom style with chairs and tables for writing and handouts.



		Furniture:	Chairs and tables or desks of sufficient size and in acceptable condition.  Sufficient size is a minimum of 4 square feet of table space per person, though since we anticipate distributing many books and other training materials, we would prefer a larger space per person, if possible.  Acceptable condition means that furniture is not broken, soiled, rusted or damaged in any way that would injure the individuals or damage clothing.  Chairs must be comfortable for long periods of sitting.  Note that aisle space, including the space between tables or desks, needs to be accessible for persons in wheelchairs.

		Sound Acoustics:	Walls should be constructed in such a manner that they confine inside sound and reduce or prevent the transmission of extraneous sound.  Meeting rooms that are divided by partitions must be sound proof enough to prevent disturbance from other outside traffic.  Meeting rooms in a classroom and luncheon style configuration should be equipped with a working sound system which may be controlled by the speaker and which projects equally to all areas of the room.

		View of Speakers:	Rooms should be configured as to allow every participant a clear view of the speaker and all visual aids.

		Lighting:	Rooms should be well lit to accommodate extensive reading and writing.  Lighting should be uniform and should not produce a glare.

		Ventilation:	Heating and air conditioning should provide a comfortable level of air quality and room temperature when rooms are at maximum capacity.

	Section B:	FOOD AND BEVERAGES:

		All food and beverages services need to be located in areas accessible to individuals with disabilities (e.g., wheelchair-accessible).  The lunch room should be arranged so that all individuals can be seated and served efficiently.

	Section C:	SECURED STORAGE AND DELIVERY SERVICES:

		The contractor shall provide for the receipt and accommodation of government seminar materials prior to the scheduled seminar.  The contractor shall store the materials received in a secure place accessed only by the designated government project officer and an authorized contractor official.

	Section D:	LODGING:

		We estimate that approximately 550+ sleeping rooms will be required for staff/speaker and attendees.  This block of rooms must be available for registration through a cutoff date to be determined upon award of contract.  The contractor shall provide these rooms at or below the federal government lodging rate for the Atlantic City area.  Room arrangements and payments shall be made by the attendees.


		Additionally, we anticipate that some participants will come from outside the area since the seminar will be advertised to a multi-state region encompassing numerous federal agencies and federal contractors who may require overnight lodging.  The contractor should provide the federal government lodging rate for these individuals, when individuals lodging reservations are made timely.  Federal tax will not be charged to registrants with government identification.

<DESC>The Department of Justice, Procurement Services Staff, intends to negotiate and award a contract to Protect Data Security, Inc. (PDSI) for a site license and maintenance of their PointSec security software product for laptops and similar portable devices.  After conducting market research, the DOJ believes that the PointSec product is uniquely qualified to meet all of its requirements, which include complete disk encryption, use of one-time dynamic passwords, user/administrator friendliness, compliance with the appropriate FIPS, and compatibility with existing software and management processes.  DOJ currently possesses a license with PDSI for the PointSec laptop encryption software for several thousand laptops owned by the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.  At this time, we are expanding the use of PointSec software to all laptops and personal data assistant devices owned by the Justice Consolidated Office Network (JCON) community comprising of twelve DOJ components and approximately 33,000 systems.  The resulting fixed-price contract will consist of the purchase of a perpetual license, updates, and 24x7 maintenance during the base year, and include four one year options to continue the update/maintenance contract.  This procurement is being conducted under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1966, as implemented through FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, using simplified acquisition procedures.  Other parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by submitting written pricing data and technical information not later than fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of this notice.  No solicitation document is available.  A determination by the DOJ to continue with the sole-source, or convert this to a competed action based on the information received, if any, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No further notices shall be issued.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Solicitation DAAE30-02-R-0809 replaces solicitation DAAE30-02-R-0802 (DRAFT ONLY).  US Army TACOM-ARDEC is contemplating the award of a four-year multiyear  contract for the production of the M782 Multi-Option Fuze for Artillery  (MOFA).  The M782 fuze is the multi-option fuze for artillery which provides  four modes of operation (point, detonating, delay, time, and proximity).  This  fuze is intended for use with all bulk filled artillery munitions used in 105mm  and 155mm howitzer systems.  The US Army plans to pursue production through a  competitively awarded multiyear contract for FY02 thru FY05, limiting  competition to the U.S. and/or Canadian sources in accordance with FAR 6.302-3  Industrial Mobilization; Engineering, Development, or Research Capability; or  Expert Services.  The reason for the authority cited is a) A domestic source  (U.S. or Canadian) is necessary to maintain the industrial base, b) a domestic  source (U.S. or Canadian) is necessary to accomplish replenishment, and c) the  M782 fuze contains critical technology items and is vital to national  security.  Quantities are estimated at 139,000 each M782 in FY02; 142,000 each  M782 in FY03; 137,000 each M782 in FY04; and 138,000 each M782 in FY05. The  contract shall contain option quantities for approximately 55,000 each M782 in  FY02, 60,000 each M782 in FY03, 60,000 each M782 in FY04, and 60,000 each M782  in FY05.  The Technical Data Package (TDP) contains sensitive technology  included in the Militarily Critical Technology List (MCTL).  Therefore the TDP  is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act Title 22, U.S.C. Sec 2778(a) and  2794(7) and is subject to Dod Directives 5230.24 and 5230.25.  Drawings are  marked with limited distribution "D" statement which limits distribution to  Department of Defense components and their contractor.  The Request for  Proposal (RFP) will be available (without the TDP) electronically from the  World Wide Web at the following Internet address: http://procnet.pica.army.mil.  Send requests for TDP to Marianne Shuster, Contracting Officer, AMSTA-AQ-APH,  Bldg 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806; email mshuster@pica.army.mil.  All  requests for TDP must include a certified copy of DD Form 2345, "Militarily  Critical Tehnical Data Agreement."  See numbered Notes 8,12,26.

<DESC>This is a Market Survey to locate sources for a digital underwater communications system for the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA).  NAVSEA has identified a need for a digital underwater communications system to pass ship-to-ship information between submarines during undersea warfare exercises.  This system would allow for the transmission of precise location information between the ships when in open ocean exercises to allow for accurate reconstruction of exercise events.  The system should interface directly with existing active sonar systems and add-on range position location systems, commonly known as range pingers.  The system should be capable of compensating for environmental conditions to ensure data integrity.  It should have easily modified software to add functionality as determined by future navy requirements.  Suppliers interested in furnishing this capability shoul d contact Robert Jackson via e-mail at JacksonRR@navsea.navy.mil; by telephone at (202) 781-3428; or in writing at Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Robert Jackson, SEA 92C, 612 Sicard St. M/S 7028, Washington Navy Yard DC 20376-7028.

<DESC>DOE will only consider applications from Federally-recognized Tribes or Alaskan Native Corporations.  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is announcing its intention to solicit applications for the development of renewable energy on Tribal lands.  Through cooperative agreements, DOE intends to provide financial support to conduct feasibility studies and share in the cost of implementing sustainable renewable energy installations on Tribal lands.  Under this solicitation, DOE is soliciting Applications from Federally-recognized Tribes or Alaskan Native Corporations (hereafter referred to as ?Tribes?) to either: 1) conduct feasibility studies for the development of economically sustainable renewable energy installations on Tribal Lands; or 2) implement sustainable renewable energy development projects.  DOE will only consider Applications from Federally-recognized Tribes on whose Tribal Lands the project will be located.  Applications from a consortium of Tribes will be accepted but must be submitted by a single Tribe representing the consortium. Awards under this solicitation will be cooperative agreements with terms of one to three years depending on the type and scope of the proposed project. Subject to funding availability, the total DOE funding available under this solicitation will be approximately  $2,500,000.  DOE anticipates selecting 10 to 15 Renewable Energy Feasibility Study Applications and 3 to 5 Renewable Energy Development Project Applications for negotiation toward Award.  If funding is appropriated in the Government?s Fiscal Year 2003 (October 1, 2002 through September 30, 2003), opportunities to apply for development projects as well as funding for additional feasibility studies will be provided. No cost share is required in order to be considered for feasibility study awards under this solicitation.  For development projects, a minimum cost share of 20% of total project costs is required to be considered for award. However, applicants that propose more than the required cost share will be given additional consideration in the selection process.  All applicant cost sharing must come from non-Federal sources (i.e., private, state or local Government, or any other sources that were not originally derived from Federal funds). A pre-application conference will be held on March 20, 2002 from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon at the Red Lion Hotel Denver Central, 4040 Quebec Street, Denver, Colorado 80216.  For responses at the Pre-Application conference, potential Applicants should submit questions in writing by March 12, 2002.  The solicitation will provide information on how to transmit questions.  All interested parties are encouraged to attend the pre-application conference. To confirm your participation or obtain additional information, please contact the Solicitation Coordinator at (303) 275-4716 or via facsimile at (303) 275-4788. The pre-application conference is being held in conjunction with the Council of Energy Resource Tribes (CERT) Sustainability Conference.  For additional information on the CERT Sustainability Conference to be held March 21-22, 2002 visit http://www.certredearth.com/.

This Solicitation is being refreshed to include new and updated clauses pertaining to the Multiple Schedule Program. The Solicitation can be downloaded from the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The new term "Evergreen Contracting" option periods has been added to this Solicitation. Evergreen contracts provides new policies and procedures to expand the multiyear contracts for all Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) Federal Supply Schedules to one 5 year basic contract period and three separate 5 year option periods. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option to extend the contract for an additional three five (5) years, by providing a written notice to the contractor at least 150 days in advance prior to the expiration of the contract period. When the Government exercises its option to extend the term of this contract, option prices must be determined fair and reasonable at the time the option is exercised. The Contracting Officer will obtain a contractor statement that the basis of award customer/Most Favored Customer (MFC) has remained the same and that pricing information provided to negotiate the contract, as updated through any modifications, has not changed unless an adjustment is made in accordance with another contract clause (e.g., Economic Price Adjustment Clause or Price Reduction Clause). Current contractors are not required to submit an offer under this solicitation issuance. Contracts awarded under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award and will last for a five (5) year period, unless extended under the Evergreen option period, canceled or terminated. All vendors and/current contractors should be aware that the Evergreen Contracting option period can not be exercised if your items offered are not on the GSA Advantage Electronic Pricelist. This solicitation has been prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, which implement Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 (Public Law 103-355), the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106), and the final rule, published as General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) Change 76, regarding commercial item acquisitions under the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The contract format and data requirements in this solicitation differ from previous solicitations. Offerors are strongly encouraged to carefully review the entire solicitation package before submission to ensure compliance with commercial item provisions. Contractors are now required to accept the Government purchase card for payments equal to or less than the micro-purchase threshold for oral and written delivery orders. Contractors are encouraged to accept the Government purchase card for payment for orders above the micro-purchase threshold. See GSAR Clause 552.232.77, entitled "Purchase by Credit Card". This solicitation contains the new clause "Contractor's Report of Sales" (552.238-74), which requires the submission of sales on electronic GSA Form 72A via the Internet and "Industrial Funding Fee" (IFF) (552.238-76) which requires a 1% payment due on a calendar quarter schedule. Offerors must include the IFF in their prices. The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities. GSA has established a contract sales criterion for all Multiple Award Schedules. Clause I-FSS-639, entitled "Contract Sales Criteria", states that a contract will not be awarded if the anticipated sales are not expected to exceed $25,000. Contracts will also be canceled unless reported sales for each 12-month period from date of award are $25,000 or above.

<DESC>This announcement, amendment number 2, issued to answer the following questions asked by potential offerors: Question 1:  The RFQ basically says that everything we see is going to be stabilize and transfer, which means that almost all of the care will be in the ER.  You are asking only for an inpatient rate.  How would ER care be paid? Answer 1:  This solicitation/contract is intended for Saginaw VA patients who are transferred for continued inpatient care.  In some cases, Emergency Room (ER) services will be necessary while transferring patients long distances.  Offerors may submit separate pricing for ER services, which will be considered when evaluating pricing for award. Question 2:  Since all we are going to see is ER cases and they all are going to be transferred out as soon as stable, what do we gain by contracting with you? Answer 2:  Any diagnostic or therapeutic procedures not performed in the first 48 hours of admission need pre-authorization in order to obtain reimbursement.  In cases of life threatening emergency verbal pre-authorization from a VA official must precede direct admission.  Verbal pre-authorization shall be documented with the authorizing official’s name, title, and telephone number, as well as time and date of authorization. The advantage to contracting with the VA is that your medical center will be the VA’s provider of choice in your geographic area. All other terms and conditions of the above numbered RFQ remain the same.

<DESC>Solicitation SP0750-02-R-1521 has been issued and is available at www.dscccols.com/programs/corporate_contracts.  The closing date is March 25, 2002.  The preproposal conference will be held on Feb 26, 2002, 9:00 A.M., at the Defense Supply Center, Columbus, 3990 East Broad Street, Columbus, OH 43216, Building 20.  Please contact Linda Pryor at phone #(614)692-4675 to register your company for attendance...........................................

                                             The Defense Supply Center-Columbus is pursuing a 10-year, firm fixed price (FFP) with economic price adjustment (EPA), indefinite quantity (IQ) type contract under the Fleet Automotive Support Initiative (FASI) for the CONUS East and West regions.  The contract will have a two-year base period followed by one two-year option and two three-year options.  The primary goal of the FASI is to improve customer support at the user level through use of the Virtual Prime Vendor (VPV) concept.  The Vendor(s) will be required to support the identified vehicles at military installations within the region.  DSCC has coordinated with the customer to identify specific vehicles or items for which a FASI prime vendor can provide parts support, technical support, fleet requirements forecasting, inventory management, or other enhanced supply services as required by the customer.  The VPV should be capable of providing integrated logistics support for automotive/vehicle parts within a particular region.  The VPV must be capable of achieving a 98% on-demand issue rate, have the ability to forecast the customer's future needs and develop inventories or business relationships to meet such needs.  The VPV must be capable of providing value added anticipatory services such as, technical support, local Customer Service Representatives, and meet surge and sustainment requirements during mobilization.
A lead military installation will be identified as the initial site for each region.  Contract award for the region will be based on the evaluation of Vendors' proposals for the initial site's requirements.  Following contract award, and once the initial site is implemented through a three party agreement (DSCC, military customer and vendor), FASI will rollout to other customers within each of the regions.  Since FASI is intended to have one Prime Vendor/3PL cover an entire region, each of these roll out sites will be added to the contract without re-solicitation.  Sites are intended to encompass any DoD activity, including the Reserves and National Guard.
A "Market Basket" population of 450 items has been identified for the two implementation sites within the East and West regions.  This population will be included in the solicitation.  The list of 450 items will be available on the DSCC website (www.dscc.dla.mil) or (http://dibbs.dscccols.com/rfp) on or before 11 Jan 02.  Currently, the potential population of items for the East and West regions consists of approximately 11,000 items.

GSA Northeast and Caribbean Region, Solicitation No. GS-02P-02-DTC-0012(N).  This project will modernize and expand the existing Port (US Border Station) at Champlain, NY, with a principal emphasis on site development, road construction, and infrastructure improvements.  As a gateway to the United States, the Port must efficiently process traffic demands and operational requirements, while maintaining adequate safety for the staff and security of the border.  An appropriate Port design must holistically unify existing and new structures / program components into a distinguished and businesslike image reflecting the official status and serious law enforcement functions of the Port.  The expansion, over existing and approximately 27 acres of newly acquired land, consists of the construction of new and relocated commercial vehicle queuing, parking, and inspection areas.  Additionally, the project includes, but is not limited to, the following: construction of a new secondary inspection warehouse / office building for commercial cargo; new cargo x-ray building, new outdoor firing range with service building, new secured impound lot with service building and new export control building with inspection booths; infrastructure for private broker offices; improvements and renovations to the existing main administration building, primary and secondary inspection plazas, and warehouse / garage facilities; demolition of some structures and site features; temporary facilities to accommodate uninterrupted facility operations; and extensive site work.  The gross area of all existing buildings is approximately 4,077 m2 .  The expanded facility (existing and new construction) will contain a rentable area of 6,137 m2, a gross area of 7,261 m2, and 510 outside parking spaces.  The estimated total cost of the expanded facility ranges between $23,000,000 and $25,000,000.

<DESC>TSA Acquisition Announcement


The Department of Transportation (DOT)/Transportation Security Agency (TSA) has initiated an accelerated competition for the management of a program of critical importance and urgency to our country.  This program is to support and coordinate the fielding of explosive detection equipment as mandated by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001.  Consistent with the urgency of this requirement and the authority cited under a Class Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition Under FAR 6.302-2, a competition is underway for the selection of prime contractor to assist TSA with this initiative.  While the initial selection of the potential offerors (to be the prime contractor) was based on market research, this announcement is to 1) solicit responses from additional firms interesting in being the prime contractor and 2) identify possible subcontracting goals relating to this procurement.
Any potential prime contractor must have the experience, resources, and past performance judged to offer a low risk and high probability of success in fielding the required explosive detection equipment by December 2002.  The prime contractor selected will be responsible for the coordination and execution of activities required to meet the aviation checked-baggage screening requirements of the Act.  The activities include, but are not limited to purchasing and coordinating the supply of the needed equipment, managing the installation of equipment into the airport environment, provide support for EDS screener training, and life cycle maintenance.  (Concurrently, and with regard to accelerating current production of the equipment needed as part of the total solution, efforts are under way to place under contract the entire production lines of known and certified firms that manufacture such devices.)

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is to survey the commercial services market for vendors with an interest in supporting the Marine Corps System Command (MCSC).  The MCSC is responsible for research and development, acquisition, life cycle support, and all related activities associated with fielding support equipment, weapons systems, and product improvements to the Fleet Marine Forces.  Detailed information on MCSC organizations, mission responsibilities, and programs is available on the Command web site:  http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/.  

To take advantage of competitive industry trends in commercial acquisition pricing and service offerings, MCSC has established the Commercial Enterprise Omnibus support services (CEOss) program, an indefinite-delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) business model that will be based upon the use of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.404(b)(4) authorizes agencies to establish BPAs with Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contractors and to allow the ordering agency to exercise discretionary control of activity volume.  To establish a logical basis for ordering services, MCSC has defined four (4) domains within the CEOss model:  Specialty Engineering; Business and Analytical; Engineering and Scientific; and Acquisition, Logistics and Administrative.  This RFI will ascertain market supply aligned with expected demand for services, allowing the ACSS to match vendor capabilities to domain (i.e., Command) requirements based upon price and technical sensitivity as illustrated by vendor schedules.  Vendor capabilities will be considered on the basis of fit within each domain, respective of price and services offered.  Those vendors illustrating the best overall fit with MCSC requirements will be provided the opportunity to compete for a prime BPA award within the domain for which they have been selected.  

Vendors may submit only one (1) schedule per domain, or a total of four (4) schedules across all domains.  Vendors seeking consideration in more than one (1) domain should state an order of preference for consideration (i.e., Engineering and Scientific 1, Business and Analytical 2, etc.).  ONLY the following schedules apply:  For the Specialty Engineering domain:  874 MOBIS, 871 Engineering Services, 899 Environmental Services, 70 IT Services and Support, 873 Lab Testing and Analysis; Business and Analytical domain:  874 MOBIS, 872 Financial Management Services, 69 Training Services;   Engineering and Scientific domain:  874 MOBIS, 871 Engineering Services, 70 IT Services and Support; and Acquisition, Logistics and Administrative domain: 874 MOBIS, 874V LOGWORLD.  

Interested vendors should submit ONLY the following:  1)  A capabilities statement, limited to five (5) pages (vendor discretion on content), that identifies a preferred domain, OR the order of preference for consideration if submitting in multiple domains; 2) a copy of the applicable GSA Schedule(s), including an electronic copy on diskette/CD-ROM/hyperlink; and 3) general marketing information.  Additional material submissions will be discarded without review.    

Responses are due no later than 1400 E.S.T on 25 February 2002 and can be mailed to the following address:  COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM CODE ACSS, 2033 Barnett Ave, Suite 315, Quantico, VA 22134-5010.  Responses submitted by FED-EX or UPS should be sent to the following address:  COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM, 2033 Barnett Ave, Room 202, Attn: Cynthia Wells, Code ACSS, Quantico, VA 22134-5010.  Any questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer at wellscr@mcsc.usmc.mil.  Additional information regarding the CEOss program can be found at www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/acss/acssdefault.shtml.

<SUBJECT>--LINGUIST SUPPORT IN/AROUND THE BALKAN PENINSULA
<DESC>NA Wiesbaden Contracting Center (WCC) – Wiesbaden, Germany issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding non-personal interpretation/translation support, hereafter refered to as linguist support, to satisfy requirements for the United States Army – Euro pe, hereinafter known as RA.  The geographic area of operation is in the Balkans; those countries comprising the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Greece, Hungary and limited positions within the continental United States. WCC seeks information from sources who have the immediate capability to provide non-personal linguist support services for uninterrupted service.  Linguists are comprised of local nationals (local to the geographic area in which they perform) and United St ates citizens.  United States citizens are subject to security screening for positions of trust at the Secret and Top Secret levels.  The RA also requires contractor capability to surge up to two times per year to support large-scale exercises in Germany a nd Hungary utilizing specific target languages.  Included languages (not all inclusive) are Albanian, Arabic, Bulgarian, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian, Romanian and Russian, and associated dialectic, regional and ethic langu age aspects therein.  The government is currently utilizing approximately 1000 linguists, of which 75 percent are local national hire, with the remaining 25 percent U.S. citizens.  In the future, government requirements may increase or decrease this quantity or the proportions described above. Non-personal linguist services are required for up to 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week.  In general, day-to-day services per linguist will not exceed 12 hours, however, may exceed this projection dependent upon operational and military necessity. The potential contract would be an cost plus fixed-fee type contract and would allow for inclusion and deletion of countries and linguists during the life of the contract.  The period of performance would be one base year and four option years. WCC seeks comments on the following issues and invites respondents to address each with availability, pros and cons, and concerns as they pertain to linguist support. 1) Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Comment on possible ambiguities, conflicting information, negative impacts to contractor processes/operation and other concerns you may have with/about it.  To obtain a copy of the potential PWS please send an email to  ahujaj@rcc.wbn.usacce.army.mil or johnsone@rcc.wbn.usacce.army.mil with the subject line: RFI - PWS.   2) Corporate Performance-based incentives.  How would the Government identify a performance standard, which could result in reward of incentives?  How would you describe various levels of performance standards?  What are the performance characteristics tha t differentiate one performance standard from others?  Suggest various levels of performance and describe the standard associated with each. 3) Considering a base plus four option years, what reasonable price saving in years three to five could be anticipated, ignoring inflation, compared to the base year?  What incentive(s) could be provided to maintain reasonably lower total costs and fees? 4) What are reasonable daily price ranges for U.S. and foreign linguist services, per language, per country?  What are the bases used to justify your response?  What factors exist when determining cost basis?   5) Is the use of independent or dependent subcontractors an effective solution?   6) How is foreign taxation handled most effectively and efficiently?  U.S. taxation? 7) What are the best methods for linguist selection, evaluation, security screening, and retention? 8) What are cost-effective solutions for locating and obtaining linguists? 9) How do you identify and evaluate potential linguists?  How are skills evaluated? How do you ensure compliance with the Interagency Langua ge Roundtable (ILR) Language Skill Level standards for listening, reading, speaking, and writing?   10) What are the best ways to determine and provide for linguist language training, for example, service overviews, military operations, specialized fields, i.e., law, procurement, Command & Staff, diplomatic, and resolve day-to-day training issues? 11) What methods do you use to provided adequate security screening for the following a. Local Nationals – specify country as applicable. b. US Citizens for Secret and Top Secret clearance. 12) What methods are most efficient to compile and provide secure access to a comprehensive linguist database for day-to-day use by both the contractor and Government? 13) What contractual ways/methods can be used to adjust the number of linguists to meet fluctuating requirements and do so with minimal delay and without contract modification? 14) What anticipated management roles, relationships and structure do you envision?  15) How would you assume contract obligations to provide uninterrupted service and minimize disruption of service? 16) What three questions would you recommend the Government ask your competitors regarding past performance of linguist services in which responses would differentiate and demonstrate your superior service?
