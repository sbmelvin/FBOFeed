<CONTACT>Wallace O. Adcox, Contracting Officer, (703) 787-1354
<DESC>Gov.Works is issuing this request for proposals on behalf of the Department of Energy (DOE). INTERESTED OFFERORS MAY SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR THE FULL SOLICITATION TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER VIA E-MAIL (Wallace.adcox@mms.gov). The full solicitation will then be sent to the offeror by e-mail. DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is soliciting Applications for the development of novel technologies and processes that service the biomass industry broadly and will integrate the production of biomass derived fuels, power, and chemicals and other products into economical, sustainable industrial biorefineries. DOE intends to provide financial support under provisions of Section 2306 of the Energy Policy Act (EPAct), Public Law 102-486, which establishes eligibility requirements for companies to participate in Financial Assistance programs covered under Titles XX through XXIII of the EPAct. Under this solicitation, DOE is seeking Applications that: 1) overcome existing technical and economic barriers in the conversion of cellulosic feedstocks for the production of fuels (such as ethanol, biodiesel, and hydrogen), power, and products at a cost advantage over existing starch based technologies, 2) develop high value chemicals, materials, and other products, from any biomass feedstocks and co-product streams, that can be produced at a cost advantage over conventional feedstocks and significantly improve the overall economics of the industrial biorefinery, and, 3) develop technologies that can be broadly applied and improve the economics and sustainability of the industrial biorefinery.  Applications should clearly address how the proposed work is novel, builds on current knowledge, and will advance the development and subsequent deployment of economical, sustainable industrial biorefineries, particularly those that provide products that can result in significant oil use reduction. Research into feedstock development, direct combustion of biomass, and demonstration beyond the pilot scale will not be funded as a result of this solicitation. The solicitation seeks Applications related to a variety of concepts, including but not limited to: fermentation, hydrolysis, pyrolysis, gasification, and/or other biochemical or thermochemical conversion systems. Awards under this solicitation will be Cooperative Agreements with a project term of up to four years. Subject to funding availability, the total DOE funding under this solicitation will be approximately $20,000,000. DOE anticipates selecting 3-6 multi-year projects for award. Future year funding allocations will depend on the scope and quantity of Applications received. Applications are sought that are multi-year and include a multi-disciplinary project team capable of the successful completion of the technical research as well as the commercialization of research results. A clear tie among the proposed work, expected benefits, and solicitation objectives is required. Technical goals and milestones must be well characterized. The Applications will clearly state economic, energy and oil reduction, and environmental benefits resulting from the industrial biorefinery concept envisioned, and show a clear path to commercialization. A minimum Cost Share of 50% of Total Project Costs is required in order to be considered for Award under this solicitation. See Section II regarding Cost Share. Applications proposing a portion of the work to be performed by Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), including a DOE research laboratory will be considered for Award. Instructions for including FFRDC activities within an Application are provided in Section II of the full solicitation. Applications proposing a portion of work with the Tennessee Valley Authority will be subject to the same restrictions as those proposing work by a FFRDC. DOE IS REQUIRING PRE-APPLICATIONS UNDER THIS SOLICITATION. The Pre-Application will be assessed to determine whether the proposed concept is consistent with the objectives of this Solicitation and whether an Application, if submitted, will be considered for funding. Pre-Applications must address the same criteria as will be required in a formal proposal. PRE-APPLICATIONS MUST NOT EXCEED 2 PAGES OF TEXT, EXCLUDING THE COVER SHEET. All Pre-Applications must be submitted as Word files to the Contracting Officer via e-mail (Wallace.adcox@mms.gov) by May 14, 2002. DOE will review the Pre-Applications and accept or reject the Pre-Application. IF THE PRE-APPLICATION IS REJECTED, NO FURTHER SUBMISSION OF AN APPLICATION WILL BE ACCEPTED. All offerors with an accepted Pre-Application must submit a full Application as a Word file to the Contracting Officer via e-mail by 3:00 PM, on July 12, 2002. An Application received after the due date and time will not be considered for Award. ANY QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS FOR THE FULL SOLICITATION MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER VIA E-MAIL.

<DESC>Arizona Private Detention Services Solicitation - Solicitation MS-99-D-0004.  At the time of issuance the projected start date for work under the resulting contract would start November 2002.   For offerors in the competitive range a solicitation amendment will be issued.  The projected start date remains unchanged.  This solicitation was originally issued with a requirement of up to 2,000 prisoners per day.  This solicitation was issued to provide a contract for the housing and detention of all U.S. Marshals detainees (plus some from Bureau of Prisons and Immigration and Naturalization Service) except those housed in governmental facilities (i.e.  Federal, State and Local jail facilities).  Since that time the need for jail space has increased.  Accordingly the maximum capacity under this solicitation will be increased by amendment from 2,000 prisoners per day to 3,000 prisoners per day.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for upgrades and improvements to ATTILA and ICEM CFD software package. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from  ICEM CFD Engineering, Berkeley, CA as the only known source who can meet agency requirements.  NASA Langley Research Center has utilized the ICEM grid generator which contains ATTILA to investigate the space radiation problem.  ATTILA is a software package for neutral particle and charged particle transport.  ICEM, through a commercial agreement with Los Alamos National Laboratories, is responsible for development and support of the commercial version of ATTILA.  The proposed effort would extend the ATTILA code to allow for more extensive review of the space radiation problem.  It would require significant time and cost for another source to assume this effort which would not be recovered by competition.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 22, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

This site acquisition is being conducted pursuant to statutory authority contained in the Public Buildings Act of 1959, as amended.  40 U.S.C. 601, et seq.  Pursuant to this authority, GSA is authorized to conduct this site selection without regard to the competitive procurement procedures contained in Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, commonly referred to as the Competition in Contracting Act.

The following criteria are being used to consider offered sites, which satisfy the minimum requirement:

The site must be located in the defined delineated area in downtown Ft. Pierce; the site must be of sufficient size as defined above; and, the owner must have marketable title.

General evaluation factors to be considered are:  ability of the site to meet certain environmental requirements, ability of the site to comply with certain regulatory requirements; functionally of the site; and, design developability.

In addition to the above criteria, the total cost of the project considering both the acquisition cost of the site and estimated development and operating costs will be considered.  The Government will select the site considered to be most advantageous to the United States after all factors have been considered.  In order to ensure that the selected site is most advantageous to the United States, the Government will also consider any unique attributes or other nuances of a site deemed worthy of consideration, even if not listed above.

None of the above listed evaluation criteria are considered to be more important than any other.  However, as sites are evaluated, each site's unique attributes may result in one or more criteria becoming more important as to that particular site.  The final selection of the site is within the sole discretion of the government.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the Numberical Simulation of Laminar Turbulent Transition in a Subsonic Boundary Layer.  The contractor shall enahnce an existing high order numerical simulation code for problems related to integrated simulation of laminar turbulent transition in compression flows.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from the University of Texas at Arlington as the only known source who can meet agency requirements.  The proposed research builds upon  existing transition sumulation technology developed by the University of Texas at Arlington.  The proposed tasks involves time accurate simulations of transition flow fields, which involve a combination of deterministic, long range propogation of large scale disturbances and stochastic, short scale turbulent fluctuations.  It would require significant time and cost for another source to assume this effort which would not be recoved by competition.    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 21, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Price Proposals submitted for the seed project will be evaluated as to price reasonableness.  It is anticipated that the Offeror who is awarded the Best Value seed project will meet the Contract guaranteed minimum Base Year period amoun t of $60,000.  Each of the other Offerors selected for Award of the additional IDIQ Contracts will receive Contract minimum guarantee amounts of $60,000 to be reached for the Base Year period of those Contracts.  Price reasonableness that matches an Offero r's technical approach is considered critical in the Government's Price Proposal evaluation.  However, Award of a Contract will not be based solely on the lowest Price.  Significant, unexplained differences where proposed prices do not match a proposed tec hnical approach and risk involved, may result in a Proposal being removed from the Competitive Range.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions with all of the offerors within the Competitive Range. The Government also reserves the right to  Award any Contract(s) with or without discussions.  All Technical Evaluation criteria Factors other than Price when c ombined are significantly more important than Price. After the Government evaluates the Technical and Price Proposals received, a Competitive Range will be determined by the Contracting Officer. The Competitive Range will consist of all of the most highly rated Proposals against all Technical Evaluation criteria Factors and Prices proposed.  The Contracting Officer may limit the number of Proposals in the Competitive Range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highl y rated Proposals in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.  Plans and Specifications will be provided on CD-ROM at no cost (Limit 1 CD-ROM per Offeror).  Paper copies will not be available from the Government. This Solicitation will also be posted on the following  World-Wide-Web internet address: http://www.mvr.usace.army.mil.  Proposals will be accepted from all responsible  sources. The apparent successful offeror(s) must be registered in the Department of  Defense Central Contractor Registration (CCR)database. No Contract Award will be  made to an offeror until this requirement is met.  Offerors not already registered in the CCR database are highly encouraged to do so by calling: 1-888-227-2423, or via the following World-Wide-Web internet address: http://ccr.gov. The North American Indus try Classification System (NAICS) Subsector Codes associated with this  procurement are: 233, 234, & 235, with corresponding Small Business Size Standards of $28.5 Million, $28.5 Million, & $12 Million, respectively.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Solicitation is hereby amended to include delivery schedule as an evaluation factor as indicated:  The following evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance; Technical Capability, Delivery Schedule, Past Performance and Price.  Technical Capability, Delivery Schedule and Past Performance when combined are significantly more importance than price.  The desired delivery schedule is 20 units to be delivered within 14 calendar days after receipt of award.  Every 14 days thereafter 20 more units to be delivered until the total order of 80 each are delivered.  The required delivery schedule is 20 units to be delivered within 60 calendar days after receipt of award, and every 30 days thereafter 20 more units are to be delivered until the total order of 80 each are delivered.  Also, responses to the following questions are provided in reference to subject solicitation: 1) Question:  The initial delivery schedule requested is very tight. These types of products are not built in very high volumes and are available in a variety of different configurations, so a large inventory cannot be practically kept in stock and the lead times are typically greater than 4 weeks. I think it would be difficult for us to make a good-faith proposal with the current 4 weeks and I would not be surprised if other potential suppliers have the same problem.  Response: The delivery schedule will be part of the evaluation factors as indicated above. 2)  Question:  In what format should the final proposal be?  Will there we an actual RFQ issued after April 15.   Exactly what is it that is expected by April 15, 2002?  Response:  The proposal may be provided in the offeror?s own format and shall comply to the instructions, clauses and provisions as provided in the solicitation to be considered for an award.  The solicitation can be found here on FedBizOpps, (www.FedBizOpps.gov).  There is no RFQ, this is a RFP (Request for Proposal) and it was issued April 1, 2002.  Your proposal is due to the US Coast Guard on April 15, 2002 by 3 pm EST.  3) Question:  Can we send a response via Federal Express letter?  Is FAX acceptable?  Response: The proposal must be sent by US Mail or private courier to Catherine Baskin, at the address stated in the RFP.  The proposal is due by April 15, 2002 at 3pm EST.  Federal Express is acceptable however, the offeror bear the risk that the offer is received by the designated time and at the designated place.  No faxes or email will be accepted. 4)  Question:  We are a small business with under 50 employees.  Do we enjoy any preference over the other suppliers?  Response: Preference will be give to a small disadvantaged business or HUBSONE business that have been certified as such with the Small Business Administration.  5)  We are a US company, although the product is being produced in Germany.  Do we enjoy any preference over non-US (Canadian or elsewhere) based suppliers?  Response:  The Trade Agreement at FAR 52.225-5 applies.  Preference is only given to a supplier that offers a product from a non-designated country. 6)  Question:  The product being purchased is intended to operate in a personal type computer (Dell Power-Edge 2500 mentioned in the Pre-solicitation Notice).  This mentions this is available as government furnished equipment for testing (compatibility).  Can you tell how to proceed on requesting as Government Furnished Equipment.  Response:  GFE (Government Furnished Equipment) is provided to the successful offeror at or after time of award not prior to award. 7)  What is the analog bandwidth requirement for the digital storage oscilloscope?  Response:  The ?Analog Bandwidth Requirement? is 25MHz. 8)  What do you consider the length of a standard commercial warranty to be?  Historically it has been one year.  It is now more common for the warranty period to be two or three years.  Response:  Correct. The offeror is requested to provide whatever length of period covers their standard commercial warranty practices.

<DESC>NOTE THE UPDATE IS THE END OF THIS NOTICE. THE FIRST PART OF THIS NOTICE IS A REPEAT OF MODIFICATION #1. The Federal Highway Administration, in association with the US Coast Guard, National Geodetic Survey, and several other Federal agencies, is implementing a High Accuracy Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (HA-NDGPS) capability for test purposes at the Hagerstown, MD, Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) facility. The service is expected to be available from April 2002 until April 2003. Preliminary results indicate that the HA-NDGPS will enable 3-d positioning at an accuracy of 20 cm (95% confidence level) for points located within 200 miles of a single reference station. A Request for Testers of a High Accuracy Differential GPS (HA-NDGPS) System was posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website on January 17, 2002 (http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/OAM/Reference-Number-TFHRC-2002-HANDGPS/Synopsis.html). Up to 4 HA-NDGPS receivers will be loaned to organizations (at no cost to the organization, with no remuneration from the government) to perform tests, for up to a two-month time period during the test period. As a condition of loan, FHWA will require that any data collected be provided to FHWA (with unrestricted data rights) so that further analysis/reporting/documenting of this technique can be accomplished. Electronic proposals from parties interested in testing this technology are being accepted. For more information, see the January 17, 2002 posting. To aid potential testers and users in understanding the techniques used for this service, a workshop is planned for April 16, 2002 at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Auditorium. The purpose of this workshop is to provide industry, academia, and other government agencies with technical details of the High Accuracy NDGPS program. Technical experts will be available to answer technical questions on this service. DATE/TIME: April 16, 2002, 1330 ? 1700 (1:30 PM ? 5:00 PM local time) LOCATION: U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA Silver Spring Metro Campus Auditorium, 1301 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland. *** UPDATE: FOR SECURITY REASONS, ATTENDEES ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY/ADVANCE REGISTER TO MR.

<DESC>Private firms meeting the basic criteria below are invited to contact either Mr. Dave Miller or Antonio Ceballos at the respective e-mail addresses: Dave.Miller@mail.doc.gov and Antonio.Ceballos@mail.doc.gov prior to generating any actual partnership proposal or other submission to the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce/International Trade Administration/ U.S. & Foreign Commercial Service (DOC/ITA/US&FCS) seeks to establish public/private partnerships in connection with its buyusa program and website (http://www.buyusa.com). Buyusa represents a U.S. DOC service introduced in June of 2001 to provide online exporting assistance and facilitation to U.S. firms, particularly small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SME's). 
Internet-based trade contact and information services operate in conjunction with the U.S.&FCS's worldwide network of 100+ domestic and 170+ overseas export and commercial offices, and include selective matchmaking between U.S. firms and overseas trading
partners, trade lead generation and management, market intelligence for both U.S. and international companies, online interaction with U.S.&FCS trade specialists globally, and a "virtual catalog"  capability to display and describe products and services of U.S. exporters. The website is developed and operated via a unique collaboration between the DOC which provides substantive content and exporting solutions, and IBM Corporation which provides e-business and supporting technology solutions. 

The buyusa program operates under the U.S.&FCS cost recovery authority; subscription fees for varying levels of service are paid by U.S. participants, and the resulting revenue is shared by the DOC and IBM, and potentially by other buyusa partners located via this notice. Buyusa registration is free to International
companies. During Government FY-2002 buyusa seeks to expand offerings to both U.S. and International companies, and in so doing will consider proposals from private sector entities engaged in one (1) or more business lines which have clear potential to increase and/or facilitate exporting by U.S. SME's. Those seeking buyusa program  participation must meet the following criteria: 

1. identify at least one existing and operational online service or product which benefits exporting or export-related activities of small-to-medium-sized U.S. businesses. Online capabilities which may meet this criterion include export and trade education, international business intelligence, trade contact location, export logistics and compliance, regulatory or other trade governance information/ services, trade finance, international
transaction completion, shipping, payment, currency and language
conversion, and the like. 2. demonstrated sustained operation for at least two(2) full-years and a sustainable business plan and model. 3. suitability for presence on a U.S. Government website, indicating that: no criminal or civil violations are on record or charged and pending resolution. no debarment or documented unfair trade practices, or charges thereof by a foreign Government, are on record or pending.

No online offerings or business practices are illegal or inappropriate in the U.S. or foreign countries served by buyusa.com, and no clear potential for embarrassment to the U.S. Government exists which might jeopardize the U.S.&FCS mission of promoting U.S. exports abroad. 4. express willingness to offer the online service(s) and/or product(s) in accordance with all applicable terms and conditions of buyusa.com and of U.S. Government websites generally.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) requires a Center of Independent Experts (CIE) with the requisite technical and scientific expertise to provide impartial and comprehensive comments and practical advice through outside peer reviews on scientific issues related to the living marine resource management mandates of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Subjects for reviews may include: stock assessments and population modeling methods for fish, marine mammals, or sea turtles; field sampling procedures or protocols; and review of existing and/or design of new scientific programs or management strategies. The CIE shall handle reviewer selection and ensure that reviewers are free from influences of groups or organizations with vested interests in marine resource usage by obtaining written assurances of no conflict of interest from all reviewers. After reviewer selection, the CIE shall make all necessary travel arrangements for the reviewers; copy and distribute background materials provided by NMFS; and provide intermediate status reports, final written reviews from each reviewer, and a complete accounting of distributed funds. To ensure that the reviews provided to NMFS are of the highest possible quality, the CIE shall thoroughly examine status and draft reports submitted by the reviewers for content, clarity, and compliance with NMFS' task order before passing completed reports to NMFS for final approval. Unless the requirement for a consensus report is specified in the task order, each reviewer's report shall be submitted individually to NMFS. Reviews facilitated by the CIE will vary in scope and duration. Most reviewers will be asked to carry out short-term, narrowly focused assignments requiring approximately 1-3 weeks of their time. The deliverable for a short-term review would typically be a 10-30 page report. Some reviewers could be involved in longer-term projects with a wider scope and more comprehensive deliverable. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPERTS: The reviewers chosen by the CIE must be demonstrably highly reputable experts in the field that is the subject of their review; they must have be able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the applied nature of the science that supports NMFS' mission; and they must be free from even the appearance of any conflict of interest. Reviewers should have a PhD or equivalent degree in a relevant field, five or more years of relevant experience, ten or more peer-reviewed publications in a relevant field, and have a record of successful participation in working groups or scientific review panels.  CAPABILITIES OF THE CIE: The contractor for the CIE must be a research institution with an international reputation in fisheries science, with capabilities to identify and obtain the services of appropriate domestic and foreign scientists, to evaluate and improve the quality of draft reports, to handle the logistics of arranging travel and distributing materials to all regions of the United States, and to manage and administer domestic and international contracts. EVALUATION CRITERIA: The contractor will be selected based on past performance; the proposed processes for running the CIE, selecting reviewers, and avoiding conflicts of interest; and cost. The period of performance shall be July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2007.

We have gaskets around the filter frames to prevent leaking but a smooth surface is important for a good seal.  If providing other than specified we are requesting a sample be sent to FPL for a final decision.

The sides of the tank can only be tapered a maximum of 1/8?.  The bottom must be perpendicular to the sides.  Square ness is important for proper fit of the filters.

The top can have an outward facing lid for structural support.

Bulkheads and standpipe are to be provided but FPL will install.  Standpipe is 3? PVC and is 24? long.

Some tanks will be buried and exposed to frost so take into consideration for strength.

The main concern for the locking mechanism is safety.  The tanks will be in public areas and need to be secured.  We have received various ideas for locks and are open to ideas.

There is not a specific type of handle or location necessary for the lid.  Provide information on what is being provided.

Offerors are encouraged to submit more than one offer when similar items will meet the Government need.  For example, suggestions/offers using other tank material, accessories, or design will be reviewed.

The packaging tasks may be performed onsite or offsite--the main consideration being that if performed onsite there will be a limit on the resources (i.e. computer, label stock, labeling programs) available for use.  Offsite, the producer will have a greater latitude of how to perform the task.

If items are cataloged offsite, NLS does have the capability of importing MARC records.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education anticipates that a sole-source contract will be awarded
to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to facilitate the ?Evaluation of the National
Assessment of Educational Progress.?  To perform the evaluation as required by the ?No Child Left Behind Act of 2001? [SEC. 411(f)(1)(a) and (b)], the National Center for Educational Statistics requires a prestigious, authoritative, nationally respected organization with direct access to experts in the field of large-scale educational assessment, including psychometricians and subject matter specialists, experience in convening panels, and a proven ability to produce influential and credible reports.  The organization must be known for its objectivity, and its reputation must transcend any appearance of political influence or advocacy.  

NAS is composed of individuals of exceptional ability and distinguished reputation in the front ranks of their professions.  Inherent in the work of NAS are its on-going activities in education.  It operates through the use of panels of highly respected experts from many fields and academic disciplines, all of whom are recruited pro bono.  Specifically, NAS is able to call on The Board on Testing and Assessment, a prominent entity within its organization.  Its history in using panels to examine educational research in the field of large-scale assessments reinforces NAS? ability, credibility, and uniqueness to do the proposed work.  The rigorous peer review process and vetting of reports, exclusive to NAS, provides a weight that no other organization can provide.  Accordingly, it is NAS to which Congress and the public generally turn regarding especially controversial issues where the authoritative judgment of the best scientists and experts is required.   Therefore, the National Center for Educational Statistics has identified NAS as the only organization that meets its requirements.  

Any organization that considers itself qualified to perform this procurement should submit a capability statement outlining its qualifications to Isadora Binder, Contract Specialist, by 5:00 P.M. EST on Monday, 5/27/2002.  Two hard copies of the capability statement must be submitted.

<DESC>Advanced Technology Platform for CMS Claims Processing -- Sources Sought Notice

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking sources to develop modern systems for the automated administration and support of its claims processing and associated functions.  The following features that differentiate this platform from currently deployed technology shall characterize the advanced system.

1. The system shall be based on a fully articulated model of entities and relationships that represent the semantics of the CMS Health Care programs.  This model shall be furnished as part of the product and be configurable to accommodate future changes to those programs.  This model shall be an active model such that the components defined within it are used directly in the definition of the execution mapping which actually drives the logic path for the computer.

2. The system shall feature a high-level English oriented language that is semantically specific to the Health Care Industry.  This language shall be suitable for defining Medicare and Medicaid regulations, directives and manual procedures by business analysts having no previous computer programming experience.  This language shall be translatable directly to the definition of the execution mapping which actually drives the logic path for the computer.  

3. The system shall create modular execution maps that define major business functions such as claims adjudication.  These execution maps shall be formed by combining attributes and methods found within the formalized system model and the high-level English oriented language.  These execution maps shall be easily maintainable and interactively updateable.  These execution maps shall not rely upon the third generation edit-compile-link-debug-edit cycle.

4. The system shall support the generation of commercial quality programmatic notices, such as Medicare Summary Notices, directly from the high-level English oriented language described in Item 2 above. 

5. The system shall feature integrated version control that tracks all changes.

6. The system shall be developed using open, portable technology standards.  The system is required to run on both mid-tier (Unix) platforms as well as mainframe (IBM OS//390) platforms.

7. The system shall use Internet technology to enable the user interface.

8. The system shall support near-real time replication of online transactions to data warehousing processors for the support of multi-tier information retrieval requirements.

CMS plans to acquire this technology platform to support a proof of concept project that must be completed within calendar year 2002.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposal but a Request for Information to locate potential sources for a COTS farm business planning tool for the Farm Service Agency (FSA) an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  FSA has a need for moving their direct loan application process to the Internet.  The mission of FSA's farm loan program is to provide temporary financial and supervisory assistance to farmers and ranchers who have realistic chances of success. The Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1989 (GPEA) mandates government agencies to provide individuals and entities the option to submit information, transact business and maintain records electronically as an alternative to the manual forms based process by October 2003. FSA has identified the need to replace their existing PC Based Farm and Home Plan system (FHP) with a web based COTS farm business planning tool.  The FHP is an accrual business plan that reflects up to 5 years of history.  The plans include farm, capital and family expenses, production information and all income generate on and off the farm.  In addition to the business plan, the system also generates a balance sheet listing all current, intermediate and long term assets and liabilities.  FHP generates the form FSA 431-2, Farm and Home Plan, a listing of equipment and livestock, a 5-year history report, and B classification report.  The new on line system must be equivalent to the in data currently collected in FHP.  The on line system shall empower producers to complete their farm business plans on the web and submit them electronically to the service center this will allow USDA Service Center employees the capability to assist producers in completing their business plans. The on line system will allow the producer to work at their home where information related to their operation is readily available.  Also the system must have the capability to allow the FSA employees to work from the USDA Service Center. The on line application shall be a component of the agency's loan making/servicing process. Data collected by the application must be electronically uploaded to the existing agency databases. Also the software must have the capability to read the FLP database to retrieve the current FHP. The data elements will be defined by USDA and included in the contract. This capability is necessary to allow USDA to have a five-year history of the individuals and give us the capability to produce nationwide reports for management. The Farm Service Agency has a technical requirement that all software placed on a PC in the Service Center must pass the Common Computing Center testing requirements. Only firms that currently have software product(s) possessing the above characteristics are invited to response to the RFI.  Responses should include: (1) Two (2) copies of all technical documentation, limited to twenty (20) pages, which address each of the above described characteristics and any other important technical aspects of the product.  (2) Commercial price list or GSA schedule for license and maintenance fees software (3) Points of contact (including name e-mail address, phone number and fax number) from three customers currently using the identified product.  This is an RFI and not a request for comments or a request for proposals.  Nothing shall be constructed herein or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this RFI.  Firms responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and shall not be returned to the submitter.  To be considered, responses must be received with fifteen (15) calendar days of the publication of this announcement.  Written responses to this notice are to directed to Delia Downer, USDA, FSA, TSD, 6501 Beacon, Kansas City, MO 64133. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.

Potential offerors shall be able to prepare the following virus suspensions and associated services as requested by the project Officer:
1.	Paramyxoviruses.   Prepare 1-2 liters of four (4) suspensions of wild type or attenuated parainfluenza or respiratory syncytial virus per year in (i) human or simian diploid cells such as FRhL cells or (ii) heteroploid cells such as Vero cells that have been qualified for use in the production of a live virus vaccine for administration to humans as currently recommended by the FDA.  These viruses shall include human wild type, temperature sensitive (ts) and cold adapted (ca) viruses, and viruses derived using recombinant DNA technology.  Produce and test these viruses as described above and ensure that they have an infectivity of 10 to the power of 6 or greater for parainfluenza viruses and 10 to the power of 5 or greater for respiratory syncytial virus. Vaccine candidates for the recently described human metapneumoviruses might also need to be made.
2.	Rotavirus.  Prepare 2-3 liters of three (3) rotavirus suspensions each year in cell cultures of primary or secondary African green monkey kidney (demonstrated previously to be free of simian adventitious agents) or in human or simian cells suitable for production of vaccines intended for use in humans.  Aliquot virus suspensions which (a) have acceptable infectivity, i.e., 10 to the power of 6 pfu per ml titered in MA104 cells or other suitable infectivity titers as determined by the Project Officer and (b) retain the identity of the rotavirus supplied by the Project Officer.
3.	Hepatitis.  Each year, distribute up to two (2) different suspensions of non-living hepatitis virus vaccine (eg., inactivated whole virus vaccine or virus like particles prepared by recombinant DNA technology) into vials and perform final container safety test for sterility and general animal safety.  In addition, prepare 2-3 liters of two (2) virus suspensions of candidate live attenuated hepatitis virus vaccines per year.  It may be necessary to clone and characterize selected tissue culture cells for their usefulness as substrates for hepatitis virus vaccine production.
4.	Vaccinia Viruses.  Prepare about 500 ml of 2 preparations per year of recombinant vaccinia virus, primarily a derivative of MVA (Modified Vaccinia Ankara), bearing an insert of a gene of interest to NIAID scientists (e.g., the G and F glycoproteins of respiratory syncytial virus or the E protein of dengue virus) for studies in humans.  Produce such candidate virus vaccines in cells derived from avian species suitable for use in preparation of viruses destined for use in humans.  Ensure that each preparation has a virus titer of approximately 10 to the power of 8.5-9.0 pfu/ml.
5.	Dengue viruses.  Prepare 2-3 liters of three (3) wild type or live attenuated dengue virus per year in Vero or other cells qualified for use in preparing vaccines for administration to humans.  Viruses will be supplied by the Project Officer in the form of DNA-derived viruses recovered from transfected C6/36 mosquito cells or Vero cells.  The viruses will be amplified and cloned in Vero or another cell line qualified for use in the preparation of viruses to be given to humans.  Ensure that the viral preparations have an infectivity of 10 to the power of 5.0-6.0 or greater.  The viruses are to be administered parenterally and should contain no serum or antibiotics.  The amount and size of cell DNA that contaminates the vaccine should meet FDA requirements for parenterally administered vaccine preparations prepared in cell lines such as Vero cells.
6.	Caliciviruses.  Prepare two (2) suspensions of recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) per year for calicivirus reference strains of interest.  The VLPs will be purified from the culture fluids of insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing the capsid protein of human calicivirus strains such as the Hawaii, Toronto, and Desert Shield viruses.  Approximately 50 mg of purified VLP protein for each virus strain will be needed for use in diagnostic assays.  Safety testing of these diagnostic reagents will not be required.  In addition, VLPs will be purified for evaluation as vaccine candidates. Approximately two (2) preparations of 10-30 mg of VLP for administration to humans will be made per year.  Prepare one (1) challenge virus suspension per year derived from a stool filtrate according to tests required by FDA for biological materials suitable for administration to humans.
7.	Influenza Viruses.  Prepare (2) virus suspension of 2-3 liters of influenza virus in embryonated chicken eggs obtained from specific pathogen free flocks and safety test these suspensions during each contract year.  These viruses include wild type and attenuated influenza virus of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes or other subtypes as they appear in nature.  Seed virus will be provided by the Project Officer.  The suspensions shall be grown in SPAFAS avian leucosis virus-free embryonated eggs.  The final product shall be tested for freedom from avian leucosis virus and other adventitious microbial agents.  The viral suspensions shall (a) have requisite infectivity, i.e., 10 to the power of 7.5 to 10 to the power of 8.0 plaque forming units (pfu) per ml measured on MDCK cell culture monolayers in the presence of ~1 ug of trypsin per ml and (b) retain the laboratory markers of the attenuated seed virus such as high efficiency of plaque formation at low temperature (ca phenotype) or decreased efficiency of plaque formation at high temperature (ts phenotype).
8.	Provide documentation for all animal derived raw materials used in the manufacture of these virus suspensions including country of origin and certificates of analysis documenting the quality control tests performed by the vendor.
9.	Store the virus suspensions at -70 degrees C or below and distribute aliquots to laboratory of clinical investigators at the direction of the Project Officer.

<DESC>NA The Jacksonville District of the US Army Corps of Engineers is planning an acquisition for placement of sand along Miami Beach in the vicinity of 63rd Street to 83rd Street using a source of sand provided by the contractor. Approximately 600,000 cubic yard s of material will be required to fill the beach area between monuments DNR-38 to DNR-46.  This segment of beach is approximately 8,300 feet long.  It will have a 205-foot berm width from the Erosion Control Line (ECL) at El. 9 MLW with a foreshore slope o f 1 Vertical on 15 Horizontal.  A 50-foot wide pipeline corridor, centered at 553,290 North, is provided for placement of fill from the offshore.  Any plan to use a large number of trucks hauling material along the local roads of the beaches will not be ac ceptable.  The contractor will establish the sand source for this project, based upon government criteria. The sand must be suitable for Southeast Florida beaches.  It must be free of debris, sharp rocks and pebbles, concrete rubble, and clay.  The average  mean grain size shall be equal to or greater than 0.30 mm. (1.74f) and less than 0.55mm. (0.86f).  The fines must be less than 5% (passing the #200 sieve).  Ninety-nine percent (99%) of the material must pass the 3/8-inch sieve with no particles larger th an -inch diameter.  Sand mineralogy composed predominantly of quartz or calcium carbonate is required.  Sand not hydraulically placed shall be completely saturated to achieve a density comparable to hydraulically placed sand.  The sand shall have a color similar to the existing beach.  Manufactured sand is not environmentally acceptable.  Protection of the environment, especially the existing offshore reef system, is very important.  The Contractors operations will have to be carried out in accordance wit h permit requirements.  It is anticipated that this project may be constructed during the turtle-nesting season and precautions will have to be taken.  The contractor will be expected to provide the necessary permit documents and certificates of compliance  for use of the borrow source.  For further details, the Sand Specification may be viewed at   https://ebs1.saj.usace.army.mil/ebs/AdvertisedSolicitations.asp, under the Plans/Specification tab for Request for Information (RFI) Number DACW17-02-Z-0003.  The purpose of this RFI is to seek industry input regarding upland sand sources, or other possibl e alternatives.  No offshore sand sources shall be an acceptable source.

<DESC>POC:  Brenda Donnelly, fax 703-648-7901; This is not a notice for a solicitation.  This is a Request for Information (RFI). Neither a draft statement of work nor specifications are available.  The information received will be used as part of a market survey.  The US Geological Survey (USGS) requests technical and price information from the vendor community on the operation & maintenance of NT and Sun servers in a Lotus/Domino environment. The scope of services for this anticipated contract is to monitor and manage the hardware, operating system and application server infrastructure for USGS Lotus Notes/Domino.  There are up to 95 servers included in the infrastructure.  

The USGS implemented Lotus/Domino three years ago and has come to rely on this environment for its mail and messaging applications as well as electronic meetings and electronic database management applications.  The USGS has implemented Lotus/Domino across its enterprise and desires to implement additional functionality and capabilities within the Lotus/Domino product environment. 

The major project requirement is to monitor and manage Lotus/Domino.  This will involve monitoring and repairing Lotus/Domino system problems as they occur so that the USGS will realize a stable, reliable infrastructure. To meet these objectives we require expertise and experience managing an environment comparable in technical complexity and size to the USGS with the resources, operational practices, and Lotus/Domino experience to manage this environment. This request is not a formal RFP and NO contract will result from this synopsis.  Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release.  All responses should include three copies of all information submitted and contain sufficient technical documentation and descriptive literature to sufficiently describe hardware requirements and software capabilities.

<DESC>Expression of Interest
Roofing Repairs and Replacements


BWXT Y-12, L.L.C. (BWXT Y-12), acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22800 with the Department of Energy (DOE) is soliciting expressions of interest for roof repairs and  roof replacements for numerous buildings in the Y-12 Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  BWXT Y-12 anticipates that under these two solicitations it will make multiple awards for General Order Agreements (GOA) for two different roofing needs.

The first solicitation includes buildings that are predominately office or warehouse type structures in which the Seller will be required to replace or repair the existing roof, based upon their approved design, and provide a 15 year leak-free manufacturer's warranty.  That warranty must cover all materials and labor, be non-prorated, have a no dollar limit, and include follow-up annual inspections, any maintenance and repair over the life of the warranty.  The warranty shall have 5-year renewable extensions.   BWXT Y-12 intends to award projects that total approximately $1.5 million this fiscal year, ending September 30, 2002, and $1.5 million each year for the next 5 fiscal years.  Base award will be for a 1 year period with options for the next four years.

The second solicitation is for buildings that are predominately production type buildings in which the Seller will be required to replace the existing roof based upon a pre-designed system such as a 4-ply built-up roofing system.  A manufacturer's standard form warranty, without monetary limitations, will be required in which the manufacturer agrees to repair or replace components of the roofing system that fail in materials or workmanship within 20 years from the date of substantial completion.  Failure includes roof leaks.  These buildings will be in the property protection area of the plant and will require more stringent security requirements and may have the potential for encountering various forms of roof contaminants, including radiological contamination.  The Price Anderson Act applies for this work.  BWXT Y-12 intends to award projects in this category in the amount of approximately $3 million this fiscal year and $2.5 million each year for the next 2 fiscal years.  Base award will be for 1 year with an optional two 1 year periods.

As a result of this solicitation for expression of interest, interested parties will be evaluated in future solicitations for Request for Proposals (RFP) based upon criteria that will include such items as work experience, qualifications of personnel, references, work plans, safety plans, QA plans, and price. 

To qualify to submit proposals on each of these solicitations, interested parties will at a minimum be expected to provide the following:

1. Evidence of five (5) years relevant experience in performing roof replacement work.

2. Have aggregate bonding capacity for $5 million.

3. Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of less than 1.04.
(Based upon an average of the past 3 years)

4. Employees who are all United States citizens.
