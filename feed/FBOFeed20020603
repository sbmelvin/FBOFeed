<DESC>The Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida intends to issue a three-year Indefinite Quantity Requirements Contract for the procurement of 227 high- pressure (HP) air storage systems.   The HP air storage systems will be used to support the Special Diver Air Support System (SDASS).    The SDASS is a surface support dive system that consists of an HP composite flask air system certified to 190FSW.  The system provides breathing air for up to three working divers at a maximum depth of 250FSW under extreme conditions. Competition will be limited to Structural Composite Industries in Pomona CA and Luxfer Gas Cylinders in Riverside CA.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons; The HP air storage systems must have a DOT-E-10945 exemption. Additionally, The salient characteristics of the hp cylinders are as follows:  Material  -  Fully wrapped cylinder, carbon fiber exterior over an aluminum core for high pressure air storage. Pressure Rating -  Working pressure of 5000 psig Dimensions –  Length 58 inches/Diameter 14 inches Ports –  Female ports on each end  Threads  -  .875-14 UNF-2B each end Weight –  Maximum empty weight of 180 pounds Internal Volume -   5450 cubic inches water volume, minimum The physical size, weight and operating characteristic of the system components are crucial to providing a U. S. Navy certified SDASS system.  The HP air storage systems must interface with existing equipment that is certified as “Life Support”.  The SDASS system is a certified “life support” system therefore nothing can be altered.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly to the Government for re-certification as well as jeopardize a diver’s safety.  NAICS 339920

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to advise industry for planning and or/preparation purposes of an OMB Circular A-76 Direct Conversion for the Administration of Personnel Data Systems in the Air Force Special Operations Command located at Hurlburt Field FL.   A DRAFT copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is available on the Federal Government?s Electronic Posting System (www.fedbizopps.gov).    It is emphasized that this SOW is merely a DRAFT and various changes may be included in the final SOW once the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) is released.  The Contracting office anticipates issuing a RFP using FAR Parts 12 and 15 for a one-year basic period (includes a two-month transition period) with four (4) one-year option periods.  NAICS Code 541513 is applicable to this effort.   The small business size standard is $18,000,000.  The contract type will be Firm-Fixed Price.  This potential requirement will be 100% set-aside for small business participation. The anticipated issue date is on or about 5 August 2002.  Relevant information regarding a site visit or conference will be announced in a future FedBizOpps posting.  This announcement is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract at this time.  However, the Government believes industry feedback is important and is receptive to any and all comments or questions from industry that would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.  Request that interested parties review the DRAFT SOW and QASP and take this opportunity to submit any comments on the overall content and their relationship to standard commercial practices for this type of operation.   All comments shall be forwarded to 16CONS/LGCY, 350 Tully Street, Hurlburt Field, FL 32544; or via email to Cathina Hill.  Firms responding should indicate if they are small business against the above size standard.  This is a paperless acquisition.  Paper copies of the solicitation will NOT be issued.   A government cost estimate is being developed and a contract may or may not result.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) has a requirement for assistance in developing minority participation in public and private partnerships.  MBDA's mission is to promote the mobilization of activities and resources of State and local governments, business and trade associations, universities, foundations, professional organizations, and volunteer and other groups towards the growth of minority business enterprises, and facilitate the coordination of the efforts of these groups with those of Federal departments and agencies.   MBDA is directed to convene meetings of the heads of Federal departments and agencies whose programs and activities may affect or contribute to the development of minority business enterprise and also to convene business leaders, educators, and other representatives of the private sector who are engaged in assisting the development of minority business enterprise or who could contribute to its development, for the purpose of proposing, evaluating and coordinating governmental and private business development activities.  MBDA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Performance-based Solutions, Inc., to provide the following:  developing  strategies for fostering lasting mutually beneficial private sector partnerships between emerging minority businesses and established successful corporations by working with corporations to encourage the use of existing federal statutes and regulations that provide substantial incentives for the formation of partnerships between successful companies and minority businesses; encouraging matchmaking sessions at planned national conferences and coordination of outreach strategies to encourage maximum attendance by potential participants;  coordinating with offices of the Department of Commerce to promote the use of mentors in federal and corporate purchasing.   The incumbent shall develop strategies to enhance MBDA's participation in dialogues among Office Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization's (OSDBU's), minority business trade associations, chambers of commerce, purchasers and minority-owned businesses by;  participating in meetings and activities involving national trade associations aimed at increasing minority business participation, involving OSDBU's to encourage the participation of minority businesses in the procurements of their respective departments and agencies;  coordination with federal minority small business advocates responsible for ensuring that federal acquisition policies take into consideration the needs and role of minority business and;  coordination with corporate diversity officers and buyers responsible for expanding their supplier and subcontractor bases.  This requirement requires the services of an individual who is exceptionally familiar with the federal and private sector procurement process as it relates to the unique requirements of the minority business community.  This experience must demonstrate an ability to understand the historic barriers to minority business success in obtaining procurements and the capability to work with a broad panorama of minority and majority businesses and minority business advocates to enhance and develop opportunities for this segment of the economy.   Award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for five Absolute Pressure Sensors Gauges and supporting parts. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from MKS Instuments who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  The existing electronic pressure scanning systems in the hypersonics wind tunnels require upgrade.  Due to the complexity of the electronic pressure scanning system and the data acquisition system, it is imperative that the same components be used in all hypersonics wind tunnels to allow for compatibility and interchangeability.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to duplicate this effort and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 13, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<RESPDATE>061702
<ARCHDATE>07022002
<CONTACT>Velinda Nix, Contract Specialist, Phone (312) 751-3387, Fax (312) 751-4923, Email morganve@rrb.gov
<DESC>Section I - Background
The purpose of this project is to provide a replacement system for the Watermark Imaging system currently used by the Board Member?s offices (Office of the Chair - Chair, Office of the Management Member - MMO, and Office of the Labor Member ? LMO) located at 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois (headquarters) and for the Washington Legislative Office, 1310 G Street, NW (WLO ? Washington, DC; remote access).  Watermark is no longer being supported. Based on a review of business requirements, RRB staff has recommended that the replacement system be based on eiStream?s Image Pro.  The RRB presently holds a sufficient number of site licenses for Image Pro.  The Secretary to the Board maintains the files. The files are located on the Board Member's Novell server.  The files are stored on the agency?s LAN in Direct Access Storage Devise (DASD) format.  Watermark files are archived to CD-R media after about 1 year.
The steps that are taken by the Secretary to the Board?s office are as follows:
1.	The documents are scanned into the Watermark system.
2.	The input to the document properties and any user fields and values are added to the documents. There are two types of documents currently in the Watermark system.  These documents and the properties are described in detail in the Document Types section.
3.	The original document is saved to the Novell Server and copies of the document are e-mailed to the three Board Office?s Administrative Assistants. The Secretary can attach notes.  The notes provide additional information such as due dates.
4.	The paper is kept in the Secretary to the Board?s office.
The copies are stored on the office Administrative Assistant?s PC, in Watermark System files. The offices can access the original documents on the server in read-only format.
A flow chart for this process is shown in Attachment A.
Section II - Board Office?s Requirements

All three of the offices have requested that the basic process of the system should remain the same.  Additional enhancements that are desired are as follows:

?	Provide a linkage between the Docketing System and the Imaging System.

?	Incorporate Word documents into the system without scanning the document.

?	Provide a query source to locate documents easily.

?	All Approval items must be converted.  The Informational items will be converted based on the cost of the conversion.

?	Confidentiality of the documents is required.

The following sections provide brief descriptions of the background and current process used with the Watermark system.

Section III - Document Types 
There are two types of documents used in the Board offices: Informational Items and Approval items.    To index a document in Watermark, specific details known collectively as document properties are associated with the document. The document properties can be set when it is created or when an existing document is being saved under a different name.  These properties can also be set at a later time if necessary.  The Application Preference, Set Properties on New, can be set to have to Document Properties dialog box appear automatically when a document is first created

The following sections describe each document type and the associated properties.

Individual Office Documents in Watermark
In addition to the documents forwarded to the offices by the Secretary of the Board, each office has the ability to maintain their own informational documents internally. They are able to set up their Watermark filing system according to their own office specifications.  These documents are stored in the Watermark System files on the server location dedicated to the individual office.  Closed out Approval items are also stored in the server files.  The offices manually enter the vote information in the Docket System. 
The steps taken by the individual offices mirror the ones taken by the Secretary of the Board.  Each office maintains their server files. A flow chart of the office?s process is shown in Attachment B.
The average pages for these documents are 3-5. The categories and document volumes used by the Labor Member?s office are in the Attachment C.  The Management Member?s Office and the Chair?s Office currently do not use this process for their internal documents.
Docket System
A database system is currently being used to store and record votes on the Approval Items scanned into the Watermark system.  The database is a Paradox database and the interface is written in Delphi.  The table structure of the database is in Attachment D. 
Conversion Requirements
The documents are in TIFF format.  The Watermark property information shall be converted to Image Pro?s property format.  All Approval documents must be converted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Government is seeking sources to accomplish forest rehabilitation and remediation for an aircraft mishap site and extraction trail in a remote location approximately 19 miles north of Durango, Colorado.  The mishap site is located in the rugged mountainous terrain of the Hermosa backcountry management area, on the Columbine Ranger District, San Juan National Forest.  The incident aircraft came to rest near the bottom of a small side drainage of Dutch Creek.  To extricate the aircraft, it was partially disassembled, loaded onto a truck bed equipped with skids for pulling across ground/snow, and towed by D-8 crawler tractors.  Various spots along the trail and Dutch Creek Road were widened to permit passage of the sleds and tractors.  The major portion of the constructed temporary access route is approximately 14 feet wide and about 1500 feet long.  Grades are quite steep, ranging from 10-35%.  Cut banks range from 1 foot to 10 feet in height.
  
The anticipated effort will require the contractor to bring equipment to the mishap site and the approximately 1.5-mile long extraction route in order to rehabilitate and remediate the area.   Major goals of the project are: 1) Area clean up to include soil remediation (if necessary), backfilling, and revegetating the area; 2) Restore the ground topography so that it appears to be natural and pristine, flowing with the slope and contour of the surrounding landscape; 3) Ground rehabilitation to remove evidence of past earth moving activities; and 4) Native vegetation rehabilitation.  The Government anticipates the period of performance for the basic effort to be approximately June 28 - July 18, 2002 (21 calendar days) with option periods for follow-up work, if necessary, in the summers of 2003, 2004, and/or 2005.

The Government will conduct a site visit on Monday, June 10, 2002.  Contact Capt Brandon Montler at (505) 846-7947 for time and location details.  Contractors interested in this requirement must notify the Government by 4:00 PM mountain time, Friday, June 7, 2002, and are highly encouraged to attend the site visit to become more familiar with the site and requirements before quote preparation. 

The applicable NAICS for this acquisition is 115310, Forestry Support, and the size standard is $6M.  When notifying the Government of interest in this requirement, please state your business status.  Currently, this acquisition is unrestricted.  However, the Government may reserve this requirement for small business prior to solicitation release. 

A statement of work will be available at the site visit for contractor comment.  The finalized statement of work will be available in the solicitation.

The Government anticipates releasing a combined synopsis and solicitation in accordance with FAR Part 12.603 on or about June 14, 2002.  Prospective contractors will be allowed approximately 7 calendar days to prepare and submit quotes in accordance with the solicitation instructions.  The Government anticipates awarding to a single contractor on a best value basis in accordance with the upcoming solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a five-year contract to Innovative Logistics Technologies, Inc. (INNOLOG), 2110 Corporate Ridge, McLean, VA  22101-7838 for technical and management support to assist with the continuing operations and development of MAXIMO and MAXIMO-related systems.  This will include the continued development and implementation of MAXIMO and MAXFLEET for Facilities Management Services (FMS) and Fleet Management Operations (FMO).  Support will include the creation of a system that will automate the shipping and receiving processes of the Loading Dock at the Harry S. Truman Building and to ensure that technical support is available for ongoing development, maintenance and end user support on new and existing systems.  INNOLOG is the only known company which possesses MAXIMO expertise at the U.S. Department of State.  Other companies that do MAXIMO implementations may have experience with MAXIMO but have no knowledge of the logic, functionality and operation of the MAXIMO systems at the U.S. Department of State.  
INNOLOG is uniquely qualified to perform these services due to the extensive customizations to the MAXIMO software that INNOLOG has made. See note 22.

<DESC>The initial synopsis remains in effect unless otherwise stated in this modification.  The purpose of this modification to the original synopsis is to provide additional information as follows.  This acquisition will be a commercial buy in accordance with FAR Part 12 and will be a partial Small Business Set Aside in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5.  The USCG intends to award three Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity contracts with a minimum guaranteed quantity of one boat each.  At least two of the three initial awards will be set aside for eligible, responsible small business concerns.  The three awards are expected to be made this summer, concurrent with the issuance of the initial delivery order of one boat per contract, the minium guaranteed quantity.  After award, each contractor will be required to produce the boat that they proposed in their written proposal within ninety days after award of the delivery order.  Upon delivery of the three boats, the USCG will test and further evaluate the boats equally to down-select to the one boat (contractor) who is determined to be the best value to the USCG, who will then be the intended recipient of additional orders for the duration of the contract period of performance.  No further orders will be placed with the two remaining contracts.  THE SPECIFICATION FOR THE RESPONSE BOAT-SMALL WILL BE UPLOADED TO THIS WEB SITE AS A RFI (REQUEST FOR INFORMATION). THE SPECIFICATION IS BEING RELEASED (POSTED) FOR INDUSTRY COMMENTS. ALL INTERESTED PARTIES ARE INVITED TO SHARE THEIR COMMENTS REGARDING THE SPECIFICATION BY FORWARDING THE COMMENTS BY EMAIL OR FACSIMILE TO THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY POINTS OF CONTACT STATED HEREIN. IF EMAILING YOUR COMMENTS, PLEASE COPY BOTH MS BOGDEN AND MS DEARING.

<DESC>Computer Resource Specialist Service For The Family Support Center Located At Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland.  Solicitation number FA4416-02-T-0025.  The following has been changed:      (A)   Date for quotes has been extended until 11 Jun 2002, 4:30 p.m. eastern time.  	

(B)  The contractor is required to submit resumes for the people they anticipate will fill the position.  These resumes are required to be submitted with the contractor's quote.  

(C)  The contractor is required to submit present and past performance information for same or similar work, Government or commercial, which has been performed in the past three years.  Three to Five will be sufficient.  This information shall consist of the following:  Contractor Number, Type of Work Performed, Dollar Amount, Location, Valid Point of Contact and phone number.  

(D)  The following additions/changes are made to FAR 52.212-2, which is incorporated by reference (http://farsite.hill.af.mil/): 

The ?blank in paragraph (a) of this provision is completed as follows:


BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in which the offeror?s past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations.  By submission of its? offer in accordance with the instructions provided in this RFQ, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records.  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:

	i.  Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price, including any option prices.  The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated under the following subparagraph B, the completeness, and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.

	ii.  Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek performance information on the lowest priced offerors (usually the lowest four to five quotes) based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Generally, the contracting officer shall not seek information on the evaluated higher priced offers unless it is determined none of the lower priced offers are acceptable for award.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror?s ability to perform the effort described in this quote, based on the offeror?s demonstrated present and past performance.  The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, none, marginal, or unsatisfactory.   Offeror with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating of ?none,? meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.   

	iii.  If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have an exceptional performance risk rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.   Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.
         
        iv.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of ?very good? or lower.  In that event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.

     	v.  Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in this quote.  Offeror?s may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposals (e.g., the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical error will not constitute discussion and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award without the opportunity for proposal revisions.     vi. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussion if deemed it?s best interest.

(E) All prospective offerors interested in submitting a proposal must have a commercial and government entity code (CAGE Code) and be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) at www.ccr2000.com

(F)  Quotes must be received no later than 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on 11 Jun 2002.  Quotes may be mailed to: 89th Contracting Squadron, 1419 Menoher Drive, Andrews AFB, MD 20762 (ATTN: Stacy MacKay).  E-mail quotes will also be acceptable.  E-mail quotes must be sent to Stacy.MacKay@andrews.af.mil .   If quotes are forwarded via facsimile than the offeror must notify Stacy MacKay at (301) 981-2308 or email. 

(G)  Clarifications, questions and answer from the site visit held on 30 May 02 will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunity webpage at www.eps.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to change the Government point of contact for this requirement. Government point of contact is revised from:  Mr. Robert Moorman, 202-231-5050 to:  Mr. Ed Welsh 202-231-2731.  All else remains unchanged.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Virginia Contracting Activity on behalf of the Defense Intelligence Agency, request for proposals in support of the attached Statement of Work for a technological upgrade of the existing turnstiles at Building 6000, 200 MacDill Blvd., Bolling AFB, Washington, DC.  The existing turnstiles use a turnbuckle resistance arm and only provide narrow lanes (24 inches clearance) for the majority of DIA employees and visitors.  Optical turnstiles are a current technology upgrade and meet all current ADA, life safety, and fire safety requirements.  They also reduce the need for constant vigilance of uniformed officers at access and egress points.  Turnstiles provide a necessary Force Protection Service by controlling the flow of personnel, ensuring that properly ?badged? personnel are allowed in and out, and provide additional force protection measures in the event of an emergency.  The current turnstiles do not provide adequate force protection measures.  The proposed upgrade of DIAC turnstiles is necessary to bring this equipment to the current state-of-the-art technology.  Each of the 8 lanes will meet fire safety, life safety, and ADA requirements.  A Firm Fixed-Price award will be issued to the offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government (Best Value), on the basis of technical approach, expertise/experience and cost. Technical approach and expertise/experience are significantly more important than cost.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular, FAC 01-06.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Offerors should submit their responses IAW the directions in the attached RFP document.  The Request for Quotation has the Statement of Work can be accessed at this site under MDA908-02-Q-0141. 

Bid should be submitted via email at:  jill.kline@dia.mil;   Subject line MUST read: MDA908-02-Q-0141 or Faxed to 202-231-2831. Offerors are responsible for confirming that submissions were received by the contracting office before bid closing.

<DESC>IT IS A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CONTRACTOR BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION PRIOR TO AWARD OF THE CONTRACT.  The work includes furnishing all labor, materials, supervision, equipment, tools, permits, training, certifications, and licenses necessary to provide servicing of waste oil accumulation points and oil/water separators, transport and disposal of waste oil, and other waste oil management services at the Coastal Systems Station in Panama City, FL.  These services include, but are not limited to performing scheduled and on-call waste collection; field testing and classification; hazardous and non-hazardous oily waste; operation of oil/water separators and oil waste dump stations; servicing ships at pierside hotel stations to include maintaining the hotel stations and pierside utility boxes at dockside; and groundwater monitoring well inspection and bailing.  The resultant contract will be a combination firm fixed price and indefinite quantity service type contract.  The contract award will be for a period of twelve months with four additional option periods not to exceed a total of 60 months.  Contract award will be based on the evaluation of two factors:  (1)  the offeror's price and (2) the offeror's recent relevant past performance.  Price is considered relatively more important than past performance.  However, the selection decision will depend on the marginal differences among the competing offers, which will not be known until after all the offers have been received and compared with each other.  The offeror's price and past performance information will be used to evaluate which offer is the best overall value to the Government.   Price Evaluation:  The price competitiveness of each offer will be evaluated by comparing each offeror's prices for the solicitation.  Past Performance Evaluation:  The Navy will review information about the offeror's past performance within the last five years on work that is similar to this solicitation in size, scope, and complexity.  More recent and relevant experience may be viewed more favorably.  Past performance includes the degree by which the offeror has satisfied its customers by delivering quality work in a timely manner at a reasonable total cost.  It also includes the offeror's reputation for integrity, reasonable and cooperative conduct, and commitment to customer satisfaction.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all quotes at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any and all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest price; and to award a contract to the offeror submitting the quote determined to be the most advantageous to the Government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE QUOTES RECEIVED.  THEREFORE, QUOTES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED ON THE MOST FAVORABLE TERMS FROM A PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE STANDPOINT WHICH THE OFFEROR CAN SUBMIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.  OFFERORS SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT THEY WILL BE CONTACTED OR AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO QUALIFY, DISCUSS, OR REVISE THE QUOTE.  The NAICCS Code is 562111 ($6M).  This Solicitation is unrestricted with 10% price evaluation preference for Hub-Zone Small Business Concerns.

<DESC>1. Supervisory Controls

	The Health, Population & Nutrition Specialist (HPNS) is supervised by the SA?DE+ Team Leader and performs under general instructions and guidance from his/her supervisor.  Once general responsibilities and assignments are agreed upon, the Specialist is required to exercise extensive technical and professional judgment in organizing, planning and supervising child survival and reproductive health implementation activities.  This includes identifying the approaches to be taken, resolving problems and conflicts, and meeting deadlines.  The incumbent is required to work with minimum supervision and in collaboration with other offices of USAID/Mozambique, other donors and Ministry of Health (MOH) professionals.  The HPNS is responsible for keeping his/her supervisor appraised of implementation issues related to child survival and reproductive health, and actions to be taken to overcome difficulties and achieve meaningful and quantifiable results.  Completed work is not expected to require substantive modification.  The HPNS?s responsibilities require considerable situational assessment, interpretation, judgment, and timely decision making.  S/he will engage mid- to high-level government officials in policy dialogue regarding matters pertaining to the Mission?s child survival and reproductive health portfolio, including Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI), infectious disease initiatives (polio, malaria), family planning, safe motherhood and integrated maternal and childhood disease control issues.  The HPNS will be primarily responsible for identifying, analyzing, formulating and implementing child survival, infectious disease and family planning and reproductive health programs and activities.  These could include designing, describing and quantifying expected results and performance indicators; providing guidance to implementing partners in making necessary adjustments to program and administrative plans; and preparation of precise, accurate, articulate, complete and professionally written technical documents and program descriptions. 

2. Introduction

	Since the end of the civil war in 1992 and the signing of the peace accords in 1994, Mozambique has been struggling to reestablish its rural health care network destroyed during the war.  It is also trying to establish an adequate management system for the health services; the health service is constrained by high levels of infectious diseases, malnutrition, HIV/AIDS, and limited number of trained health personnel.  USAID continues to be at the forefront in ensuring that services are available to the rural poor where more than 85% of Mozambicans reside.  Since 1998, the USAID has been working to strengthen the ability of the Ministry of Health to deliver essential primary health care at fixed facilities, while U.S. PVOs complement MOH services with community outreach.  USAID?s activities cover more than half of all districts in the country and provide services to an estimated 11.3 million people, including over 2.1 million women of child bearing age and 900,000 children under five years of age.  Currently, over 60% of Mozambicans in these districts (compared to <25% in 1992) now have access to health services.  However, quality remains a concern as staff in many rural facilities have only rudimentary education.  There are only 70 secondary schools in the country and more than 65% of these are located in Maputo, the capital. The MOH employs approximately 18,000 persons at the elementary (52%), basic (29%), intermediate (13%), specialized-intermediate (2.5%), and superior (3.5%) levels.  The elementary level requires no schooling, the basic level requires 3 years of schooling, intermediate level requires 6 years of schooling, and the superior level requires a university degree.  Only a tiny fraction of the 18,000 MOH employees are in the non-clinical professional or administrative classifications.  There are 81 hospital administratorsat the elementary level, 149 at the basic level, 158 at the intermediate level and 12 at the superior (with a bachelor?s degree) level; there are only 16 accountants in the MOH service.  There are only 400 physicians in Mozambique, of whom 25% are specialists.  Mozambique has one of the lowest ratios of doctors to patients in the world (1:35,000).  Most physicians are recent graduates with little public health experience.  For many years to come, Mozambique will continue to rely on foreign talent to help it operate its public health system.  USAID is committed to training Mozambicans to be able to assume more leadership roles in the future through mentoring of junior level personnel.  SAUDE+ has employed a senior level FSN-10 to be mentored by the HPNS for a period of two years, after which it is hoped that the FSN can assume a higher level of responsibility. 

	The HPNS is directly responsible for achieving results associated with child survival and reproductive health under the health (SAUDE+) program.  These are two major activities that were once separate.  In 2000, however, the Mission made a conscious decision to integrate the implementation of these two programs to conform to the MOH structure. S/he provides technical support on child survival and reproductive health issues, as well as STDs and HIV/AIDS.  S/he will also mentor some SAUDE+ staff as possible replacement in the near future.  In this regard, the HPNS performs a wide range and variety of duties of substantial complexity, including consultative, advisory, and monitoring, management, information gathering, processing, and reporting of program performance and accomplishments.  The incumbent provides vital liaison services with Mozambique's professional health community, including the entire spectrum of medical and paramedical personnel, and is responsible for staying abreast of technical developments in the areas of child survival, nutrition and reproductive health. 

	The SA?DE+ portfolio will be approximately $108 million over a six-year period.  The HPNS plays an integral role in the design of all activities related to child survival and reproductive health project documents and the design and management of new activities financed thereunder.  The incumbent will manage certain implementation contracts and awards to non-government organizations working under the SAUDE+ program, as assigned by the Team Leader and Contracting Officer.  In addition, s/he will be responsible for coordinating USAID/Washington-supported projects assigned by the Team Leader.  The HPNS will be called upon to provide technical support as a technical backup for the design and implementation of the Health Sector Support Project or other SAUDE+ activities in the absence of other SAUDE+ team members.  Additional activities will be assigned as additional funding becomes available and SA?DE+ roles and assignments are modified in light of changing circumstances.

A six foot rotatable load table and an interlocked containment structure complete the system. The system is designed for the size reduction of transuranic contaminated large metal objects, such as gloveboxes, pipes, reactors, ductwork, etc.
The commercial partner should have significant experience with various size reduction techniques and technologies. Specific experience in the size reduction of radioactively-contaminated metallic objects, such as gloveboxes, tanks, piping, will be given preference. Specific experience in the control of work activities in Pu-contaminated environments, such as critically control, ventilation control, contamination control, personal protection, procedure compliance, etc. is desirable. Previous experience at major DOE sites assisting with decontamination, decommissioning, dismantlement, and disposal for stabilization of nuclear facilities is highly desirable.

<CONTACT>Jerri Medeiros, (916) 557-7934
<DESC>NA NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLICIT WITH ONE SOURCE—NO SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE.  SYNOPSIS:  The USACE will be replacing two existing railroad bridges owned by Union Pacific Railroad Company (UPRR) as part of the Guadalupe River Flood Control Project in down town San Jose, California. UASCE is also in the midst of a design review with UPRR of a large flood bypass culvert that passes underneath two UPRR rail lines as well as coordinating an agreement with UPRR on the bridge replacement.   The scope of services required for this effort includes providing senior technical support to the USACE during negotiations with UPRR, providing technical guidance and senior technical review for bridge design submittals to UPRR, developing alternatives to  satisfy potentially conflicting requirements of flood control, environmental protection, public access to the river, safety, and ongoing railroad operations.   The work will be awarded sole source to Kirby Consultants, LLC, a small business located in Berkeley, California, because of the expertise of Mr. Robert C. Kirby, PE, a Registered Civil Engineer with over 30 years of experience.  Mr. Kirby has extensive kn owledge of the project requirements, and has the experience working with UPRR personnel on the bridge replacement agreement and the flood bypass culvert aspects during the last two years.  Mr. Kirby has extensive knowledge on how the  UPRR’s design review process relates specifically to this project, and his ability to combine the design requirements of deep soil mixing, temporary tieback systems, steel structure construction, track alignment requirements, UPRR operational restrictions, environmental restri ctions, hazardous material abatement, and recreation/maintenance trail impacts to develop an acceptable solution  to UPRR is unmatched.  His relationships with the UPRR reviewers are essential in keeping the review on schedule.  Bringing on a new consultan t, to get familiarized with the entire project background then provide the same level of service would delay the project by several months.  Because of the tight design and construction schedule, this delay would result in unacceptable delays in the Corps’  commitment to the community to provide flood protection by December 2004. Any delay past the December 2004 completion date would put downtown San Jose at risk for an additional flood season.   All interested parties may respond by submitting a statement of qualifications.  This qualification must include experience and expertise in coordinating design reviews with UPRR’s Roseville and Omaha offices, railroad track design and construction and rai lroad bridge design construction.  This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations.  The Government will consider responses received within 10 days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  All responses are due not later than 13 Jun 0 2/3:00 p.m.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is within the discretion of the Government.   This Procurement will be conducted under FSC Code: C211, SIC Code: 8711, NAICS Code: 541330.  The size standard for this code is $4,000,000.00.  All questions should be directed to the Contracting Specialist, SHIRLEY MARTIN, at (916) 557-6902, FAX (916) 55 7-5278, email Shirley.A.Martin@usace.army.mil; technical questions should be addressed to STAN HO, at (916) 557-6677, FAX  (916) 557-7846, email Stanley.Ho@usace.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>U -- Education Services in Survey Methodology
<DESC>The Census Bureau intends to extend on a sole source basis contract 50-YABC-0-66009 with the University of Maryland.  The extension will be for an additional twelve (12) months to continue to provide services to manage and develop education programs in survey methodology under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   This requirement is for the continuation of the five-year master and doctoral degree programs.  The University of Maryland (UM) has been providing the Census Bureau with a curriculum of courses specialized in the field of survey research and methodology.  These services continue to be required to meet the Census Bureau's need for training professionals in the emerging inter disciplinary field of survey research and methodology.  The extension consists of an additional one-year option to the current contract. The services provided under this contract require an inherent knowledge and expertise of survey methodology, theories and practices in probability and statistics.  The Government has determined that award through competition would require a substantial duplication of the cost that would not be recovered through competition and would create an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the Census Bureau mission.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau needs.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE ITS INVENTION OF HIGH THROUGHPUT PROTEIN CRYSTALLIZATION SYSTEM

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's invention of a high throughput protein crystallization system.  The technology enables comprehensive crystallization screens for approximately eight (8) protein samples a day.  Protein samples are first prescreened and the concentration is adjusted to obtain optimum concentration for crystallization screening.  The protein is then subjected to a set of special screening conditions generated by software tools (CRYSTOOL) and setup with a liquid handling robot.  Typically, these screening conditions are set up in a 96-well deep well block and stored for later use.  Four blocks, or screens, of the conditions are usually sufficient for a comprehensive screening for a new protein.  After crystal-screening conditions are set up in crystallization experiments with a protein of interest, a robotic CCD microscope views the samples at regular intervals.  Images of each crystallization trial are taken and analyzed by a LLNL's proprietary, highly effective, crystal detection system to identify wells containing crystals.  Secondary review and confirmation of crystallogenesis is done by visual inspection of the acquired images. It often occurs that diffraction quality crystals are obtained from initial screens but information derived from initial screening experiments may also be used to optimize crystal formation and to harvest crystals for diffraction studies.  LLNL is in the process of filing patent applications and registering copyrights for the technology.  LLNL is looking for industrial partners to commercialize one or more applications of this invention.  Licenses to software for generating special screening conditions, or for crystal detection systems are available.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's high throughput protein crystallization system should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Companies interested in an end-user license for LLNL's software should also provide a written statement of interest. Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO02-015-302

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's high throughput protein crystallization system.
