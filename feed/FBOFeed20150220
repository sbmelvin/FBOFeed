<a href="mailto:travis.james3@us.army.mil">Travis James</a>
<DESC><br/>Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS)<br/><br/>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Picatinny, on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for manufacturing the XM153, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS), recapitalization of the previously delivered XM153 CROWS, engineering and logistics services, and spares parts. <br/><br/>The CROWS is a multivehicle externally mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing a variety of crew served weapons.  The CROWS provides remote day and night sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move. The major CROWS sub-assemblies include: Fire Control Unit, Control Grip, Main Frame Assy, Right Side Support Assy, Left Side Support Assy, Servo Sight Assy, Thermal Imaging Module, Visual Imaging Module, Soft Mount, Cocking Actuator, Laser Range Finder, Ammo Box Assy, Weapon Adaption Kits, Cables, and Cover.  This list is not intended to be all inclusive.  <br/><br/>The Government has determined that a Full and Open Competition Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract will be utilized for the CROWS requirement.  The expected contract duration is five (5) years. Orders will be issued against the IDIQ contract(s) under three (3) separate and distinct areas of its Statement of Work (SOW).  Each area will have a different contract type associated with it.  The three (3) areas of the SOW and the three (3) planned contract types associated with each one for this requirement are as follows:<br/><br/>I. Fixed-Price, IDIQ: To support production of a maximum of 18,000 CROWS, field maintenance support, and spares.  The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 300 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 500 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Fixed-Price Incentive, IDIQ:  To support product improvements, integrations, and testing.  Share line will be 50/50 with 120 percent ceiling as a point of departure. <br/><br/>III. Firm-Fixed-Price Level-of-Effort, IDIQ:  To support training, overhaul, depot-level maintenance and recapitalization of CROWS; and for general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification will consist of performance requirements and will specify technical drawings.  The detail specification will specify the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and/or how the items are to be fabricated or constructed.  Some sub-assemblies will not include technical drawings and assembly procedures.  Instead, data for those sub-assemblies will include directed source(s) or build-to-spec requirements or both. This approach will ensure a very high level of commonality between multiple CROWS producers and commonality/interchangeability with the existing CROWS fleet.  The Government will provide the aforementioned data on a Digital Video Disc (DVD).  Most data will be in a Portable Data Format (pdf) format but some data may be provided in other formats. <br/><br/>Below is a list of items that are planned to be provided as part of the formal solicitation but will not be included in the draft solicitation release:<br/><br/>Detail Specification<br/>   -     Performance requirements<br/>   -     Technical Drawings<br/>   -     Specifications and Interface Control Documents for those components for which detailed technical drawings are not provided.<br/>   -     Solid models for castings including machining drawings<br/>   -     Gerber formatted printed circuit board layouts with pick and place data<br/>   -     Assembly procedures<br/>   -     List of approved sources for sub-assemblies at various levels of production build <br/>   -     Quality requirements <br/>   -     Test requirements<br/>   -     Executable software files<br/><br/>The software code and associated documentation will not be provided at any time nor will Contractors have access to the data. Only the executable software files will be provided. The software code will be managed by the US Government. Any software changes required in the execution of the contract will be handled utilizing a software change process between the US Government and Contractor(s). <br/><br/>The design/production data described above will be available after Request for Proposal release upon request provided that all necessary paper work is properly completed by the requester, submitted, and approved prior to any release.  <br/><br/>For U.S. & Canadian Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (U.S. & Canada) must complete and submit a DD2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire, and Non-Disclosure Agreement which will be provided. The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced. <br/><br/>For Other Foreign Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (Other Foreign) must complete and submit a AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire and a Non-Disclosure Agreement which will be provided and also be compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced.  <br/><br/>This announcement serves as notification that export control procedures regulated by the ITAR are in effect on the above stated data. Contractors that are interested in receiving this data must be in compliance with the ITAR and possess the proper authorities to receive this data and are encouraged to do so as soon as possible.  The data will be marked Distribution Statement  B  Distribution authorized to U.S. Government agencies only.   All other requests for this data shall be referred to Project Manager Soldier Weapons.

Please reference the following link consulting these regulations http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html.  The Contractors responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided above.<br/><br/>After contract award, the contractors will be provided Government-Furnished Materiel (GFM) to help validate interfaces and qualify suppliers. The GFM may include full up XM153 CROWS systems, select parts and weapons. Contractors must make the appropriate accommodations to be approved for handling and storage of weapons. Government support may be provided to assist in understanding the setup and use of the XM153 CROWS and its operation following contract award. <br/><br/>The present schedule projects a release of a draft solicitation on or about 3QFY11.  An Industry Day will be announced during the draft solicitation release and further details shall be posted on FedBizOpps.gov (https://www.fbo.gov/).

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Edgewood Contracting Division intends to negotiate with MRIGlobal, Inc., 425 Volker  <br> Blvd Kansas City, MO 64110 under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i), for maintenance/sustainment of the Individual Protection Ensemble Mannequin System(IPEMS) facility at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah. The IPEMS was designed, developed and installed at DPG by MRIGlobal under competitively awarded  <br> contract. <br>  <br> MRIGlobal designed IPEMS as a highly specialized unique system which is in the component level verification stage of development and consists of an  <br> integrated IPE Mannequin, exposure chamber, and control room.  Since the IPEMS is incomplete, and the required maintenance program has not been fully developed, the Government requires a contractor familiar with this highly specialized one-of-a-kind system to perform the maintenance during FY2015. Currently, the Government does not have trained individuals on site at DPG with operational knowledge and experience to properly sustain the IPEMS facility. Purchase Order award is anticipated no later than 05 December 2014.   <br>  <br> This is not a request for quote.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas.

<CONTACT>Robin Jones, Email robin.jones@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to issue sole-source solicitations to Computer Sciences Corporation and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC&nbsp;to maintain continuity of services at DHS Data Centers 1 and 2 during&nbsp;DHS's transition to the Enterprise Computing Services (ECS) model of data center support. DHS anticipates awarding&nbsp;the resultant contract for support at Data Center 1 to Computer Sciences Corporation&nbsp;in&nbsp;June 2015 with&nbsp;a six month base period of performance and four (4) 12 month option periods beginning on&nbsp;January&nbsp;1, 2016. DHS anticipates awarding the resultant contract for support at Data Center 2 to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC in&nbsp;March 2015 with a base year period of performance and four (4) 12 month option periods beginning in June 2015.<br /><br />DHS is continuing its transition from&nbsp;its existing&nbsp;data center support model to the ECS model as described in the Special Notice posted with a&nbsp;tracking number of HSHQDC-15-ECS. DHS awarded the competitive ECS Independent Validation and Verification contract in December 2014 and is actively developing the requirements for the remaining ECS pilot, proof of concept, and prototype&nbsp;acquisitions. The ECS pilot, proof of concept, and prototype&nbsp;acquisitions are anticipated to last from six months to three years each. Based on the Department's&nbsp;projections, transitioning to the new ECS model of support&nbsp;will take up to two years following the conclusion of the pilot, proof of concept, and prototype&nbsp;acquisitions, which necessitates the sole source action described in this notice (please refer to the aforementioned FedBizOpps Special Notice HSHQDC-15-ECS).<br /><br />DHS Data Center 1 is government owned and has been contractor operated by Computer Sciences Corporation since July 2008 under task order HSHQDC-06-D-00021/HSHQDC-08-J-00169. DHS Data Center 2 has been contractor owned and operated by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC since September 2007 under task order HSHQDC-06-D-00032/HSHQDC-07-J-00515.&nbsp;Both task orders were competitively awarded via DHS's Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions (EAGLE) multiple award contract. Issuing sole-source solicitations and contracts to Computer Sciences Corporation and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC to continue services during the ECS transition process is necessary to maintain continuity of mission critical services. A break in or disruption of service due to a rushed transition would have catastrophic impact on the Department's mission and the safety of the American public. The contemplated sole source contracts will provide uninterrupted support during the ECS pilot, proof of concept, and prototype&nbsp;period to allow for transition to&nbsp;the competitively awarded ECS solution.&nbsp;<br /><br />The proposed contract actions&nbsp;are for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contracts based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct competitive procurements.<br /><br />A Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) will be posted within 15 days&nbsp;after the first contract award.

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought
<p>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Englewood, CO, that will be expiring and is considering remaining in the space under a succeeding lease under GSAR 570.402, but is interested in considering alternative space that meets the Government's requirements if such alternative space would be economically advantageous.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">7. Subject: The purpose of digitizing the films/plates from the US nuclear weapons above-ground tests is to capture the data in an ageless medium that allows for 1) duplication without any loss of fidelity, and 2) exploitation of data using computing power available today. These films/plates are currently stored in the archives at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). However, since film is made from organic substances its life expectancy is about 100 years. Hence, regardless of how well a film/plate is cared for, it will deteriorate with age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior to digitizing the films/plates, the films must be cleaned, leaders and tails added to films, identified, categorized, and films environmentally deformed must be flattened without data distortion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These films provide data to validate nuclear weapons computer models and facilitate understanding of weapon outputs to support DoD agencies, the military services, and operational commands. Of particular interest are fireball, shock wave, thermal pulse, early-, late- and dust-cloud evolution to aid in modeling as appropriate for 1D/2D simulations.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">8. Description of the efforts needed are included in the attached Statements of Work (SOW) for Film Preparation and Film Digitization. The AFNWC/PZIE intends to either award one contract for the preparation and digitization of the films as stated in the SOWs or will award two separate contracts, one for the preparation and one for the digitization efforts. The work to be performed in the SOWs is unclassified.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">9. Foreign owned firms are advised they may be precluded from submitting a SOC. These firms are advised to contact the Contracting Point of Contact or Technical Point of Contact before submitting a SOC. These positions require employees to be United States Citizens.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Restriction on performance by foreign citizens (i.e., those holding non-U.S. Passports): This topic is "Export-controlled". The information and materials provided pursuant to or resulting from this topic are restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. Parts 120 - 130 or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 C.F.R. Parts 730 - 774, which control the export of sensitive technical data. Foreign Citizens may perform work under an unclassified award resulting from this topic only if they are designated as a US Person, as defined by 22 CFR &sect; 120.15 or if bidder is able to obtain an export license through the Department of State or Department of Commerce. Foreign Citizens designated as US Persons are not permitted to perform work under a classified award. Foreign citizens will at no time be allowed to work on Air Force installations.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">10. Technology developed under the subject program may be subject to U.S. export-control laws and regulations. These laws restrict the transfer, by any means, of certain types of items, information and technology to unauthorized persons. The award of a government contract does not negate the contractor's responsibility to comply with export control requirements under the Arms Export Control Act (Department of State) or the Export Administration Regulations (Department of Commerce). Potential security risks/export violations may occur when contractors employ foreign nationals or outsource portions of the contract's statement of work. The transfer of sensitive or critical unclassified technology to a foreign national without an approved export license is a violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act.</span></p>

<DESC>The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center at Kirtland AFB&nbsp;is considering 6 additional months of service and adding within scope effort of updating manuals to FA9401-13-C-0012, AEM. The current contractor is AEM Services, Inc. 1785 Queen Palm Way, North Port, FL 34288-8655. The period of performance will be extended by six months from 2 APR 13 - 1 APR 15 to 2 APR 13 - 30 SEP 15.
<p>The fundamental objective of this effort is for the contractor to provide technical support to the Arsenal Exchange Model (AEM), update all model documentation, and provide training to government personnel in the use of AEM. The contractor will also be required to assist government personnel in performing analysis with AEM. Some travel will be required. The Contractor will maintain a TOP SECRET//RESTRICTED DATA//CRITICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS DATA clearance for access to weapon output data and other relevant information throughout the period of performance of the contract. The contractor must adhere to all ITAR requirements.</p>
<p>At this time the government is unsure what the future requirements, if any, will be.</p>
<p>The government believes this is a sole source effort IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). The personnel of AEM Services, Inc. has been providing software upgrades, training and manual updates to the government&nbsp;for over 24 years. &nbsp;If the government does not use AEM Services, Inc. to support AEM, it would cause substantial duplication of cost to the government to train another source to gain the same level of expertise as has already been achieved by AEM Services Inc.</p>
<p>Please email Statement of Capabilities (SOC), not to exceed 6 pages, to the contracting officer NLT 3 MAR 15. In the SOC please address how your company can overcome the government's sole source rationale and can satisfy the technical requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.</p>

<DESC>I.  INTRODUCTION: <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI), as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e). <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff Installation Management (OACSIM) Army Environmental Division (ISE), Installation Services Directorate is seeking information on an enterprise resource planning (ERP) commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) SAP-based environmental data to provide Helpdesk and Long-term Sustainment services to support HQAES services.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for contract holders currently registered as a small business under the NAICS code 541512, Computer System Design Services, with a size standard of $27.5 million.  Additionally, the scope includes Special Item Number (SIN) 132 51 Information Technology (IT) Professional Services, which includes system design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing, programming, conversion, implementation, and other relevant services of an ERP software package from a SAP Army data environment.   <br>  <br> II. PURPOSE: <br>  <br> The purpose of this RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Information received in response to this RFI shall be safeguarded adequately from unauthorized disclosure.  This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an eventual acquisition approach.  This RFI does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation.  Neither unsolicited proposal nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this request or accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Contractors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with participating in this RFI.  Acknowledgement of receipt of submitted items will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the information received.  Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to determine the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business community for providing the required services.   <br>  <br> The Army plans to implement best practices, to improve productivity, gain efficiencies, and realize cost savings in consideration of industry recommendations in the delivery of the HQAES. <br>  <br> III. BACKGROUND: <br>  <br> The Army Environmental Program (AEP) mission is to sustain the environment to enable the Army's mission and secure the future. The goal is to improve readiness by helping to provide and ensure continued access to quality training lands and facilities with minimal restrictions on operations. The Army chose an enterprise resource planning (ERP) commercial off the shelf (COTS) software package from SAP as the enterprise solution for Army environmental data management collection and reporting. This COTS software package has been customized to fit Army environmental business processes.  The current execution contract will tentatively expire in Sep 2015, however it is anticipated that there will be a three-six month extension to allow for transition. The services discussed herein are planned to be part of the overarching ERP services acquisition which will support HQAES.  Because HQAES has an imminent need for support services this RFI is being published while the Army continues to formulate the overarching strategy. <br>  <br> To continue business process transformation, IT solutions supporting the AEP must be modernized to align with new business processes. Key areas for transformation include: establishing a capability to comply with environmental liability reporting requirements, monitoring and reporting on the performance of the AEP, and conducting program analysis to optimize environmental cleanup and environmental quality activities. <br>  <br> III.

<DESC>RFI Title: The Commander's Virtual Staff (CVS) <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTES OR AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBMISSSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO THE INTERESTED PARTIES FOR REPONSES. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005, on behalf of the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Command, Power, and Integration Directorate (CP&I), is conducting market research to seek information regarding emerging technologies to enable the development of a Virtual Staff capability for Army Commanders and leaders.   <br>  <br> Background and Description: <br> The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Command, Power, and Integration Directorate (CP&I) is requesting information regarding emerging technologies to enable the development of a Virtual Staff capability for Army Commanders and leaders. Computational technology offers new kinds and degrees of machine power that greatly expand the potential to facilitate and augment human cognitive activities - activities such as mission monitoring, situation assessment, plan generation and adaption and decision making.  Capabilities range from advanced data visualization techniques, to intelligent agents that work cooperatively as part of human-intelligent agent teams, to groupware that supports multi-person collaborative work to wearable assistive interfaces for visual, auditory and touch interaction. The Commander's Virtual Staff (CVS) will apply computer automation to assist the commander understand, visualize, describe, and direct tasks for the staff, and apply cognitive/intelligent agents to assist the commander and staff in their execution and management of the operations process, which remains incompletely automated. The scale of implementation ranges from a battalion formation employing CVS to several battalion formations working together with cooperation across instances of CVS to a brigade formation with its associated battalions, where some may not employ CVS up through a division formation.  Ideal technologies would be those that address the problem yet are extensible and able to incorporate third party contributions. The central CVS topic has been identified as having several sub-topics that are of interest: <br>  <br> 1.	Commander/Leader specific tools. Computer capabilities that specifically support leaders perform  quote mark art of command quote mark  tasks. The concept is to provide hands on tools leaders can use regardless of location (e.g. command post, in vehicles, or dismounted) <br>  <br> 2.	Commander/staff workflow coordination and collaboration. Tooling to assist in the tasking, tracking, production and sharing of work products and task deliverables regardless of the relative location of the commander or the staff.  <br>  <br> 3.	Data consolidation. Technologies to provide storage, enriching and searching data for a single authoritative and consistent source for Mission Command information and situational awareness that is currently drawn from multiple MC systems and often mentally fused.  <br>  <br> 4.	Planning. An integrated domain-independent planning capability that enables domain-specific knowledge to be added. Ideally the planning capability would produce several models based on previous unit performance in similar situations as well as current unit and environmental state that could be used for wargamming, analysis and driving other computer and human systems. The capability should also provide effects models that predict the outcome of selected operations/tasks. <br>  <br> 5.	Automated assessments. Provide the commander with continually available computer-assisted running estimates and assessments based on current, future and alternative plans as well as the commander's intent. These should be available for all aspects of every type of mission including, for example, assessing the progress of preparation during the Operations process. <br>  <br> 6.	Predictions. The ability to recognize and reason about evolving situations based on situational data and the context of the current plan/goals. Predictions should be able to be improved based on lessons learned during after action reviews (AARs) and continual corrections.  <br>  <br> 7.	Recommendations. Automatically produced recommendations, with associated probabilities and confidence levels, and alternatives for consideration based on domain-specific knowledge, goals, and situational awareness. Recommendations should be able to be improved based on lessons learned during AARs.  <br> Keywords: Decision Support Capability, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Centered Design, Trust Research, Workflow and Task Analysis, Data Management, Ubiquitous Computing Techniques, Dynamic Network Analysis, natural language processing, supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning, rules engine, expert systems <br>  <br> The DoD, specifically the U.S. Army is in a unique area where emergent technologies integrated within a networked environment assist Commanders & Key Leaders, decision-making, building cohesive teams, development shared situational understand, which encapsulate the human endeavors culminated under the Mission Command Unified Land Operations concept (complexity of task and human interactions within teams that are socio-cognitive networks interacting with information networks that are built on communication networks).

<DESC>Document Type:       	Sources Sought Notice  <br> Contract Number: 	W91QUZ-07-D-0005  <br> Task Order Number: 	BG10 <br> Posted Date:         	20 February 2015 <br> Response Date:       	25 February 2015 <br> NAICS Code:      	541330 - Engineering Services <br> Place of Performance:  Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD and Fort Hood/Killeen, TX  <br>  <br> This Sources Sought Notice(SS) /Request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes, and is not to be considered an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  No reimbursement will be a made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this SS/RFI or any follow up information request.    <br>  <br> This is a market survey to identify potential sources capable of providing the Lower Tactical Internet (LTI) Data Products (DP) Production and Support Services in support of a six (6) month period of performance. Northrop Grumman Information Systems Sector (NG-ISS) is the incumbent contractor on contract W91QUZ-07-D-0005 Task Order BG10. NG-ISS currently develops, produces, and maintains the LTI production services in support of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems using a proprietary initialization software tool and processes.  The planned period of performance is for six (6) months from 13 March 2015 to approximately 25 September 2015.  This service is being extended in order to provide time to convert this requirnment from Contractor supported to Government supported.  The scope of this market survey is to identify a potential source capable of performing all areas of required support to be considered responsive. The contractor shall not restate the PWS but describe in detail the information requested. Restating the PWS without detail of how meeting the requirement will lead to an unacceptable response.  <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT <br>  <br> The Tactical Internet (TI) is composed of a series of C4ISR systems (clients like Advanced Field Artillery Technical Data Systems (AFATDS) or Command Post of the Future (CPOF)) and enablers (transport like Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T's) Satellite Transportable Terminal (STT) and Network System (NS's) Enhanced Position Location and Reporting System (EPLRS)).  Together this forms a network architecture.  The original vision for the TI provided capability at Corps through Brigade Levels.  These echelons had relatively fixed environments (command posts, installations, etc...) where it was feasible to provide communications via large satellites, shelter mounted equipment and semi-permanent structures (ex. Standardized Integrated Command Post Systems (SICPS)) providing high bandwidth networking equipment.  This original vision has come to be referred to as the Upper Tactical Internet (UTI).  Sometime after the development and acquisition of these systems, it became clear that the need to extend the network below the Brigade level (e.g., Battalion), and in an on-the-move capacity was required.  This capability needed higher levels of availability and mobility, and was, therefore, constrained to the lower bandwidth associated with network transmission by radio (satellite transmission via L-Band was introduced later).  This follow-on requirement became known as the Lower Tactical Internet (LTI).   <br>  <br> Project Director Initialization (PdD I) is chartered to initialize the TI.  Initialization Production is used to create database files to allow communication for both the UTI and the LTI networks.  Initialization Products are defined as a collection of key mission information which is loaded into Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) and other C4ISR systems, to allow each of them to communicate throughout the UTI and LTI networks.  Specifically, the Initialization Production includes the development, production, and maintenance of Government-owned data required to ensure effective digital communication amongst the aforementioned systems.  The Initialization Product is currently delivered by the Contractor, through electronic transfer of the data and/or by delivery of a Compact Disc (CD), to the Government.  The LTI Initialization Support Services refer to the enabling functions relative to production: Engineering, Configuration Management (CM), Quality Assurance (QA), Test, Program Management, and other Services, as required.  The entire scope of this effort requires work be performed which spans the life cycle of the Initialization Data.   <br>  <br>  <br> The contractor may submit their responses to this market survey as a potential source of the Government's chosen contracting strategy services, as described above. <br>  The Government does not have detailed documentation on hardware modules or the software source code for the NG ISS proprietary software tool or associated processes. Consequently, the Government does not have the detailed documentation or source code to provide to a third party.    <br>  <br> The assigned North American Industry Classfication (NAICS) code for this potential requirement is 541330, for Engineering Services with the correspondence small business size standard of $14M Both large and small businesses are encourage to response.   <br>  <br>  <br> Please provide the following additional information as part of any responses: <br>  <br> 1)  State as to whether or not your company is considered a small or large business. Please also indicate any socioeconomic classification (8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman-Owned, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, or HUB-Zone) that applies. <br>  <br> 2)  Please explain in detail the technical ability and capacity to provide LTI Data Products as required in the PWS para 7.0 thru 7.2.3.3? Please address the consolidated production process for a 10 week build and describe in detail the integrated process with UTI production process. Please demonstrate your understanding of the information needed and process to produce data products. This should include the flow of information through the production process and the interactions within the process.  <br>  <br> 3)  Please explain in detail your program management approach to LTI Data Product Production. <br>  <br> 4)  Please submit a proof of concept/production plan and describe in detail the LTI Data Product Production tool's effectiveness to perform at a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of 9, as defined in DoD 5000.2R.  <br>  <br> 5)  Do you have the ability to manage, as a prime contractor, the types and magnitudes of the taskings in the PWS?  Detailed explanation required. What contracts of similar complexity and scope have you managed in the past?  Please provide contract number and POC for this contract.  Must demonstrate past success in performing relevant and similar tasks. <br>  <br> 6)  Explain the ramp up approach to meet all requirements of the PWS by 13 March 2015.    <br>  <br> 7)  A consolidated process currently exists for the production of Data Products. Please demonstrate in detail how you will meet the requirement to produce and validate the LTI Data Product within the current consolidated process. The incumbent for the UTI is Computer Science Corporation (CSC) under contract W15P7T-10-D-D410 Task Order 0009.  <br>  <br> 8) What technical and programmatic risks do you foresee in executing LTI Data Products? What risk reduction measures would you employ to address these? <br>  <br> 9)  Describe your experience with Army Tactical Networks and specifically the relationship with UTI and LTI C4ISR systems. <br>  <br> 10)  Does your company currently have, or will have, a SECRET facility clearance before time of award? Please explain where, how certified, and with which agency and contract/contract number. <br>  <br> 11)  What is your experience in producing LTI data products? You must provide examples, including Contract Number, indicating whether your firm acted as a prime or subcontract, contract value, Government /Agency Point of Contact (POC), e-mail address, phone number, and a brief description of your direct support of the effort.  <br>  <br>  <br> PLEASE NOTE THAT IF A CHARACTERISTIC OR CAPABILITY IS NOT ADDRESSED THE GOVERNMENT WILL ASSUME THE RESPONDENT DOES NOT OR CANNOT MEET THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS MARKET SURVEY.  <br>  <br> The data received in response to this market survey is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements.  This notice is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information they provide.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, the information will be used in a Market Survey Report assessment of capable sources.  It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government.  However, we recognize that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. If so, clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum.  <br>  <br> Responses should be emailed to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Todd Strasavich,  Phone: 443.861.4954 Email: todd.m.strasavich.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> The suspense date for responses is 4:00pm EST 25 February 2015. <br>

<DESC>The FAA is seeking proposals from qualified contractors listed under Construction NAICS 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction for a major refurbishment and seismic upgrade at the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZAN ARTCC) Administrative Wing. This requirement is subject to full and open competition without regard to business size or type. Estimated Range for the project is between $5M and $10M.

SUMMARY OF WORK:  The work includes the abatement of hazardous materials in the ARTCC Administration Wings Basement and First Floors, demolition of and/or upgrades to existing partitions, ceilings, finishes, fixtures and appurtenances in those floors, and new partitions, ceilings, finishes, fixtures and appurtenances in new layouts.  The work also includes new plumbing and kitchen fixtures, new millwork, demolition and replacement of areas of the Basement concrete floor slab, and associated replacement of a segment of underground sewer piping in the area exposed.

New and/or extended mechanical, controls, plumbing, fire protection, and electrical distribution systems and components are included for the Administration Wings Basement and First Floors. The work also includes seismic upgrades to the Wings structural systems, including removal and replacement of selected areas of the Wings exterior masonry walls.

The Contract Documents assume there is no asbestos containing or other hazardous material within the exterior masonry walls to be removed and replaced in this Project.  The Work does include, however, core testing of these exterior walls to be removed, prior to abatement and demolition to verify the absence of such material.

Finally, miscellaneous demolition and new work are required for demolition of an existing exterior canopy near the loading dock, new penetrations through the Wings roof (which is under warranty), replacement of the existing entry vestibule, and relocation of miscellaneous exterior hardscape landscaping accessories.

All other areas of the facility not included in the Administration Wing Basement and First Floor project work area will remain occupied and functional throughout the project.
The work also includes providing Temporary Trailers at the project site to be used by the FAA as temporary office swing space for the FAA personnel being temporarily displaced for the implementation of the rehabilitation and seismic upgrades project.  The Scope includes securing the trailers from a trailer vendor/provider with internal fit-outs and finishes as shown on the contract documents and specifications, delivery of the trailers to the project site, installation of foundations, decks, steps, ramps and railings, installation of the trailers and connections to site utilities, and removal of the trailers at project completion and return of trailers to the trailer provider.  Scheduled maintenance and repair of the trailers during the duration of the lease is also included, with daily maintenance and janitorial services for the trailers to be provided by the FAA.
   
The Temporary Trailers are to be provided to the FAA by the General Contractor on a lease basis from the trailer provider to the Contractor for a period of 24 to 36 months.

This summary does not cover all aspects of the work.  See Screening Information Request DTFANM-15-R-00054 and all Specifications and Drawings for more detailed information.

Site Visits are planned for March 12 and March 26, 2015. See Part IV  Section L for details.

Offers are due on April 24, 2015.

<DESC>The Institute of Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) Measurement Division and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are collaborating on RF propagation measurements. As part of this project the engineers at ITS are developing an approach to characterize and quantify the attenuation due to vegetation and buildings. As part of this research, we need to accurately determine the location and structural heights of the vegetation and buildings along the propagation path. One of the more accurate methods to obtain this information is to use data obtained by Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) equipment.
<p><br />We are looking for software companies to process LiDAR data (las files) for research. Software requirements must include the following:</p>
<p>1. Output data in triangulated irregular network (TIN) format<br />2. Output data in digital elevation model (DEM) format<br />3. Process 100 million or more data points within a few minutes</p>
<p><br />In addition, software must process standard format LiDAR data (las files) to:<br />1. Verify data integrity of any las file, by checking overlap and alignment of flight lines, by checking elevations for a list of control points, and by removing duplicate points.<br />2. Find and distinguish buildings and vegetation.<br />3. Determine "bare earth" by identifying and removing buildings, vegetation, and other obstructions above ground.<br />4. Construct patch-based geometric (polyhedral) representations of ground, buildings, and vegetation.<br />5. Display information visually, in addition to providing quantitative outputs.<br />6. Allow user to view and output portions of the data, specified by geographic position.</p>
<p><br />All interested parties that feel they can provide this service should forward their capabilities in writing to MWilliams@ntia.doc.gov. Please indicate your business size as well. This notice will close on Wednesday, February 25, 2015 by 3pm. Please this is a Sources Sought posting, not a Solicitation. Quotes are not required.</p>

<DESC>PROJECT TITLE: Fiber Optic Switch
<p>LOCATION OF WORK: Supplies to be delivered to:<br />Radar Operations Center<br />1313 Halley Circle<br />Norman, OK 73069</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking sources capable of providing ABB Switzerland Pulse Power Switch Assemblies and associated Light Distribution Boxes or equal. NOAA is not seeking vendors to design, develop, and ten produce this requirement; we are seeking vendors already capable of providing a working solution.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this requirement is to replace the High Energy semiconductor switches used in the Line Modulator circuitry of the transmitter within the NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radar WSR-88D. The switch, when triggered to the "On" state, discharges the Pulse Forming Network within the modulator which has previously been charged to 5200 Volts maximum. The large current which results brings a Klystron into conduction. The existing switch is made with Reverse Biased Diode Thyristors (RBDT's) which are becoming obsolete.</p>
<p>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, in support of the NWS Radar Operations Center (ROC), seeks potential vendors to provide 245 High Speed Fiber Optic Switches with an accompanying Light Box.</p>
<p>This "Brand Name or Equal" procurement (FAR 6.302-1(c)) is of sufficient quantities of ABB Switzerland Pulse Power Switch Assemblies and associated Light Distribution Boxes to support the WSR-88D radar fleet.</p>
<p>Specific part numbers include:</p>
<p>ABB Switzerland LTD Part Number 5SVC 032708E130 Pulse Power Switch Assembly OR EQUAL</p>
<p>ABB Switzerland LTD Part Number 5SVB 020408T130 Light Distribution Box OR EQUAL</p>
<p>The salient characteristics of the existing RBDT switches are ten RBDT's stacked in series with suitable compression clamp hardware. Each switch has a minimum forward biased hold off voltage of 1100 volts giving the entire stack a hold off voltage of 11000 volts minimum. The normal forward biased stack voltage is 5200 volts maximum with an over voltage protection threshold of 5600 volts nominal. Provisions are made for proper operation with one RBDT shorted accompanied by the setting of a "Maintenance Required" alarm which alerts the operator of the problem. Due to the stringent availability requirements (96%) and unmanned nature of the NEXRAD transmitter, this feature is essential, especially in storm season. The Modulator is designed to operate with a maximum duty cycle of 0.004. The Modulator is capable of operation in two modes: Short pulse (1304 pulses per second maximum with a Pulse Width of 3 usec) and Long pulse (452 pulses per sec maximum with a pulse width of 6 usec). The switch must support this operation. The peak current per pulse is 896 amps maximum during the entire pulse width. Cooling air is supplied to the Modulator. Cooling requirements of the switch shall be stated in any responses to this request. The space available for the switch assembly is approximately 8 inches X 8 inches X 8 inches.</p>
<p>Specifically, NOAA requires the following units;</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 1EA High Speed Fiber Optic Switch with accompanying Light Distribution Box - First Article</p>
<p>CLIN 1001 4EA High Speed Fiber Optic Switch with accompanying Light Distribution Box - Limited Rate Initial Production</p>
<p>CLIN 1002 240EA High Speed Fiber Optic Switch with accompanying Light Box Optional Item - Full Production</p>
<p>DELIVERY SCHEDULE: First article units will be delivered to the ROC in Norman, OK 60 days after receipt of order. Developmental support units are due in 60 days of an approved First Article and full production is due within 6 months of LRIP.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a fixed-price supply contract for the cables.</p>
<p>This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.</p>
<p>No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Please submit information to include:</p>
<p>1) Your firm's DUNS number &amp; CAGE code;<br />2) Your firm's SBA certified small business concern status. Specifically identify if your firm is HUBZone-certified, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or SBA 8(a) program certified;<br />3) A brief description of your firm's ability to provide a fiber optic switch ABB Switzerland LTD Part Number 5SVC 032708E130 and 5SVB 020408T130 or equal.<br />4) Identify any major work components that your firm would likely subcontract out.</p>

<DESC>Background:<br />The NOAA Diving Center located in Seattle, Washington currently trains approximately 50 divers and divemasters per year at their Sand Point facility. The first week of training, which is largely underwater equipment familiarization, is conducted in a swimming pool. The NOAA Diving Center does not have an aquatic training facility and therefore must rent local pools. Given the constraints associated with many other pool users in a large city, the Diving Center has been limited in its training capacity and options. At present we have contracted for one week of local community pool usage in the spring and one week in the fall. These times are coincident with the week prior to the pool opening for the season and the week after the pool closes for the season. The NOAA Diving Center is therefore forced to design our training classes around pool availability. In order to increase our training capacity or expand our training options we require an aquatic training facility that is more readily available or purpose built for our use. <br />Facility Requirements:<br />1. Design &amp; Build Pool<br />Mandatory Design &amp; Build Requirements<br />&bull; Indoor/enclosed for year-round training options. <br />&bull; At least 75 feet in length and 50 feet width. <br />&bull; Must have shallow (3-4 ft) and deep (12-15 ft) areas. <br />&bull; Salt water used. <br />&bull; Must have adequate filtration system for clear (&gt; 25 ft) visibility. <br />&bull; Four ladders for diver egress (2 shallow and 2 deep). <br />&bull; Onsite parking for up to 15 vehicles with at least 10 ft by 10 ft area to load and unload dive gear.<br />&bull; Water environmentally controlled to approximately 84 degrees F.<br />&bull; Male and female locker rooms with capacity for 15 persons each and with restrooms on site. <br />&bull; Water fountain for diver hydration on site. <br />&bull; At least 10 ft of perimeter deck space for equipment staging and emergency response. <br />&bull; At least a 100-square-foot office space with table and 6 chairs for instructors. <br />&bull; At least 100 square feet of secure, lockable, overnight storage for dive and support gear. <br />&bull; Must allow aluminum scuba cylinders, lead weights, lift bags, rescue equipment, and small tools. <br />o Aluminum cylinders are 80 cu in standard size 20 lb (when full) air cylinders. <br />o Lead weights range in sizes from 1 to 10lbs and are carried in weight belts around the student's waist. <br />o Lift bags are small 1ft by 3ft heavy duty plastic bags that are filled with air by divers to practice lifting objects off the bottom. <br />o Rescue equipment is standard pool equipment like backboards, oxygen kits, AED.<br />&bull; Facility must accept government coverage for liability. <br />Design &amp; Build Desired Features:<br />&bull; Located within 10 miles (and 20 minutes) of the NOAA Sand Point facility.<br />&bull; Overhead crane capable of 1-ton loads reaching deep areas of the pool for launch and recovery of unmanned systems.<br />&bull; Protected clean power and internet connectivity for testing, programming, and controlling unmanned systems.<br />2.

The Contractor shall accept all Medicare rate changes for the period in which they are effective. 
 VA reserves the right to adjust the Per-Procedure rates under this contract at anytime should Medicare rates change regardless of whether the Contractor notified the VA Contracting Officer of the change(s).  The Contractor will be given a notice of such actions at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the effective date of the change(s).  Should there be any disagreement with the VA Contracting Officer's proposed change, the Contractor must submit a response outlining those areas in which the Contractor disagrees.  This response must be provided to the Contracting Officer within seven (7) calendar days of notification of the anticipated change.  The VA Contracting Officer reserves the right to make the final determination with regard to any change.  Should the VA Contracting Officer implement any change(s) in Medicare rates under this contract, the Contractor shall accept all corresponding adjustments for the time period in which they are effective.

Background:  Through the Health Care for Homeless Veterans Program (HCHV), the VA provides case management services to Veterans, and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services.  HCHV's goal is to engage homeless Veterans in treatment, and place them in a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals. 

The HCHV Program, an essential and critical part of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), is vital for providing a gateway to VA and community supportive services for eligible Veterans.  The HCHV Safe Haven Contract for homeless Veterans is a vital program focused on addressing the needs of homeless Veterans services through a "Low Demand Safe Haven" model of residential care provided by a qualified community based contractor.  Those homeless Veterans who are chronically homeless with serious mental illness and substance use diagnosis will be encouraged to work towards permanent housing within 6 months of admission, extensions will be approved based on the VA's discretion.

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;">NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA)</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">20 February 2015</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT MODIFICATION</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract modification under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized and involve the continuing development of a major system and award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>The Government conducted extensive market research leading up to development of its acquisition plan when this requirement was originally solicited in 2008. Although this market research indicated that there was interest in the requirement from more than one contractor, two proposals were received and the contract was awarded on a best value basis.  Due to the continuing development and transition to operations of the major system, the government has determined that the incumbent contractor is the only source that can provide the immediate services for the current critical mission.</p>
<p>This sole source contract modification will allow the incumbent, Harris Corporation, to provide continuing mission support of the Geostationary Orbital Environmental Satellite-Series R (GOES-R) Core Ground System. The existing contract will not expire until 31 May 2019, however, the project has experienced cost growth and overruns and in order to ensure future changes are considered, it has been determined that the contract ceiling needs to be increased by approximately $250M. The current contractor possesses the required experience and technical knowledge based on developing the GOES-R Core Ground System and providing services in support of integration, test, and pre-launch activities.  Increasing the ceiling under this contract will ensure that the incumbent continues to provide these services through launch and transition to operations which is essential to overall mission success. No other contractor currently has the required GOES-R specific experience necessary to ensure continuation of providing critical services to NOAA in accomplishment of the GOES-R mission.</p>
<p>The effort includes continuing developmental work and services associated with supporting full system integration of the Core Ground System with the satellite both pre and post-launch as well as transition to operations. This contract modification will result in increasing the ceiling of the existing cost-plus-award fee (CPAF) contract to a total of approximately $1.286B.  The sole purpose of this contract modification is to ensure these critical mission requirements continue.</p>
<p>While this notice of intent is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties (to include small and small disadvantaged businesses) may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information for consideration by the agency for future requirements only. Please keep the responses to 15 one-sided pages or less. The applicable NAICS code is 541512 for Computer System Design Services with a corresponding size standard of $27.5M. The Classification Code is "A" Research and Development. This announcement constitutes the only notice for this carry-over effort.</p>
<p>The incumbent is the only contractor who currently can provide GOES-R Core Ground System supports support given the unique and highly skilled nature of the effort. At this time, there are no other contractors who are capable of providing these services without incurring an unacceptable delay to on-going operations.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY for the purpose of exploring alternative solutions and determining industry standards for operations and maintenance services and custodial services in government facilities. In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), the information requested is for planning purposes only and is not intended to bind the Government. This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB) or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change. The General Services Administration has not made a commitment to procure any of the services discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice.

<p>Description:</p>
<p>GSA is seeking information from industry in the areas of Operation and Maintenance Services, and Custodial Services to reduce costs with minimal impact to the satisfaction of the tenants. We are seeking expert solutions that may result in changes to the attached scope of work that would achieve substantial costs savings. Some examples are reducing required reports, more streamlined maintenance programs, PM frequencies, or which requirements can be eliminated or reduced? To your knowledge how often has GSA provided feedback saying how we use reports, or how we benefited from them? How can current installed technology reduce staff levels? How big of a risk is the $2500 repair threshold? What risks currently born by the contractor, can be shifted back to GSA?<br /><br />GSA is open to any suggestions for modifying or eliminating requirements per the scope of work. If you would like to provide us with a commercial statement of work that you feel is comparable and would yield the same outcome, please provide a copy to us. We appreciate your time and effort in responding to this request for information.</p>
<p>Requested Information</p>
<p>The response to this RFI will be in writing submitted to the point of contact below. Any individual or institution may respond to this RFI, and there is no limit on the number of responses that an individual or institution may submit.</p>

<p>Submissions to this RFI are due by 4:00 pm CST, 9 March 2015</p>
<p>GSA recognizes the need to protect proprietary information and does not intend to broadly disseminate the RFI responses. RFI responses should be clearly marked proprietary information.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT: Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, it is the Government's intent to award a sole source service contract to the New Mexico State Police (NMSP) for the Law Enforcement Services for Conchas Dam Lake recreation area. The objectives of this contract are to provide public safety and law enforcement so that the public can enjoy recreation activities as well as maximizing law enforcement visibility at the project site in order to deter crime. <br>  <br>  THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION.   <br>  <br> This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No solicitation document is available, and telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation will not be honored.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  All responses received within 15 days will be considered.  If no affirmative written response is received, the service contract will be awarded without further notice.   <br>  <br> A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed service contract is based on the New Mexico State Police being the only agency able to adequately meet the requirements of the service contract. The New Mexico State Police can provide law enforcement by certified Peace Officers to support the Conchas Dam Lake recreation area within a reasonable timeframe ( less than 1 hour). The New Mexico State Police are stationed in Tucumcari and have state-wide jurisdiction. Law Enforcement must be carried out by state certified officers usually employed by Government entities; therefore, commercial companies cannot provide these services. <br>  <br> A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is based upon the fact the New Mexico State Police meets the requirement as dictated under FAR 6.302-1.    <br>  <br> Detailed capabilities of interested vendors must be submitted to the following email address no later than 2:00 PM (MST) 09 March 2015, diana.m.keeran@usace.army.mil. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<DESC>WHERE: Robert H. Mollohan Research Center (formerly the I-79 Technology Research Center), 1000 Galliher Drive, Fairmont WV 26554
<p>WHEN: 2 April 2015, 9:00 AM - 4:00 pm. Registration begins at 8:30.</p>
<p>HOSTED BY: The I-79 Development Council with assistance of Federal and other non-profit small business advocate agencies.</p>
<p>COST: FREE FREE FREE</p>
<p>Registration is through Constant Contact and may be accessed thru the following link: <br />http://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/event?oeidk=a07eagb0bhf34d47315&amp;llr=lywwspiab<br />Registration is limited to the first 300 attendees, so register early! Check out the FAQ's for more specific information; visit the website for event information. You can reach the homepage of the event via www.dynetworking.com to read what it's all about.</p>
<p>NOTICE! The Federal government is buying and Federal Prime contractors are looking for qualified subcontracting partners!</p>
<p>Small Businesses interested in the federal market are encouraged to attend this FREE regional tri-state event. Government agencies and prime contractors in a wide range of NAICS from the Tri-State area of Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio will be there to find qualified small businesses to help them meet federally mandated goals. While this is a tri-state event, all small AND LARGE contractors are invited to participate. Past attendees came from 10 states - truly a regional event.</p>
<p>Dynamic Networking for Small Business will give the Tri-State's small businesses the networking opportunities to match their capabilities with multiple federal agencies and prime contractors at one convenient location. Through the combined efforts of the I-79 Development Council and assistance agencies such as the US Army Corps of Engineers, the US Small Business Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal participants, this networking event makes a host of resources available to the small business person they otherwise would not have access to without expending a great deal of time and effort.</p>
<p>Large business prime contractors will be on hand to help mentor and partner with their small business brethren and this networking event is what it is all about. This is not structured matchmaking; it is a high-energy networking day without agendas, guest speakers, and a lot of other fluff. Creating a venue where networking is the main event brings everyone to the table - it is amazing what can get done over a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>PLUS, organizations that support small businesses in the federal market will also be on hand to share their expertise.</p>
<p>Workshops are also scheduled by multiple agencies and there will be a cyber station to help new businesses register to do business with the government. If you plan on registering for the first time, you will need a Dun and Bradstreet number prior to arrival, so click here if you need to obtain one: http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform Allow one week for the receipt of your Duns number. Also needed to complete the ACH payment portion of your firm's registration is your business banking information to include routing number and account number. Registration is via secure website in the System for Award Management (SAM) system - a must for contractors who want government contracts awarded to them.</p>
<p>Other training opportunities include topics such as The Do's and Don'ts of Proposal Preparation, Financial Contract Management, Building Effective Capability Statements, Subs &amp; Partners: What Primes Look For; to name a few.</p>
<p>Concurrent to the event, at 3:00 pm the Small Business Administration's Ombudsman will conduct a roundtable discussion for small business and all are welcome to attend. The roundtable is not part of DYNET, so questions concerning that portion may be answered by contacting Ms. Marilyn Landis at mlandis@businessbasics.biz</p>
<p>If you are interested in expanding your business opportunities, this event is for YOU.</p>

<DESC>Notice of the Government's Intent to Award a Sole-Source Task Order under Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading-Edge Solutions II&nbsp;(EAGLE II) Strategic Sourcing Contract.<br /><br />The Coast Guard Command, Control, Communications, and Information Technology Service Center (C4IT SC) Procurement and Contracting Organization, in support of the Coast Guard Operations Systems Center (OSC), intends to award a sole source, fixed-priced task order with Ace Info Solutions, Inc. for Core Technologies Support (CTS) services in support of OSC, Kearneysville and the CG Finance Center in Chesapeake, VA. The CTS services incorporate all IT support services required to provide hardware, network, and critical infrastructure services and components which support USCG and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) IT systems and communications networks developed, hosted and/or maintained by the OSC. The task order will be awarded under DHS EAGLE II IDIQ contract # HSHQDC-13-D-E2083, Functional Category 1, 8(a) Business Track. The task order is necessary to "bridge" the period between the final CTS task order option period expiring on May 31, 2015 and the anticipated time necessary to award the follow-on CTS II vehicle. The proposed period of performance for the "bridge" task order is a base period of 7 months (June 1, 2015 - December 31, 2015), with one (1) three (3) month option period (January 1, 2016 - March 31, 2016) and a final two (2) month option period (April 1, 2016- May 31, 2016) for a potential twelve (12) month period of performance.
<p>The C4IT SC conducted a recent assessment of OSC operations. As a result of the assessment, new business processes will be implemented so as to achieve cost savings across OSC's infrastructure, application development, and application maintenance services. OSC will immediately undertake a radical transformation of contracting structures, operating model, and internal capabilities. C4IT Senior Leadership fully endorsed the strategies identified to move forward in a two year comprehensive transformation roadmap to establish and implement a new operating model. The new operating model will be incorporated into the design and structure of the CTS follow-on acquisition (CTS II). The time necessary for implementation of a services based operating model necessitates the issuance of a "bridge" task order to "bridge" the period between the final CTS option period expiring on May 31, 2015 and the anticipated time necessary to award the follow-on CTS vehicle (December 2015).</p>
<p>The purpose of the task order, if executed, will be to ensure the continuity of mission critical Core Technology Support Services for the U.S. Coast Guard currently being performed. These are highly specialized technologies. The performance of these services require special skills, training, and on the job experience requiring several months to gain proficiency and competency. Competing this requirement and awarding to other than the incumbent contractor, Ace Info Solutions, Inc., could result in substantial delays and potential disruption of mission critical services. There is high risk that critical security vulnerabilities and potential disruption of mission critical systems and business applications could directly and immediately impact the entire CG workforce.</p>
<p>The C4IT SC Procurement and Contracting Organization intends to negotiate this task order on a sole source basis with Ace Info Solutions, Inc., in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10 U.S.C. 2304&copy;(1).</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A COMPETITIVE QUOTE. This notice is to advise Industry of the Government's plan of action and the necessity of issuing a "bridge" task order.</p>
<p>Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Government's requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government. If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, awarding of the "bridge" task order will be initiated without further notice.</p>
<p>Questions and comments pertaining to this procurement shall be emailed to Craig.E.Anderson@uscg.mil.</p>

This notice is not a request for competitive quotes, proposals, or information.  Please direct any questions to Krista Shreet at krista.shreet@va.gov. 



DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS VISN 5
Justification and Approval For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Activity:

Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 5, 849 International Dr., Linthicum MD

Requisition No. Funded/Paid thru VA Form 138, Obligation or Change in Obligation, in accordance with Volume  II -Chapter 6

2.	Nature and/or Description  of the Action Being Processed:

Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), the VA has a requirement which can only be reasonably met by a single supplier. This action is to establish a new Basic Ordering Agreement with current contractor St. Ann at this time may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow on contract, when it is likely that an award to another source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The VA Maryland Healthcare System anticipates entering into a sole source acquisition negotiation for eligible Veterans to "continue" receiving Adult Day Health services located in Md.

St. Ann is currently supporting the VAMC by providing service which would otherwise require nursing home placement. ADHC services will be furnished to Veterans in the community for whom such care is specifically authorized by the VAMC Martinsburg.  

The Government anticipates awarding a Basic Ordering Agreements, in accordance with FAR 16.703. A binding contract is will be formed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this BOA, when the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agrees non-VA is required and the contractor agrees to accept the patient and provide direct patient care services. Upon acceptance by the Contractor of beneficiaries of VA, all clauses and terms and conditions of this BOA shall apply and become a part of the resultant contract during such time as VA patient remains in the contractor care at the expense of VA.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:

A Sole source award will be made to St. Ann for continuous services to veterans and eligible beneficiaries. St. Ann hereafter referred to as "ADHC" will provide care to include: activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, adult day health care services.  Striving to meet and maintain the healthcare needs and promote maximum wellbeing, a break in continuity of care to our Veterans would prove detrimental and "negatively" impact the quality of life for this aged Veteran population who require critical assisted services and supportive environment.

This Basic Ordering Agreement cost estimate is as follow: (5)-Five Year Cost Estimate:  $271,000
 

o	Contracting Officer's (CO) Cost Estimate: Placements will be made in contract facilities based in availability of facilities and the desires of the veterans and their respective families. Because it is impossible to determine actual usage of any particular contract facility; the VA uses Basic Ordering Agreements with no guaranteed minimums. However, based on a usage rate of one veteran for 365 days, a reasonable estimate for the value of any particular contract would be around $50,000 per year, with many facilities experiencing authorized Veteran populations in excess of 15 per year. Daily rate differ depending on negotiated terms based on the Medicare Rate. Five-(5) Year estimate: $271,000.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:

FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(d) (1) (A): Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.	Demonstration  that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the
Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):

As noted in paragraph 3, ADHC services are essential to the provision of planned programming designed to promote social and health related services to aging Veterans in the service area who are no longer able to manage independently or who are isolated without an essential support network to facilitate needed care services. A break in the continuity of care to our Veterans would prove detrimental and negatively impact the wellbeing of the aged Veteran population who require assisted services and supportive environment. Recompleting the services would result in a change in services to the existing Veterans who already are enrolled and receiving service based on medical necessity for years.

Veterans with long term psychiatric conditions or organic brain dysfunctions would likely experience  a decline in functioning or experience an exacerbation in their level of functioning mentally, emotionally, and physically resulting from a disruption or change in vendor. A decrease in stability could potentially lead to irreversible harm or even death. (Note: stability with respect to such medical treatment as may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of an individual from a vendor). Consistency in their therapeutic milieu is warranted. The primary goal is to maintain or restore the Veteran to the highest attainable level of health and well-being, thus Veteran treatment should be focused on stabilizing symptoms as much as possible. The benefit of a supportive environment would serve both veterans and their caregivers.

Discontinuation of the current contract services will cause an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirement  for Veteran  support and  cause substantial  duplication  of cost to the Government  that  is not 
expected to be recovered through competition .

The current facility have and will continue to meet all state licensing requirements including the state requirement pertaining to level of medical liability insurance.

6.	Description  of  Efforts  Made  to  ensure  that  offers  are  solicited  from  as  many  potential   sources as deemed practicable:

A notice of Intent to sole source will be published on FedBizOpps.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:

In order to determine whether the contractor's proposed price is fair and reasonable, the Contract Specialist will review the proposed rates against VHA Benchmark rates. If the contractor's proposed price appears to be questionable for reasonableness, a justification from the contractor will be required in order to determine whether the proposed price is fair and reasonable before award.

8.	Description of the Market Research  Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:

Research was conducted on a limited basis due to the limitation of the geographic area. Research was conducted to establish ADHC contract services located throughout the local VA 's catchment area to provide homemaker services to Veterans near or as near as possible to family or friends. Market research for future agreements is dependent on the needs of the patient's population in the catchment area and resources availability of the VA Medical Center. The objective is to maximize patient care while maintaining compliance with VA regulations.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: Continuing service is critical to Veterans to sustain a quality of life at an acceptable level.
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: Not Applicable for this requirement.
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition  before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:

The Contracting Office has identified way to improve and increase competition for the medical services in areas where completion can be considered . Approval not to compete does require VA Director and Chief of Staff approval prior to acquiring the medical services. The procurement action will be posted to the Government Point of Entry. Any responses will be referred the GEC coordinator for future consideration and marker research of source availability.

<p><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical -Response to the 2 technical factors listed in the solicitation.<br />2. Past Performance <br />3. Price</p>
<p>Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non cost factors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evaluation process will be conducted as follows:</p>
<p>(a)(1) Price will be evaluated by comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. If adequate price competition is determined to not exist then the government will use one of the other techniques established in FAR 15.404-1 to ensure the Government receives a fair, reasonable and balanced price. The government will evaluate a minimum of 3 lowest priced offerors for technical acceptability, past performance acceptability and price reasonableness. Should all of the 3 lowest priced offerors fail to receive an acceptable technical and past performance rating, the process will continue in order of price until an offeror with acceptable technical and past performance rating and fair and reasonable price is identified. The total evaluated price will be the sum of the extended unit prices for all CLINS and option years. The Government may determine an offer unacceptable if the proposed prices are materially unbalanced. Materially unbalanced is defined as significantly understated or overstated in relation to the actual cost of the service, or when the price is determined not to be fair and reasonable. The offeror shall submit completed pricing data for services and CLINS.<br />(a)(1)(i) The Government will use various price analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair and reasonable price. It is expected that the competitive nature of this acquisition will drive price reasonableness and fairness; however, the Government reserves the right, if it deems appropriate, to make these determinations by means of one or more price techniques established in 15.404-1. <br />(a)(1)(ii) The Government will evaluate the 6 month extension of services clause at FAR 52.217-8 by adding half of the price for the last option year to the total evaluated amount.</p>
<p>(a)(2) Technical acceptability will be rated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. The definitions of acceptable and unacceptable are written below. Failure to be acceptable on any one (1) or more of the two (2) technical criteria listed below will make the offeror technically unacceptable. The offeror must be technically acceptable in ALL technical areas in order to be found technically acceptable overall.</p>
<p>Technical:</p>
<p>1.SBA 8(a) Business Development Program participant: Offeror shall supply a letter from the Small Business Administration that verifies the current active status within the SBA 8(a) BDP. The standard is met when the offeror provides a letter that shows active status within the SBA 8(a) BDP through at least&nbsp;01 April&nbsp;2015 or contract performance start date, whichever is the latter. The standard is met when the offeror provides a letter that shows active status within the SBA 8(a) BDP through at least 01&nbsp;June 2015 or contract performance start date, whichever is the latter.</p>
<p>2. Quality Control: The offeror shall submit a quality control plan that addresses Performance Work Statement at both the Service Summary area identified in Section 2 and the Air Force Standards identified by Appendix A. At a minimum, the plan shall specifically address the contractor's strategy to provide quality workmanship, continual process improvement and for correcting deficiencies as required. The standard is met when the QCP addresses the contractor's strategy for meeting the requirements of the Performance Work Statement Service Summary and Appendix A. The standard is met when the QCP addresses the contractor's strategy for meeting the requirements of the Performance Work Statement Service Summary and Appendix A.</p>
<p>(a)(3) Evaluating Past Performance: The evaluation team will assess past performance, specifically information on relevant and recent contracts obtained from the references provided, and the use of past performance questionnaires and/or surveys and additional means (such as the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System CPARS). Relevant past performance is defined as a contract(s) that required the offeror to perform custodial services at multiple buildings (at a minimum of 80 separate buildings or 200K total square footage regardless of number of buildings) similar to that of the effort required by the Performance Work Statement contained in this solicitation. Recent past performance is defined as any Past/present performance transaction related in magnitude to this solicitation within three (3) years of the closing date on this solicitation. but limited to the most recent 10 contracts. Past performance information regarding other divisions, predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, subcontractors, or teaming contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be taken into account when such information is relevant to this acquisition.</p>
<p>The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to make an evaluation of the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. Past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be taken into account when such information is relevant to this acquisition. Past performance information may include data on efforts performed by other divisions, critical subcontractors, or teaming contractors, if such resources will be brought to bear or significantly influence the performance of the proposed effort.</p>
<p>A past performance questionnaire (Attachment 1) is provided with the solicitation so that offerors may send them to the recent and relevant references of their choice. Past performance references who have returned the questionnaires may be used in the past performance assessment. The evaluation team may follow-up on any non-responses to surveys. Upon receipt of the past performance surveys, the evaluation team will screen the information provided for each of the referenced contracts to make an initial determination of its recency and relevance to the current requirement.</p>
<p>TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS: Teaming arrangements are defined as two or more business entities that are working together under the representation of one of the existing business entities for the duration of the contract. A teaming arrangement is not a formal merger of two or more business entities and offerors must identify in their offer any teaming arrangement to be considered and completely identify the relationships/responsibilities of the teaming members. All past performance information submitted by the teaming partners will be considered during the evaluation process, but since only one business may represent the teaming entities, an overall past performance rating for the only primary representing business will be assigned during the evaluation process.</p>
<p>JOINT VENTURES: Joint ventures are defined as two or more business entities that have been merged to create one business entity with equal responsibility during the course of the contract. In a joint venture, past performance for both businesses will be evaluated equally.</p>
<p>Disclosing Past Performance Information to Offerors: The Contracting Officer will provide offerors with the opportunity to comment on negative past performance information on which they have not had a previous opportunity to comment. The validation process is particularly important when the negative information is provided by only one reference, or when there is any doubt concerning the accuracy of the information. Note that while the Government must disclose past performance problems to offerors, it shall not disclose the names of the individuals who provided information about an offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be rated on a Relevant/Not Relevant as well as a Recent/Not Recent basis.</p>
<p>RECENCY is defined as -Any Past/present performance transaction related in magnitude to this solicitation within three (3) years of the closing date on this solicitation.</p>
<p>RELEVANT is defined as - a contract(s) that required the offeror to perform custodial services at multiple buildings (at a minimum of 80 separate buildings or 200K total square footage regardless of number of buildings) similar to that of the effort required by the Performance Work Statement contained in this solicitation. The standard is met when the proposed past performance is for custodial services work at multiple buildings (at a minimum of 80 separate buildings or 200K total square footage regardless of number of buildings) similar to that of the effort required by the Performance Work Statement contained in this solicitation.</p>
<p>NOT RELEVANT is defined as contracts that didn't require the offeror to perform custodial services at multiple buildings (at a minimum of 80 separate buildings or 200K total square footage regardless of number of buildings) similar to that of the effort required by the Performance Work Statement contained in this solicitation. The standard is met when the proposed past performance is for custodial services work at multiple buildings (at a minimum of 80 separate buildings or 200K total square footage regardless of number of buildings) similar to that of the effort required by the Performance Work Statement contained in this solicitation.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable as well as a Recent/Not Recent basis.</p>
<p>Acceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. To be rated Acceptable, the offeror must have recovered from any non recurring problems with no impact to the contract performance and there must be no major problems identified. The standard is met when the past performance record does not show problems that have impacted the contract performance and/or major problems with contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. To be rated Unacceptable the standard for Acceptable will not have been met.</p>
<p>Note: An offeror will also receive an "acceptable" rating if their past performance record is unknown.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government will evaluate the 6 month extension of services clause at FAR 52.217-8 by adding half of the price for the last option year to the total evaluated amount. <br />The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(d) Award Without Discussions. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)</p>
<p>The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)</p>
<p>(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days ; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.</p>
<p>(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.</p>
<p>(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 60 months..<br />(End of clause)</p>

It will be used to masticate smaller diameter trees 8 inches and under, mow sagebrush, as well as putting in control lines for prescribed fire. This piece of equipment will help meet the overall forest fuels acres target in a safer more efficient way. We already have many bobcat attachments so it will need to be compatible. This piece of equipment will also need to have the rubber tracks instead of metal so it is light on the land.<br />

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p><br />The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Contracts Department, Patuxent River, MD in support of NAVAIR 4.4, Propulsion and Power, intends to negotiate an order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-14-G-0001 on a sole source basis with Hamilton Sundstrand, One Hamilton Road, Windsor Locks, CT 06096, in support of the Engineering Investigations (EIs) on NP2000 Propeller System Components. The scope of work to be performed by the OEM for engineering investigations includes but is not limited to "as received" functional checks to verify the reported discrepancy; disassembly of units to locate failures within each unit; documentation of original or previous build dimension records to those taken during disassembly. Detailed physical and metallurgical examination to verify suspect components meet design requirements. The Government intends to procure under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Hamilton is uniquely qualified to provide the complete range of program support required by the USN, USMC, and FMS fleets. Hamilton is also the only known firm to possess the technical data, drawings, and specifications necessary to fulfill the Government requirements. Given that Hamilton is the original designer and prime manufacturer and their continued involvement in the past and recent propeller system improvements, Hamilton has all the design intent information, original drawings, and most recent design changes, which are required to avoid undesirable interactions between existing and redesigned hardware. Hamilton also has immediate access to tooling, special equipment and test facilities as well as sub-vendors similar tooling and facilities. These are required to verify, design, and test new proposed engineering solutions. Privately developed data, materials, and design processes are the sole property of Hamilton. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS; however, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they can identify interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Responses must be received by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on 5 March 2015. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is: 336413-Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing. The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis based upon the responses received. The Government will not pay for any information received.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD:</strong> The government intends to award a fixed-price contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach.&nbsp; Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter&rsquo;s quotation against the below described evaluation criteria.&nbsp; In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price.&nbsp; The Government is more concerned about obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price.&nbsp; However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical and management quotation over another.&nbsp; Thus, to the extent that quoter&rsquo;s technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>

<p>SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET "HSCG38-15-Q-200077 - REQUIREMENTS" FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.</p>
<p>Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

<p>(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The USAID Mission in South Sudan (USAID/South Sudan) and OTI are seeking a highly motivated, highly qualified individual who would like the opportunity to help support a rapid international transition program in South Sudan. The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be the development, oversight and management of political transition programming that is jointly managed by OTI, the USAID Africa Bureau, and USAID/South Sudan. USAID supports U.S. Government objectives to reduce conflict in South Sudan. All efforts are coordinated with, and complementary to, the full range of USAID and Department of State assistance efforts. The Viable Support to Transition and Stability (VISTAS) program is USAID's primary vehicle for delivering a fast and flexible response to emerging priorities in South Sudan. Primarily through in-kind small grants and technical assistance, VISTAS activities are designed to create or preserve political space and help set the stage for more profound longer-term change.<br /> <br />The OTI Country Representative is a member of the Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team and reports to the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee. As a member of the USAID/South Sudan country team and specifically the USAID/South Sudan Office of Transition and Conflict Mitigation (OTCM), the Country Representative will be required to work closely and coordinate with the USAID/South Sudan Mission Director and other technical teams such as the Program Office and USAID/South Sudan Office of Democracy and Governance. The incumbent will be called upon to represent the office, mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials. As an integral member of the USAID/South Sudan Mission, the OTI Country Representative will serve as the OTCM Team Leader.<br /> <br />The Country Representative post is a senior-level position requiring supervisory management experience, the ability to serve as an effective liaison with a wide array of individuals and institutions, and an in-depth knowledge of international relations in general and of the sub-region in particular. Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights. Excellent interpersonal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary. Experience in contract and grant management is required.</p>
<p>Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies and/or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically-charged and challenging security environments. It is also essential that the incumbent demonstrate the ability to maintain staff morale in a difficult work environment. Strong team-building skills are essential.<br /> <br />9.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Resources inventory legislative authorities, NRCS policy, and responsibilities for conducting the NRI are contained in NRCS General Manual 290, Part 400. NRCS has also entered into a reimbursable agreement with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for a Rangeland Study on their lands in the western states.</p>
<p>Objective/Scope:<br />The objective of this solicitation is to acquire specified inventory data on up to two data points within each of about 75 segments (a potential total of 150 data points) located in some or all of four (4) counties on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land within the state of California. The subject counties are Inyo, San Bernadino, Riverside, and Imperial.</p>

<p>Please ensure that Attachment&nbsp;2 and 3 are returned with the submittal of the quote and that attachment&nbsp;1 is returned to the California State Office to the attention of John McClure by the person completing the past performance questionnaire.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  <br>    <br>  All quotes submitted will be evaluated for Technical Acceptability, Satisfactory Past Performance & Price.  The government will issue award to the offeror whose proposal is the Lowest Price of those determined to meet at least the minimum requirements to be determined Technically Acceptable & Demonstrates Satisfactory Past Performance.    <br>    <br>  (1) Technical Acceptability; is defined as the documented capability to meet the minimum requirements of the project specifications as defined in this solicitation and the attached scope-of-work.  <br>     <br>  (A) Offerors shall submit with their proposal package a project completion timeline/schedule including proposed progress milestones for the specified scope-of-work.   <br>    <br>   (2) Satisfactory Past Performance; to demonstrate satisfactory past performance the offeror shall submit documentation of satisfactory performance on past or current contracts involving contracts of a similar type, size, scope, and complexity, as well as, provide references, including names and contact information of references who can verify such past performance.  Past performance information of key personnel and crew may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be evaluated as neutral on Past Performance, providing the offeror supplies a certified statement with their offer that no past performance information is available.    <br>    <br>  The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance as well as data obtained from other sources available  i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating satisfactory past performance rests with the offeror.     <br>    <br>  It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient documentation and information for the Government to determine technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance, and proposed price.  Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine technical acceptability, past performance, or price may be cause for rejection of your quote.    <br>    <br>    <br>  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  <br>    <br>  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  <br>    <br>  (End of Provision)  <br>    <br>    <br>  52.212-4 	CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2014)  <br>    <br>  (a) Inspection/Acceptance.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.   <br>    <br>  (2)   <br>    <br>  (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name,  quote mark doing business as quote mark  name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:  <br>    <br>  (A) Change the name in the SAM database;   <br>    <br>  (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;  <br>    <br>  (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an  quote mark I agree quote mark  click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g.,  quote mark click-wrap quote mark  or  quote mark browse-wrap quote mark  agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.  <br>    <br>  (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.  <br>    <br>  (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.  <br>    <br>  (v) Incorporation by reference.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The SSDS-IM is a one-piece mounting solution that does not require the use of tools for rail attachment for the following weapon platforms: M110 and M107. The SSDS-IM is a commercial item under FAR 2.101 because several offerors offer similar improved mount systems for sale to the general public that can potentially meet the performance specifications for this effort. Per FAR 2.101, a commercial item is any item, other than real property, that is of a type customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes, and has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; or has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public. By conducting market research, the Marine Corps learned that the general public uses a one-piece mounting solution on commercially purchased rifles that have the same rail mechanism for mounting as the Marine Corps M110 &amp; M107 rifles. To offer the one-piece mounting solution to the general public, several vendors who manufacture the one-piece mounting solution list the item for sale via internet websites for mail delivery and offer items in retail sportsman stores.</span></p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The USAID Mission in South Sudan (USAID/South Sudan) and OTI are seeking a highly motivated, highly qualified individual who would like the opportunity to help support a rapid international transition program in South Sudan. The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be the development, oversight and management of political transition programming that is jointly managed by OTI, the USAID Africa Bureau, and USAID/South Sudan. USAID supports U.S. Government objectives to reduce conflict in South Sudan. All efforts are coordinated with, and complementary to, the full range of USAID and Department of State assistance efforts. The Viable Support to Transition and Stability (VISTAS) program is USAID's primary vehicle for delivering a fast and flexible response to emerging priorities in South Sudan. Primarily through in-kind small grants and technical assistance, VISTAS activities are designed to create or preserve political space and help set the stage for more profound longer-term change.<br /> <br />The OTI Country Representative is a member of the Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team and reports to the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee. As a member of the USAID/South Sudan country team and specifically the USAID/South Sudan Office of Transition and Conflict Mitigation (OTCM), the Country Representative will be required to work closely and coordinate with the USAID/South Sudan Mission Director and other technical teams such as the Program Office and USAID/South Sudan Office of Democracy and Governance. The incumbent will be called upon to represent the office, mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials. As an integral member of the USAID/South Sudan Mission, the OTI Country Representative will serve as the OTCM Team Leader.<br /> <br />The Country Representative post is a senior-level position requiring supervisory management experience, the ability to serve as an effective liaison with a wide array of individuals and institutions, and an in-depth knowledge of international relations in general and of the sub-region in particular. Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights. Excellent interpersonal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary. Experience in contract and grant management is required.</p>
<p>Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies and/or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically-charged and challenging security environments. It is also essential that the incumbent demonstrate the ability to maintain staff morale in a difficult work environment. Strong team-building skills are essential.<br /> <br />9.

<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on the implementing partner's performance, budget, and appropriateness of scope in achieving OTI's country objectives, presenting modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract in accordance with USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>

<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g. Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests;</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">****************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE. </span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide acquisition services for non-standard and difficult to purchase standard items in support of foreign military sales. This tri-service contract will support FMS Air Force, Navy and Army requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Effort Description: The Parts Repair Ordering System (PROS) Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor's performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing, quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer. The PROS program goal is to provide "one stop shopping" for the FMS country. The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), period of performance June 2012 - June 2017 (3-year base period with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), firm fixed price and cost reimbursable (task orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and an Objective Performance Incentive (OPI) . NOTE: The contemplated period of performance for this acquisition is 5-7 years, with a 3-6 month ramp up period to create and implement a procurement software system capable of interfacing with AFSAC's Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS), along with a logistics transition phase between the current and subsequent contractor. Government requests industry feedback on contemplated Period of Performance (PoP) and suggested ramp up period required in order for USG to solicit realistic time frames.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical Environment: Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The 90+ plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure rates. The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate computations make predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) supported on this contract are waived by the USAF for supply action usually due to inability to meet an established need date. However, the managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved sources. Approximately 22,000 supply requisitions and 4,500 maintenance requisitions are issued per year. Approximately 80% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being maintenance and task orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service. The majority of the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service. The successful bidder for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the contract. The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and OPI. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have been completed several years before. The successful bidder shall be advised to make arrangements to address this potential liability. <br />NOTE: The SDR process has been problematic in previous contracts. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract value amount is pass-through costs for procuring required parts and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desirable Features: Competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance; current contract contains a 90% effective competition rate. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings - best available price - minimizing participation fees, turn-around time - shortest possible lead-time - lead-time from after receipt of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Small business and other than small business participation is encouraged. Each company responding should indicate their business size in relation to the stated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code size standard. The NAICS assigned to this acquisition is 541614, "Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting", with a size standard of $15M. Your response must also indicate all socio-economic small business categories for which you qualify; small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. If you are a Small Business and you intend to subcontract a portion of this effort, please explain in your response how you intend to meet the 50% performance requirement. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit capability packages that outline their capability to provide the required purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. Additionally, interested firms should specifically state how they intend to meet the 3-6 month ramp up after contract award and discuss their capability to be fully operational within that time frame. Also, include any comments/suggestions on structuring SDR liability and resolution. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience and/or capabilities in all areas should be provided. Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar work within the past three (3) years. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 10 pages. Submit capabilities packages via e-mail to Tammy Tobe; tamara.tobe@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Parts Ordering Repair Service-PROS." If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions related to this sources sought synopsis must be submitted via e-mail to the person indicated above NLT COB (Monday, 28 July 2014.) No further questions will be entertained after that date.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN COB Monday, 18 August 2014.<br />The PROS Program Management Office (PMO) will be hosting an Industry Days event for all interested parties. Information about Industry Days will be posted as a separate notice.</span></p>

<a href="mailto:travis.james3@us.army.mil">Travis James</a>
<DESC><br/><br/>****NOTICE:  THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN REVISED AS FOLLOWS****<br/><br/>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Picatinny, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for manufacturing M153, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) systems and spare parts, recapitalization/reset/overhaul of previously delivered M153 CROWS systems, and CROWS engineering and logistics support.  The total contract value is estimated at $970M. <br/><br/>The CROWS is a multivehicle externally mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing a variety of crew served weapons.  The CROWS provides remote day and night sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move. The major CROWS sub-assemblies include: Fire Control Unit, Control Grip, Main Frame Assy, Right Side Support Assy, Left Side Support Assy, Servo Sight Assy, Thermal Imaging Module, Visual Imaging Module, Soft Mount, Cocking Actuator, Laser Range Finder, Ammo Box Assy, Weapon Adaption Kits, Cables, and Cover.  This list is not all inclusive.  <br/><br/>The U.S. Government intends to satisfy the above CROWS requirements through a Firm Fixed Price, Full and Open Competition, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), single award contract.  The expected contract duration is five (5) years. Orders will be issued against the IDIQ contract in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).  The SOW will include:<br/><br/>I. Production of CROWS (total quantity estimated at 3,000 systems) and spare parts.  The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 50 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 150 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Product improvements, integrations, and testing.   <br/><br/>III.    Training, overhaul, depot-level, field maintenance support, recapitalization/reset of CROWS, and general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification includes the performance requirements and technical drawings.  The detail specification states the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and how the components are to be fabricated or constructed.  The detail specification does not include technical drawings and assembly procedures for some sub-assemblies, which are to be made by qualified directed sources at least until the First Article Testing phase.  This approach will ensure a very high level of commonality between the new CROWS producer and commonality/interchangeability with existing CROWS systems.  The U.S. Government will provide the aforementioned data on a Digital Video Disc (DVD).  Most data will be in a Portable Data Format (pdf) format but some data may be provided in other formats. <br/><br/>Below is a list of items that are planned to be provided as part of the formal solicitation: <br/> <br/> - Detail Specification<br/> - Performance requirements<br/> - Technical Drawings<br/> - Specifications and Interface Control Documents for those components for which detailed technical drawings are not provided.<br/> - Solid models for castings including machining drawings<br/> - Gerber formatted printed circuit board layouts with pick and place data<br/> - Assembly procedures<br/> - List of approved sources for sub-assemblies at various levels of production build <br/> - Quality requirements <br/> - Test requirements<br/> - Executable software files<br/><br/>The software code and associated documentation will not be released nor will prospective contractors have access to it at any time. Only the executable software files will be provided. The software code will be managed by the U.S. Government. Any software changes required in the execution of the contract will be addressed through a software change process between the U.S. Government and the prospective Contractor. <br/><br/>The design/production data described above will be provided upon request after the Request for Proposals release provided that all prerequisite paper work (described below) is properly completed, submitted, and approved.  <br/><br/>For U.S. & Canadian Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (U.S. & Canada) must complete and submit the following forms:<br/><br/> - DD2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement<br/> - AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire<br/> - Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement<br/> - Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement<br/><br/>The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced. <br/><br/>For Other Foreign Companies:  All other foreign companies shall be compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) requirements.  The countries of Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Norway are exempt from ITAR restrictions in accordance with 22 CFR 125.4(c) for the Pre-Solicitation Conference and solicitation; however these countries shall be ITAR compliant before a contract award.  This exemption will terminate on 25 August 2012.  All other countries shall obtain the appropriate licenses from the Department of State directly.  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (Other Foreign) must complete and submit the following forms:<br/><br/> - AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire<br/> - Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement<br/> - Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement<br/><br/>The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced.  <br/><br/>This announcement serves as notification that export control procedures regulated by the ITAR are in effect on the above stated data. Contractors interested in receiving this data must be in compliance with the ITAR and obtain the proper authorizations, which we encourage to do so as soon as possible.  The data will be marked Distribution Statement B  Distribution authorized to U.S. Government agencies only.   All other requests for this data shall be referred to Project Manager Soldier Weapons.  Foreign vendors and contractors shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for Contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR.  Contractors may consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and may consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions they may have relating to compliance with the Export Administration Regulation (EAR).  Please reference the following link consulting these regulations http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html.  The Contractors responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided above.<br/><br/>After contract award, the contractors will be provided Government-Furnished Materiel (GFM) to help validate interfaces and qualify suppliers. The GFM may include full up M153 CROWS systems, select parts and weapons. Contractors must make the appropriate accommodations to be approved for handling and storage of weapons. The U.S. Government support may be provided to assist in understanding the setup and use of the M153 CROWS and its operation following contract award. <br/><br/>The current schedule projects a Pre-Solicitation Conference at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on 6 October 2011 and a solicitation release in November/December 2011.  Only contractors who have pre-registered for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will be admitted.  Please reference the Pre Solicitation Conference Requirements notice posted on 1 July 2011.<br/><br/>All responses to this notice shall be in writing in the English language and at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>In the best interest of the U.S. Government, the U.S. Government intends to
change the previously stated contract type in DRAFT-W15QKN-11-R-F015 from
Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) to base with options.  The base 
with options contract type has been determined to be more favorable to the 
U.S. Government. The expected contract duration remains unchanged at five (5)
years and is intended to be a single award.

The Royalty Fee, if applicable, as referenced in DRAFT-W15QKN-11-R-F015 shall 
be added to an Offerors proposal in the total price evaluation as per FAR 
27.202-2 and stated in both Sections L & M of DRAFT-W15QKN-11-R-F015. The 
royalty fee payments shall be paid by the U.S. Government in accordance with 
the Special License Agreement. The contract awardee is not required to pay the
royalty fee.

<DESC>RFI Title: The Commander's Virtual Staff (CVS)  <br>  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTES OR AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBMISSSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO THE INTERESTED PARTIES FOR REPONSES.  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005, on behalf of the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Command, Power, and Integration Directorate (CP&I), is conducting market research to seek information regarding emerging technologies to enable the development of a Virtual Staff capability for Army Commanders and leaders.    <br>    <br>  Background and Description:  <br>  The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Command, Power, and Integration Directorate (CP&I) is requesting information regarding emerging technologies to enable the development of a Virtual Staff capability for Army Commanders and leaders. Computational technology offers new kinds and degrees of machine power that greatly expand the potential to facilitate and augment human cognitive activities - activities such as mission monitoring, situation assessment, plan generation and adaption and decision making.  Capabilities range from advanced data visualization techniques, to intelligent agents that work cooperatively as part of human-intelligent agent teams, to groupware that supports multi-person collaborative work to wearable assistive interfaces for visual, auditory and touch interaction. The Commander's Virtual Staff (CVS) will apply computer automation to assist the commander understand, visualize, describe, and direct tasks for the staff, and apply cognitive/intelligent agents to assist the commander and staff in their execution and management of the operations process, which remains incompletely automated. The scale of implementation ranges from a battalion formation employing CVS to several battalion formations working together with cooperation across instances of CVS to a brigade formation with its associated battalions, where some may not employ CVS up through a division formation.  Ideal technologies would be those that address the problem yet are extensible and able to incorporate third party contributions. The central CVS topic has been identified as having several sub-topics that are of interest:  <br>    <br>  1.	Commander/Leader specific tools. Computer capabilities that specifically support leaders perform  quote mark art of command quote mark  tasks. The concept is to provide hands on tools leaders can use regardless of location (e.g. command post, in vehicles, or dismounted)  <br>    <br>  2.	Commander/staff workflow coordination and collaboration. Tooling to assist in the tasking, tracking, production and sharing of work products and task deliverables regardless of the relative location of the commander or the staff.   <br>    <br>  3.	Data consolidation. Technologies to provide storage, enriching and searching data for a single authoritative and consistent source for Mission Command information and situational awareness that is currently drawn from multiple MC systems and often mentally fused.   <br>    <br>  4.	Planning. An integrated domain-independent planning capability that enables domain-specific knowledge to be added. Ideally the planning capability would produce several models based on previous unit performance in similar situations as well as current unit and environmental state that could be used for wargamming, analysis and driving other computer and human systems. The capability should also provide effects models that predict the outcome of selected operations/tasks.  <br>    <br>  5.	Automated assessments. Provide the commander with continually available computer-assisted running estimates and assessments based on current, future and alternative plans as well as the commander's intent. These should be available for all aspects of every type of mission including, for example, assessing the progress of preparation during the Operations process.  <br>    <br>  6.	Predictions. The ability to recognize and reason about evolving situations based on situational data and the context of the current plan/goals. Predictions should be able to be improved based on lessons learned during after action reviews (AARs) and continual corrections.   <br>    <br>  7.	Recommendations. Automatically produced recommendations, with associated probabilities and confidence levels, and alternatives for consideration based on domain-specific knowledge, goals, and situational awareness. Recommendations should be able to be improved based on lessons learned during AARs.   <br>  Keywords: Decision Support Capability, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Centered Design, Trust Research, Workflow and Task Analysis, Data Management, Ubiquitous Computing Techniques, Dynamic Network Analysis, natural language processing, supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning, rules engine, expert systems  <br>    <br>  The DoD, specifically the U.S. Army is in a unique area where emergent technologies integrated within a networked environment assist Commanders & Key Leaders, decision-making, building cohesive teams, development shared situational understand, which encapsulate the human endeavors culminated under the Mission Command Unified Land Operations concept (complexity of task and human interactions within teams that are socio-cognitive networks interacting with information networks that are built on communication networks).  CP&I seeks to understand the state of various technologies that can be combined together in unique and innovated ways to develop Mission Command capabilities outlined in the RFI.  Request industry provide information on what technology domain expertise areas are believed to be applicable to the RFI, how it would be applied to the RFI topic and a plan for further developing the advanced technology.  CP&I is constructing a Technology Development Strategy on what technologies can be harvested now for a 3-4year technology development timeframe targeting transition into a system of record and future concepts that require a 6-8 year maturation cycle.    <br>    <br>  Understanding cognitive process modeling for decision making, tools and intelligent systems that support collaborative decision making across distributed teams; Context-Sensitive information presentation may been driven by artificial intelligence, dynamic network analysis, natural language processing, multi-modal human integration, data mining and distribution.  CP&I solicits industry opinion regarding how capabilities provided by these new technologies could be developed to assist human performance with respect to the RFI concept?  <br>    <br>  This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this sources sought announcement. Responses will assist the Government in determining potential responsible sources and to determine the technical capability of the domestic production base.    <br>    <br>  Requested Information:    <br>  The Government is requesting contractors provide sufficient information in the form of a white paper which should include a description of the capabilities, technical expertise, and relevant past experience.   In addition interested sources are requested to complete the enclosed questionnaire.    <br>    <br>  All submissions must be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF (1-inch margins and 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font), e-mailed to Renee Gardner, Contracting Officer at renee.m.gardner6.civ@mail.mil , and Nina Bushnell, Contract Specialist at nina.m.bushnell.civ@mail.mil .

The Government will be required to order and the contractor required to furnish at least the established minimum quantity of 75% of the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. The offeror will be required to house a daily population of not more than 100% of the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. Additionally, the institution shall include a Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a minimum capacity of 100 beds. The SHU beds shall be additional beds used only for the SHU and shall not be used to exceed the daily population of 100% of the accepted number of contract beds.

Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based work statement based on the American Correctional Association Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions.</p>
<p>Offerors are prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates within the same fence perimeter; however, multiple populations at a prison complex with separate fence lines are acceptable. Services received from or provided to the resulting contract shall not be shared with other non-BOP contractual obligations.</p>
<p>Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government. The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued.</p>
<p>Information will be required from offerors regarding both existing and anticipated environmental impacts and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is proposed. Environmental documentation and other related information will be required with the submission of the proposal in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). An Environmental Impact Statement will be performed for this requirement. An offeror's proposal must in the sole opinion of the Bureau of Prisons, contain sufficient information for the Bureau to conduct a complete analysis.</p>
<p>This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small businesses. Faith-based and Community Organizations can submit offers equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.</p>
<p><br />The solicitation will be available on or after 1/23/2015, with an anticipated closing date for receipt of proposals on 3/24/2015.

<DESC>On behalf of the U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase from People Who are Blind or Severely Disabled), the independent federal agency that administers the AbilityOne Program, National Industries for the Blind (NIB), a designated central nonprofit agency, is pursuing potential partnerships with TAA compliant commercial manufacturers of professional grade long handled cutting tools such as bolt cutters and steel strapping cutters, suitable for use by federal government agencies.
<p>If successful, the result will be a co-brand agreement between the manufacturer of component parts and the AbilityOne Program, and its registered brands.  The ultimate expectation is that the co-branded product will be placed on the AbilityOne Procurement List (PL).</p>
<p>These long handled cutters must meet and/or exceed FAR and other Federal Government published standards, Executive Orders and Federal Agency requirements.</p>
<p>To be considered for the partner opportunity, the following criteria at a minimum must be met by the commercial manufacturer:</p>
<p>1.	Possession of a recognized regional or national brand name within the cutter tool industry.<br />2.	Manufacturer must make all component parts in a TAA compliant country, preferably in the USA<br />3.	Manufacturer must have state of the art metal forging capabilities.<br />4.	Manufacturer must have extensive experience in making industrial cutting tools (wire, metal, bolt, and cable cutting hand tools).</p>
<p>5.	Product Specific Criteria:</p>
<p>&bull;	Must meet all federal safety requirements.<br />&bull;	Cutters are made from hardened tool steel and most tools have rubber hand grips<br />&bull;	Most cutters have dual lever steel handles.<br />&bull;	Most cutters have replaceable jaws.<br />&bull;	Each cutter must meet the federal technical specs listed in the GSA IPD for that NSN<br />&bull;	Bolt cutters must be Class 3: Clipper cut (close cutting)<br />&bull;	Bolt Cutters must be made in accordance with Commercial Item Description A-A-3047</p>
<p>6.	The chosen manufacturer must be willing to set a high priority for delivering bulk materials to the non-profit agency in order to assure the agency of on-time deliveries to the federal government customers.<br />7.	All products must be manufactured and lab tested, certified and customer tested to be effective according to their purpose, have current Material Safety Data sheets if necessary, and meet certifications with corresponding documentation designated by customers.<br />8.	Must have a willingness to enter into a multi-year agreement, which includes on-going technical and production assistance and the necessary factory trained technical field support, while enabling the non-profit agency to maximize the labor provided by the AbilityOne Program.  These criteria include: converting material, manufacturing goods, assembling, labeling, and packaging products sold to the federal government, thereby creating employment for people who are blind or deaf/blind.<br />9.	A willingness to share supplier access and volume pricing agreements with the non-profit agency.<br />10.

<DESC>National Library Services for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH) requires contractor-provided services for Multistate centers (MSCs) to function as materials-support units for NLS for network libraries in two specified geographical areas of the country.  Working under the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH) on a contractual basis and relating directly to the network libraries in their service areas, the centers provide publications, equipment, supplies, and interlibrary loan service for all NLS/BPH mass-produced books and audio books that appear on the Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD) but which NLS has not made physical copies available, braille magazines on request to network agencies and to the other MSC.  They must receive, store, shelve, duplicate, manage, and distribute all NLS/BPH-issued books, selected special collections including assigned back issues of braille magazines and volunteer-produced material (including cassette, digital, and braille books selected for limited distribution); store and manage duplicating masters such as open reel tape, and cassette, and have access to BARD to download books for which a patron or library needs a physical copy; store and ship sound reproducers and allied equipment; and store and ship publications and supplies. The administrative functions of the centers include managing staff use of online and local and electronic information fulfillment systems, customer service, electronic inventory, information systems, purchasing, quality control, and safety.  Many of the Centers support services require use and management of Web-based NLS applications.
<p>The successful bidder for regional 1 would serve all of NLS's network of cooperating libraries (and eligible patrons) located east of the Mississippi River. The successful bidder for region 2 would service all NLS network libraries (and eligible patrons) located west of the Mississippi River.</p>

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address: </strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institutes on Drug Abuse, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions,
<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>This is a <strong>Small Business Sources Sought </strong>notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong>NCATS is a translational science center that prides itself on its tremendously productive pipeline and is innovative in a number of ways.  First, our quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) paradigm, which tests all compounds at multiple concentrations in the primary screen, is unique.  However, more and more academic and pharmaceutical groups are now adopting it in their own operations due to the enhanced data generation that enable compound bioactivity assessment and probe production efficiency.  This efficiency derives not only from savings in post-screen cherry-picking, reconfirmation, dose-response testing, and initial SAR assessment, but also from the ability to perform reliable "virtual counter screens," thus allowing us to make more informed decisions on which scaffolds to pursue for probe development.  Second, the NCATS is distinctive in its focus on collaboration with outside investigators to produce high-quality chemical probes to define new biology.  This focus is reflected in our unprecedented Outreach program, which reaches hundreds of potential new investigators every year, and accounts for much of the new science being done at the NCATS.  Third, the NCATS is uniquely focused on new technologies and paradigms to improve the process of probe development, typified by qHTS, our informatics platform, our utilization of structural biology to accelerate probe development, development of new synthetic and analytical chemistry paradigms.</p>
<p>As such, NCATS is working towards assembling new, high quality, focused, and well annotated small molecule libraries.  The compounds requested would be essential for our chemical libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives: </strong>The purpose of this potential procurement is the acquisition of four (4) small molecule compounds to expand on NCATS chemical library available for high throughput screening.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements: <br /></strong>The contractor shall provide the following small molecules in the stated concentrations:</p>
<p>1. CG-1021 (OC(CC(C1=CC=C(N2CCOCC2)C=C1)(C3=CSC=C3)N4)=C(SC5=CC=CC=C5Cl)C4=O) - 50 mg<br />2. CG-965 (N#CC1=CC=NC(NC2=NC(N3CCC(F)(F)C3)=CC(C4CCN(C5COC5)CC4)=C2)=C1) - 25 mg<br />3. CG-1265 (NC1=NC=NC2=C1N=C(NCC3=CC=C(C4=CC=CC=C4)C=C3)N2[C@H]5O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]5O) - 25 mg<br />4. CG-1280 (FC(F)(F)SC1=CC=CC(C2=NN3C(N[C@H]4[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@H](COS(=O)(N)=O)C4)=CC=NC3=C2)=C1) - 5 g</p>
<p>Compounds need to be &gt;95% purity as characterized by using HPLC, LCMS, and NMR.</p>
<p>The contractor is responsible for shipment of the small molecules to NCATS within 20 business days after receipt of award.</p>

<CONTACT>Phil Davis, 407-384-5335

<a href="mailto:phillip.b.davis16.civ@mail.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>20 FEB 2015 UPDATE:   <br>  <br> The announcements for ATMP can now be found at below link under announcement number W900KKATMP.  <br>  <br> https://www.fbo.gov/indexs=opportunity&mode=form&id=ba252d677a5b98488ecc5da358f9227b&tab=core&_cview=0.   <br>  <br> Announcement number W900KKWFFII will no longer be utilized.  The latest ATMP announcement includes information regarding Maintenance Data and Technical Manuals from the current War Fighter Focus (WFF) Contract. <br>  <br> 17 NOV 2014 UPDATE:  <br>    <br>  1.  PURPOSE: The purpose of this posting is to issue a Request for Information (RFI) for the Warfighter Focus (WFF) Re-compete, hereafter known as the Army Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) Maintenance Program (ATMP).  THIS RFI IS PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR SMALL BUSINESS.  However, large businesses are permitted to respond.  The ATMP Integrated Product Team (IPT), in coordination with the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Office of Small Business has identified areas within the current WFF Contract scope that are not specifically related to TADSS maintenance and therefore may not be included in the forthcoming ATMP acquisition.  These areas include: Instructors for the Medical Simulation Training Centers (MSTC), Home Station Instrumentation Training Systems (HITS) Operators and Operators for the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT).  Further, the IPT has determined that the aforementioned requirements may be efforts that can be set-aside for small business.  These requirements represent approximately $18.5M annually.  The ATMP IPT is interested in receiving responses from small businesses to determine its capabilities specific to Instructor/Operators.  The intended North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 611310, Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools.  The size standard is $27.5M annually.   <br>    <br>  Industry is advised that the ATMP IPT has no intent to separate the TADSS maintenance and sustainment requirements for ATMP.  The purpose of this RFI is to determine if areas unrelated to TADSS maintenance and sustainment can be separated to provide additional opportunities for the small business industry base.   <br>    <br>  Below is a brief description of the requirements for MSTC Instructors, HITS Operators and IEWTPT Operators.    <br>    <br>  2: MSTC, HITS AND IEWTPT REQUIREMENTS  <br>    <br>  A.

The contractor shall set-up, configure, monitor, operate, and provide all functions in support of HCC operations as a stand-alone system or in conjunction with other systems.   The contractor shall enter into Associate Contractor Agreement(s) with the Army TADSS Maintenance Program (ATMP) contractor as necessary to provide access to IEWTPT components and coordinate maintenance support.  <br>    <br>  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE/PERSONNEL STAFFING:  All contractors shall have a Top Secret (TS) Clearance with eligibility for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) in order to perform functions on ALL components of the IEWTPT system.  The contractor shall manage clearances through the Defense Security Service (DSS) Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).  The contractor, by exception may request to bring on an Individual with a Secret Clearance.  In such cases, a TS (SCI) request shall be submitted immediately.  As determined by the government and within a reasonable period of time a TS (SCI) clearance or interim TS is not awarded to the individual, then this will be deemed grounds for dismissal from the program.  The contractor shall submit a request for Special Compartmented Access with the specific tags associated with each specific site's Special Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Dismissal of an employee does not relieve the Contractor from timely work performance of the contract requirements.  The IEWTPT teams are required to support training based on a 40-hour workweek for a total of 50 weeks a year.  The contractor should maximize the use of a flex schedule within each 40-hour workweek in order to minimize the requirement for Overtime.  If the use of a flex schedule cannot support the requirements then the contractor should provide a Field Budget Estimate or Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to the customer in order to determine if resources are available to support the extended requirement.  Contractor personnel shall be required to travel to various locations including OCONUS to support training conducted in remote modes or travel to Orlando for system update training.  Planned IEWTPT locations include Yongson, Korea; Ft Huachuca, AZ; and Ft Irwin, CA.  <br>    <br>  3.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR HQ), in support of the Naval Sea Systems Command, Program Executive Office, Submarines, Maritime Surveillance Systems Program Office, PMS 485, intends to issue a Full and Open Competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for the development of Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) passive acoustic linear arrays. Based on market research, the Government determined that there were no small businesses capable of producing the required arrays within the required time frame.
The SWSS arrays are surveillance sensors used as the primary sensing capability for SWSS units which are physically attached to the arrays.  Each SWSS unit is a stand-alone, battery powered system which will collect, process, analyze the data from the array and transmit undersea contact locating information to operational commanders.  They are designed to support the Navy's littoral undersea surveillance needs in detecting and reporting submarines.  Each SWSS array comprises the following sub-assemblies: one acoustic array (to include its leader cable and terminating connector); one array interface card (physically located inside the SWSS node bottle which includes its necessary connectors and bulkhead connector), and one array dispenser.
The proposed contract will be a single award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with an ordering period of five years that will allow for the development and production of a maximum of 75 SWSS passive acoustic linear arrays.  The development and production effort will be procured on a Firm- Fixed-Price (FFP) basis.
A Sources Sought, SPAWAR Headquarters MKTSVY F1ADA dated 24 June 2014, was issued for market research purposes to determine the interest and capability of Small Business to participate in this acquisition.  Of the four responses to the Sources Sought, three were from small businesses and one was from a non-profit organization.  The Government's analysis of the Sources Sought responses indicated that none of the four were capable of producing the required arrays within the required time frame.  Therefore, it was recommended that the SWSS Array RFP be issued as a Full and Open Competitive solicitation.  The SPAWAR Small Business Office and the Small Business Administration Representative reviewed the Sources Sought analysis and concurred with the decision not to set-aside this effort.
Responses to this announcement should be addressed to James Leal at James.Leal@navy.mil. Companies interested in this RFP should monitor the FedBizOpps.com website for the release of this solicitation.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source as this is a follow-on contract, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2). <br>  <br> Follow-on modification to the original effort.

<DESC>The proposed action is for a Period of Performance (PoP) modification to Strategic Services Sourcing (S3) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract Number W15P7T-06-D-E407 Task Order (TO) number 0024 Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) with Viatech, Inc. to enable the continuation of Sustainment Support Services in support of the CECOM G8 at Aberdeen Proving Ground. To avoid an interruption of services that are currently ongoing with the prime contractor, it is anticipated that the award of this modification to the TO will take place by 13 February 2015.  The logical follow-on will extend contract W15P7T-06-D-E407 0024's POP through 13 August 2015.10 U.S.C.   2304(d)(1)(B) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C) The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.The proposed source is Viatech, 40 Christopher Way, Eatontown, NJ 07724-0479.  Viatech has been performing support services under this effort since 14 February 2010, and is the only source that has the resources in place to continue mission support.  Viatech provides subject matter experts with critical knowledge of GFEBS, LMP, Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS) and their applications to the various programs G8 supports.  Their roles include supporting GFEBS audits, as well as Systems Applications and Products (SAP) and LMP support.  The contract support that is being employed from Viatech offers an in depth analysis and standard business processes.  Reliability and the accuracy of the standard reports would be compromised due to lack of: analysis, SAP knowledge, and financial regulations without these key contract support provided by Viatech.  A six (6) month PoP extension of the current contract is required to allow sufficient time to execute a competitive follow-on effort.

<DESC><strong>This is NOT a request for quote.</strong> This is a notice of the Government's Intent to Award a Firm Fixed Price contract on a sole source basis to TEMCO Facility Services (TEMCO) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD is made in accordance with FAR subsection 6.305, Availability of the justification.
<p><br />The CFPB currently leases office space at 140 East 45th Street, New York, New York from CBRE, Inc. to house CFPB employees assigned to the New York regional office. TEMCO currently provides cleaning services at that location and it is the only company allowed to clean that building. Since TEMCO provides cleaning to CFPB's office space, but does not provide cleaning of the common areas (i.e. lunch room, pantry, etc.), the contractual agreement with TEMCO Facility Services will provide for additional custodial services for these common areas.</p>
<p>The Government will not consider any quotes submitted as a result of this announcement. The approved and executed "Justification and Approval For Other Than Full and Open Competition" will be available for public review on FedBizOpps within the next few weeks. For specific questions, please contact, Ms. Aubrey D. Brick, Contract Specialist, at Aubrey.Brick@cfpb.gov or Mr. Laurent E. Pichet, Contracting Officer, at Laurent.Pichet@cfpb.gov.</p>

<DESC>BPA No. HSCEC7-10-A-00004 was awarded on 12/18/2009 to The J. Diamond Group, Inc. against GSA Schedule # GS-07F-0305L for protective security officer services in West Texas for the period of 03/01/2010 through 02/28/2015. The current BPA Ordering Period 5 is set to expire on 02/28/2015. This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program in accordance with FAR 8.405-6, "Limited sources justification and approval." The proposed 6 month BPA extension is to acquire continued PSO services from March 1, 2015 through August 31, 2015 at an approximate value of $4,203,906.00. In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), the circumstance restricting competition for this acquisition is there is only one source capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialist. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Protective Service (FPS) has a requirement to secure on a limited source basis in acquiring a continuous Protective Security Officers (PSO) services in West Texas area until award of a competitive follow-on contract is made and completed.<br />The six month period shall allow the Government the necessary time to conduct discussions, adequately document its source selection, issue the award and allow for the 120 day transition. This LSJ is to acquire continued PSO services from The J. Diamond Group, Inc. <br />
