<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>The Naval Medical Research Center Detachment (NMRCD), Lima, Per&uacute; requires the provision and installation of new flooring in a 5,000 square foot laboratory animal facility. The flooring must meet specific requirements (see below). The current floor is a concrete slab with an epoxy paint layer. The floor has some small gaps and the epoxy paint requires too much repainting due to high transit and the need for frequent pressure washing.</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The product must be shipped to Lima, Peru and technicians must travel to Peru and be on-hand to do the entire installation.&nbsp; NMRCD has determined that there are no local sources of labor or materials for this type of flooring.</p>
<p>This project will require resurfacing of the existing concrete slab to remove paint and prepare the subfloor to accept the new product.</p>
<p>The contractor must indicate how much the current floor level will rise after application so that doors can be cut to allow space (cutting doors is not the contractor responsibility).</p>
<p>This project must be completed while animals are in the animal facility. As such, the project must be phased in order to allow NMRCD personnel to move the animals into rooms that are not being worked on. Areas being worked on must be insulated with plastic, plywood or drywall to avoid spreading dust to clean areas during preparation of the concrete subfloor. All air supply and air exhaust grills must be temporarily sealed with plastic to avoid dust contamination and to minimize noise.</p>
<p>Product must extend 6" up on all baseboards.</p>
<p>FLOORING QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>1. - It must be NON-POROUS, since it has to be cleaned with a pressure washer on a daily basis.</p>
<p>2. - It must be CHEMICALLY RESISTANT to an array of the most common surface aggressors like bleach, detergents and other cleaning products. It has to be resistant also to the chemical components of animal urine like urea and others.</p>
<p>3. - It must be VERY DURABLE to resist affects of heavy carts and cages as well as the employees' frequent transit.</p>
<p>4. - It must be EASILY REPAIRABLE.</p>
<p>5. - It must CURE QUICKLY as the facility will be under use during installation.</p>
<p>6. - It must be an ACRILYC BASED product that applies as a liquid or semi-liquid and then cures.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>The Naval Medical Research Unit - 6 , Lima, Per&uacute; requires the provision and installation of new flooring in a 5,000 square foot laboratory animal facility. The flooring must meet specific requirements (see below). The current floor is a concrete slab with an epoxy paint layer. The floor has some small gaps and the epoxy paint requires too much repainting due to high transit and the need for frequent pressure washing.</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The product must be shipped to Lima, Peru and technicians must travel to Peru and be on-hand to do the entire installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;NAMRU-6 has determined that there are no local sources of labor or materials for this type of flooring.</p>
<p>This project will require resurfacing of the existing concrete slab to remove paint and prepare the subfloor to accept the new product.</p>
<p>The contractor must indicate how much the current floor level will rise after application so that doors can be cut to allow space (cutting doors is not the contractor responsibility).</p>
<p>This project must be completed while animals are in the animal facility. As such, the project must be phased in order to allow&nbsp;NAMRU-6 personnel to move the animals into rooms that are not being worked on. Areas being worked on must be insulated with plastic, plywood or drywall to avoid spreading dust to clean areas during preparation of the concrete subfloor. All air supply and air exhaust grills must be temporarily sealed with plastic to avoid dust contamination and to minimize noise.</p>
<p>Product must extend 6" up on all baseboards.</p>
<p>FLOORING QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>1. - It must be NON-POROUS, since it has to be cleaned with a pressure washer on a daily basis.</p>
<p>2. - It must be CHEMICALLY RESISTANT to an array of the most common surface aggressors like bleach, detergents and other cleaning products. It has to be resistant also to the chemical components of animal urine like urea and others.</p>
<p>3. - It must be VERY DURABLE to resist affects of heavy carts and cages as well as the employees' frequent transit.</p>
<p>4. - It must be EASILY REPAIRABLE.</p>
<p>5. - It must be applied/completed quickly as the facility will be under use during installation.<br /><br />Plans of facility available by contacting facilities manager, Roberto Cosio at <a href="mailto:roberto.cosio@med.navy.mil">roberto.cosio@med.navy.mil</a>.</p>
