<DESC>The New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposes to perform maintenance dredging of East Rockaway Inlet, New York, Federal Navigation Project, including dredging the deposition basins.  The dredged sand would be placed in a beneficial manner along the Far Rockaway Beach shoreline as beach nourishment between Beach 27th Street and Beach 38th Street. The proposed maintenance dredging would remove approximately 300,000 cubic yards of sand from the East Rockaway Inlet and its deposition basins. Dredging would be required to a depth of -14 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 2 feet allowable overdepth.
<p>The purpose of the proposed work is to alleviate the effects of shoaling and maintain the authorized project dimensions, thereby providing safe and economical use of the East Rockaway Inlet by commercial and recreational boating interests while providing beneficial use of the dredged sand. Between maintenance operations, the bypassed sand placed at the feeder beach would be carried by littoral drift to feed down drift beaches. The maintenance operation would thus serve to place sand trapped in the channel back into the normal littoral movement that naturally replenishes the western beaches, while maintaining a safe channel for navigation.</p>
<p>Maintenance dredging of the channel and deposition basins at East Rockaway Inlet will be accomplished by pipeline dredge, hopper dredge or similar plant. The entire channel will generally not require maintenance dredging; only areas where shoaling has reduced the depth of the channel will require dredging. The dredged material would be required to meet all federal, state, and approved local criteria required by the government agencies having jurisdiction where the placement site is located.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him of the notice to proceed, and to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the basic work ready for use not later than forty-six (46) calendar days after the receipt by him of the notice to proceed (NTP).  The contractor is required to maintain an integrated production of at least 12,000 cubic yards per calendar day.</p>
<p>The work is estimated to cost between $4,000,000 and $6,000,000.  Plans and specifications for the subject project would be available in December 2018, with bid opening in January 2019.  It is the intention of the government to award in February 2019 and issue the NTP in February 2019.</p>
<p>Liquidated Damages of $2,202.00 per calendar day of delay will be assessed to the contractor until all work under the contract is accepted as complete.</p>
<p>This is an unrestricted Procurement.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY TO IDENTIFY SOURCES TO PROVIDE TO FOLLOWING REQUIREMENT:
<div>Specifications:</div>
<p>Brand Name or Equal to:  Keo Scientific NORUSCA II imager</p>
<p>Full VIS Spectrum Hyperspectral Imager Acquisition <br />This instrument should have the ability to record sequential images of changing bandpass in the range of 400 - 1000 nm.  The recommended method of changing the instrument's filter bandpass is through the use of 1 - 2 Liquid Crystal Tunable Filters (LCTFs).  The required filter bandpass switching time is &le; 50 ms at wavelengths less than 700 nm and &le; 200 ms at wavelengths between 700 - 1000 nm.  Radiometric sensitivity of the complete imaging system is to be limited by the sensitivity of the LCTFs chosen, not by any other optical component e.g. foreoptics or re-imaging optics.</p>
<p>Two different foreoptics are required: (1) a 180&deg; field-of-view (FOV) "fish-eye" lens at or less than an F-number of F/1.1 and (2) 90&deg; FOV lens at or less than F/1.0.  The foreoptics are to be changed manually by the end-user.  Telecentric imaging is not required.  Efficient conservation of &eacute;tendue from the foreoptics, through the filtering section, to the reimaging onto the focal plane array, is required at a level commensurate with industry-standard optical design tolerances.  Every attempt to minimize commonly occurring aberrations, to industry-standards, must also be made and documented.</p>
<p>The detector should be of a material optimized for imaging in the visible spectral region, and should be, at a minimum, a "1/2-inch" size.  An Electron-Multiplying Charge Coupled Device (EMCCD) or Scientific Complementary Metal-oxide-semiconductor (sCMOS) is highly desirable for fast imaging sequences and reduced read noise.</p>
<p>Also, full NIST-traceable radiometric calibration, with full documentation, is required.  This requirement holds for every pixel in the detector area.  Thus the vendor must provide evidence that the radiometric responsivity takes into account off-axis geometric effects such as those of the filter bandpass and vignetting.</p>
<p>Finally, all required cabling for non-interactive, computerized control and data acquisition is required.  Data acquisition software that runs on Linux is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Imager description from the Keo Scientific Ltd. Website:  <br />THE NORUSCA-II IMAGER<br />An important component of NORUSCA-II involved designing a compact but sensitive all-sky imager suitable for auroral studies, a component Keo Scientific provided significant input to. More information on the resulting NORUSCA-II Imager is found here. <br />The imager accepts a 35 mm diameter interference filter (or a Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter) and is eminently suitable for panchromatic or filtered observations of aurora, twilight/dawn phenomena, stratospheric clouds, and meteor observations. <br />The imager comes complete with a P.I. Acton ProEM 512B EMCCD camera (8.2 mm x 8.2 mm CCD), foreoptic(s) and filter(s) of your choice, calibration and data acquisition software.  <br />NORUSCA-II IMAGER OPTICAL SPECIFICATIONS:<br />o	Paraxial focal length: 3.5 mm <br />o	FOV: dependent on choice of foreoptic(s)<br />o	Linear FOV on CCD: 8.0 mm diameter circle <br />o	F-number: f/1.1 (180 degree FOV lens) <br />o	Spectral range: 430-1000 nm <br />o	Resolution: 100 lp/mm center, 80 lp/mm (edge) <br />o	Lens mount: C-mount <br />o	Optics Dimensions: 320 mm length, 110 mm max diameter</p>
<p>Selected Filters are:</p>
<p>VIS2 400 - 720 nm<br />NIR1 700 - 1100 nm</p>

Registration with Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System 
As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates Contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $150,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials. The FAR requires that the Contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing. To fulfill this requirement VA uses an online database, CPARS, which is maintained by the Naval Seal Logistics Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. CPARS has connectivity with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies. PPIRS is the system used to collect and retrieve performance assessment reports used in source selection determinations and completed CPARS report cards transferred to PPIRS. CPARS also includes access to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (FAPIIS). FAPIIS is a web-enabled application accessed via CPARS for Contractor responsibility determination information.
Each Contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $150,000 requires a CPARS evaluation. A government Focal Point will register your contract within thirty days after contract award and, at that time, you will receive an email message with a User ID (to be used when reviewing evaluations). Additional information regarding the evaluation process can be found at www.cpars.gov or if you have any questions, you may contact the Customer Support Desk @ DSN: 684-1690 or COMM: 207-438-1690. 
For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete. For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the Contractor s performance annually. Interim reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed. The report shall be assigned in CPARS to the Contractor s designated representative for comment. The Contractor representative will have sixty (60) days to submit any comments and re-assign the report to the CO.
Failure for the Contractor s representative to respond to the evaluation within those sixty (60)  days, will result in the Government s evaluation being placed on file in the database with a statement that the Contractor failed to respond; the Contractor s representative will be  locked out  of the evaluation and may no longer send comments.

<DESC><p>This is not a Request for Proposal(RFP), but rather a Request for Information(RFI) for an upcoming requirement for the Department of Homeland Security(DHS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA) for A&amp;E Coastal Construction/Building Science Curriculum Support for 4 counties within the Hawaiian Islands; Hawaii, Honolulu, Kauai, and Maui. The purpose of this notice is to determine whether or not there are qualified small business sources which are interested, capable, and willing to perform the serviced identified in the scope. In efforts to make a determination, the following information must be provided; (1) the availability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether interested entities qualified as small business; (3) whether interested entities fall within the appropriate North American Industry Classification System(NAICS).</p>
<p>This notice is for informational purposes only. It is not to be construed as a solicitation or a commitment by the Government. The sole intent here is to obtain Market Research. The government plans to award a Purchase Order(PO) established on the basis of firm-fixed price rates for labor hour services. The NAICS code for this requirement is 611430. Entities who are not considered a small business under the provided NAICS code are not encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>SCOPE - A&amp;E SERVICES FOR HAWAII SUPPORT<br />Hawaii's International Building Codes (IBC) requires that building construction and/or rehabilitation services be performed by, or approved by, a registered or licensed architect or professional engineer or a licensed general contractor.</p>
<p>It is understood that to some extent private individuals will undertake construction and rehabilitation activities on their own, and that in some instances (frequency unknown) such work is done without a local building permit.<br /><br />The A&amp;E Coastal Construction training we propose will reinforce permitted construction through application of model building codes. The target audience will be local officials responsible for building permitting and inspection, and engineers, architects, licensed by the State of Hawaii. This approach will also benefit private citizens who undertake new and/or rehabilitated construction themselves with input from informed building professionals.</p>
<p>To accomplish this training the Hazard Mitigation (HM) Branch proposes two (2) 2-day Architect /Engineer (A&amp;E) technical curriculum session delivered by an A&amp;E professional using coastal construction techniques including flood, wind, and earthquake consistent with the provisions of the 2018 International Building Codes. The session will be taught in Honolulu and Kahalui, and shall similar to the Emergency Management Institute's L-386 Residential Coastal Construction curriculum.</p>
<p>The length of this session is two full eight hour days (seven hours of instruction exclusive of two fifteen minute breaks and one half hour for lunch) and taught by an A&amp;E professional. The number of students for the course is approximately twenty-five (50) and should include engineers, architects, and building code officials. Floodplain management, hazard mitigation, planning, and building officials with building science knowledge may also attend. <br />Respondents to this notice must provide the following modifications to the curriculum: (1) add applicable images of typical Hawaiian building to course slide deck to ensure compliant versus non-compliant structure; (2) provide greater emphasis on general 2018 International Building Code(IBC) usage/ applicability; (3) 2018 International Building Code(IBC) provisions for flood hazards. This course is designed to train participants on FEMA's Coastal Construction Manual which is the primary reference for planning, designing, and constructing residential structures in various coastal environments.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS<br />Questions and requests for clarification must be sent to Rita Habib, Contracting Officer, at Rita.Habib.2@fema.dhs.gov no later than 3:00PM PST, November 1, 2018. No telephonic questions will be accepted. Questions received after the deadline will not be answered.

The capability is intended to support senior Department decision makers with independent analysis that informs whether or not to direct a new acquisition, continue an ongoing acquisition, or terminate a project or program.  The scope of a proposed Department-wide CEPE function is focused on programs that conduct acquisitions that are supported by alternatives analysis and independent cost estimates.  

As such, this market research will assist DOE in identifying interested and capable sources in refining the study plan and acquisition of services to meet that plan to produce a study a Department-wide Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation (CEPE).

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform this potential Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.<br /><br /><strong>Background</strong><br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS), the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Blueprint for Neuroscience (https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/), National Institutes of Health (NIH) seek to continue to make human brain tissue and related biospecimen samples widely available for research on neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders through multiple contract collection sites (i.e., the "NeuroBioBank") providing services that will actively acquire, receive, store, characterize, catalog, preserve, and distribute specimens to qualified investigators. <br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to provide services that will increase the availability of human tissue for research. The NIH intends to support multiple awardees/collection sites in order to provide sufficient critical resources for research on neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The objective is to make awards to Offerors that can acquire at least 50 donors per year (with the possibility of up to 200 unique human donors per year for a range of 250 - 1,000 by the end of the five-year contract period, if all option periods are exercised).<br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements</strong><br />Qualified sources will be required to acquire specimens, document and maintain a current inventory by entering data on the donors and tissue samples into a third-party interactive website (Section 508 compliant) herein referred to as the NIH NeuroBioBank Portal, and participate in the sharing of tissue(s) and associated data under the NIH NeuroBioBank guidelines. The NIH NeuroBioBank Portal will facilitate tissue requests and coordinate the distribution from the various brain banks to qualified scientific investigators who are dedicated to the improved understanding, treatment, and prevention of these disorders; (see NINDS, NICHD, and NIA for areas of disease focus). Various types of deliverables will be required including a collection of brain tissue and biospecimens, data, and reports. The anticipated contracts will include Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and protocols to ensure uniformity among sites when possible, and Quality Assurance/Quality Control requirements for prospective evaluation of short- and long-term specimen integrity, viability and function.<br /><br />Qualified sources should have the ability to:<br /><br />1. Provide an infrastructure to actively acquire, receive, store, catalog, characterize, preserve, and distribute brain tissue and biospecimens to qualified investigators. Tissue shall be collected in accordance with all applicable state and local laws and federal regulations. Tissue acquired will be focused on the postmortem brain, other nervous system tissues from individuals with neurodevelopmental, neurological, and neuropsychiatric disorders and unaffected controls. Other tissues including pre-mortem biopsies and surgical resections are also considered valuable resources for research and will be collected on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis.<br />
<p><br />2. Acquire autopsy reports, medical records, and other clinical data from the next of kin of acquired donors. Using these information sources as well as other validated methods including a comprehensive neuropathological evaluation and post-mortem interviews (when appropriate), determine to a high-level of confidence, the diagnoses of the donor at the time of death.</p>
<p>3. Utilize standard forms for data collection (with web-based entry and searchable data collection) and compatible computerized databases. The Contractor shall report data and an accurate index of their brain and tissue inventory to the NIH NeuroBioBank Portal, a third-party interactive website (Section 508 compliant), on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>4. Provide sufficient capacity to store and maintain biologic specimens derived from 250 - 1,000 unique human donors by the end of the five-year contract period, if all option periods are exercised. Sufficient freezer space as well as additional storage and processing capacity for non-frozen material including fixed tissues will be considered when evaluating capacity to perform these services. The Contractor should provide a climate-controlled facility with the capacity to maintain room temperatures such that freezers can function normally when all equipment is operating, with sufficient back-up power to maintain normal operation in a power failure. The Contractor shall also provide enough back-up freezer space to accommodate the failure of at least one freezer. Complete transfer of the contents of a freezer shall occur within 2 hours of an initial freezer failure. Adequate on-site back-up power to handle complete electrical power failure must be provided.</p>
<p>5. Establish mechanisms for registering potential donors for the NIH NeuroBioBank and engage in outreach for brain donation to appropriate disease advocacy organizations.</p>
<p>6. Participate in bi-monthly NIH NeuroBioBank Directors conference calls and an annual in-person meeting designed to provide updates and feedback on ways to improve efficiency, quality, and usability.<br /><br /><strong>Other Important Considerations</strong><br /><br />1. Protocols and standards at a minimum should meet those set forth in the NCI Best Practices for Biospecimen Resources established by the Office of Biorepository and Biospecimen Research. http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/bestpractices/2016-NCIBestPractices.pdf</p>
<p>2. Section 508 compliance is applicable for all systems housing data.</p>
<p>3. Compliance with NIH/Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) guidelines and 45 CFR Part 46, to ensure that the Bank has undergone annual review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).</p>
<p>4. Information Technology (IT) Security that is compliant with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) to ensure security of all data generated over the life of the contract.</p>
<p>5. Appropriate shipping licenses and permits from local, state, federal and international authorities for the safe import, storage and distribution of biological specimens, according to current regulatory guidelines, will be required, as applicable.</p>
<p>6. Procedures and protocols for safe handling of potentially hazardous and infectious materials will be required.<br /><br /><strong>Capability Statement/Information Sought</strong><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

<DESC>R--Sources Sought for Utility Energy Service Contract (UESC), Energy Conservation Services<br />Solicitation Number: W912DY_FORT_DETRICK_MD<br />Agency: Department of the Army<br />Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />Location: USACE HNC, Huntsville
<p>Classification Code:<br />R -- Professional, administrative, and management support services</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 541330, Engineering Services - Contracts and Subcontracts for Engineering Services Awarded under the National Energy Policy Act of 1992</p>
<p>Point of Contact: Eliza Lee, eliza.l.lee@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>1. Contract Information: The U.S. Government is the nation's single largest energy consumer. Due to the magnitude of funds spent on energy in support of Government operations and the steady inflation of such costs, the Government is re-evaluating its operations and reducing its energy consumption. Executive Order 13423 of January 24, 2007, states the head of each agency shall improve energy efficiency by 3% annually or 30% in total by the end of fiscal year 2015, relative to each agency's fiscal year 2003 energy use baseline. The primary purpose of the proposed acquisition is to acquire the design, implementation, and operation of a Utility Energy Services Contract (UESC) energy management project for Fort Detrick, Maryland. This UESC project could possibly be later referred to as "Detrick II."</p>
<p>2. Background: 10 U.S.C. 2913 Energy Savings Contracts and Activities, is the overarching bill for shared energy savings contracting for the DOD. The Secretary of Defense through Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 91-2 dated March 19, 1991, directed the Secretary of the Army to coordinate with the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force and with the heads of Defense Agencies to develop an integrated strategy for all Components within the service territory of each utility to coordinate activity and maximize savings. DEPPM 94-1, issued December 20, 1993, establish the guidelines for participation in Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management (EC/DSM) programs offered by or to be negotiated with public utilities. 42 U.S.C. 8256 provides information relating to utility incentive programs. Four key elements of this section are highlighted below.</p>
<p>- Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate in programs to increase energy efficiency and water conservation or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally available to customers of such utilities.</p>
<p>- Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods, or services generally available from any such utility, to increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage electricity demand.</p>
<p>- Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized by such agency.</p>
<p>- If an agency satisfies the criteria that generally apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other incentives.</p>
<p>3. Description of the Requirement: A UESC is a contracting vehicle that allows agencies to accomplish energy savings projects for their facilities without up-front capital costs and without special Congressional appropriations to pay for the improvements. Under a UESC contract, the selected UESC utility provider (Utility) will provide their own funding, provide financed funding, or a combination of their own and financed funding, for an energy conservation project that will be repaid from utility bill savings. The Utility will conduct a comprehensive energy audit to identify improvements that will result in energy savings. With coordination and approval of the Government, the Utility will design and construct an energy savings project and provide assurance that the improvements will result in savings sufficient to pay for the project over a maximum 10-year repayment period. The Utility will also develop a savings assurance plan and arrange project financing. The project energy savings will be measured over the course of the financing period. <br />4. Project Information: The requirement at Fort Detrick, Maryland includes but is not limited to interior and exterior lighting systems upgrades, installation of base-wide supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to monitor, control, and report on heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system operations, electrical system operations, and metering systems, installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays and other Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) as discovered.</p>
<p>5. Submission Requirements: The Government does not intend to rank submittals or reply to interested companies/firms. This synopsis is for Market Research purposes only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) or request for quote (RFQ). The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.

Proficiency Testing Surveys and Linearity Kits

SCOPE:

Background
All VHA Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service (P&LMS) laboratories and Ancillary Testing Sites that performs patient testing, regardless of complexity, must subscribe to an external proficiency testing program that meets the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act 1988 (CLIA  88) and its amendments; to ensure reliability of patient testing and meet accreditation requirements.  

Many testing systems within P&LMS also require validation of the Analytical Measurement Range (AMR) for an analyte both initially and at least every six months thereafter.  This can be accomplished through purchase of linearity material that is both matrix specific and spans the range of the AMR for each analyte, when required. This is addressed in 42 CFR 493.1255 (b) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) standard CHM.13600.

This Statement of Work (SOW) is requesting the procurement of proficiency and linearity materials that are not provided through the P&LMS VA Central Office (VACO); but are still required by the guidelines set forth in VA Handbook 1106.01 7.2, 42 CFR 493 Subpart H and K, and many CAP standards.  Therefore, procurement of the materials described above is not an option, but a requirement of accreditation for all VA laboratories.

Scope
The overall purpose of this requirement is to obtain a vendor to provide CLIA  88 approved proficiency testing and linearity materials, which are not already provided through P&LMS VACO funding.  This will ensure that all laboratories and ancillary testing sites that perform patient testing, within the Veterans Administration North Texas Health Care System (VANTHCS), are in compliance with VHA Handbook 1106.01, 42 CFR 493 Subpart H & K requirements, and CAP accreditation standards.  For this award, the proficiency testing program must be approved for the following CLIA specialties:  Anatomic Pathology, Microbiology, Diagnostic and General Immunology, and Routine and Special Chemistry.
  
Location
The proficiency and linearity materials will be utilized for compliance testing in the P&LMS Department of the VANTHCS System, including:  the Dallas VAMC, Sam Rayburn Memorial Medical Center (Bonham, TX), and Fort Worth VA Outpatient Clinic.

Contracting for these services will relieve the local staff of VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) of work associated with collecting provider demographic and professional information and credentialing services.  Further this contractor will assist both the local VAMC staff and Office of Community Care (OCC) to monitor the entire network of community outpatient and facility providers. Verifying credentials is an essential safety component of the health care system and the VA shall establish the qualifications of licensed medical, dental, and allied health professionals by having the contractor assess their background and legitimacy to provide care to our Veterans prior to sending them out for community care.

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Business Management Analyst, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		6135-01-447-0950<br />Name:		Battery, Non-Rechargeable, AA, 1.5V, Alkaline, NEDA 15A, PG/4<br />Description:	AA 1.5V alkaline non-rechargeable battery, NEDA 15A. UOI is PG. PG = 4</p>
<p>NSN:		6135-01-446-8307<br />Name:		Battery, Non-Rechargeable, C, 1.5V, Alkaline, NEDA 14A, PG/4<br />Description:	C 1.5V alkaline non-rechargeable battery, NEDA 14A. UOI is PG. PG = 4</p>
<p>NSN:		6135-01-446-8308<br />Name:		Battery, Non-Rechargeable, AAA, 1.5V, Alkaline, NEDA 24A, PG/4<br />Description:	AAA 1.5V alkaline non-rechargeable battery, NEDA 24A. UOI is PG. PG = 4</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			6135-01-447-0950<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None Reported</p>
<p>NSN:			6135-01-446-8307<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None Reported</p>
<p>NSN:			6135-01-446-8308<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None Reported</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no adverse impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please visit http://abilityone.gov/distributors/potential.html for more information.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than November 9, 2018and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Alaska Army National Guard (AKARNG) intends to require, on a sole source basis, a brand name requirement for the manufacturer Siemens Direct Digital Control (DDC) Disego Panel. This system enables the project facility control system to interface with the existing Energy Management and Control System (ECMS) on the base via fiber connection to the new Alaska United States Property and Fiscal Office (USP&amp;FO) building to be constructed on Camp Denali, Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson (JBER), Alaska. The procurement number is W91ZRU19B0001. The USP&amp;FO building will be part of the Alaska National Guard campus on JBER and must be interconnected to and completely compatible with the existing direct digital control system (DDC) on the installation. This is an integrated base wide mechanical control system required by the installation to control services, monitor performance and energy use. A single control vendor for the AKARNG allows for seamless integration between all facilities, simplified and reduced training cost for end users, reduced maintenance costs, and in the event of a system failure, reduced downtime for the unit. AKARNG's current system is a networked system that allows view and control capabilities to each of the 40 buildings from CFMO. This combined system needs to provide unhindered transfer of and remote monitoring and control of key building infrastructure systems, such as fire suppression, HVAC control and tank monitoring equipment, information, alarming, trending and performance monitoring from all existing and new workstations and view nodes (more than 700 across AKARNG campus). Every critical environmental and equipment-generated alarm at the AKARNG occupied buildings is annunciated to the Construction and Facilities Management Office (CFMO) alarm monitoring centers. Critical alarms from the USP&amp;FO must be capable of being acknowledged and controlled immediately upon detection through the existing infrastructure/system to enable the protection of both personnel and equipment. A critical DDC alarm in one building must be simultaneously monitored, annunciated, and controlled at all workstations on the entire AKARNG campus. This system must operate as a wholly integrated system to ensure reliable operation and control with regard to the (critical equipment, (2) safety alerts, (3) security notifications, and (4) data collection of emergency events and transfer to the data historian. In the event of an anti-terrorism threat occurs on site which requires immediate annunciation and shutdown of outside air intakes, etc. - the integrated DDC must be able to fully coordinate, monitor, control, and alarm any inconsistencies during this event from a common command/view point and initiation request.</p>
<p>The existing Siemens Direct Digital Control system has been in place for more than 20 years and is the only DDC in use for all of the buildings occupied by the AKARNG at JBER and remote sites. The Siemens Direct Digital Control Disego panel is the most compatible for our existing DDC systems, and what the server is setup to run.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability of other qualified sources that can meet the requirements identified above and inherent with the referenced Siemens DDC system. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice of intent. All responses received within 15 days of the posting of this notice of intent will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government to require the brand name for the Siemens DDC system for the AK USP&amp;FO procurement based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to allow alternate system manufacturers.</p>
<p>Submit responses within 15 days of the posting of this notice of intent via email to Virginia Trezise-Harman, virginia.m.trezise-harman.civ@mail.mil. Email subject line shall be titled - W91ZRU19B0001 - DDC. No hand delivered or facsimile responses will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT<br />The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD), Norfolk Office, using the procedures set forth in FAR Part 13, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Rockwell Automation, Inc., located at 1201 S 2nd St, Milwaukee, WI, 53204, for an  Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed price contract for inspection and maintenance services for highly specialized main propulsion and bow thruster systems onboard the NOAA Ships Pisces, Bell M. Shimada, and Rueben Lasker.
<p>The NOAA ships Pisces, Bell M. Shimada, and Rueben Lasker have specially designed motors allowing them to operate as highly effective, ultra-quiet fisheries survey vessels. The propulsion motors on these vessels are specially constructed and balanced to reduce noise and vibration. This special design allows scientists to use hydroacoustic methods for surveying marine life, and significantly reduces changes in the natural behavior of animals owing to the ship noise. In addition, the vessel can collect a variety of oceanographic data while marine life surveys are underway, resulting in more efficiently collected data. This reduced noise signature has improved NOAA's ability to accurately assess fish stocks and to compare standardized data with the international fisheries scientific community.</p>
<p>In order to maintain and maximize the useful life of these systems NOAA is looking for the OEM to inspect and maintain the vessels' main propulsion and bow thruster systems. This is to include proper function of the motors, drives, and any components that support function of these systems. NOAA intends to award an IDIQ contract with a base ordering year and four subsequent one year ordering periods.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 336611, Ship Building and Repairing, with a business size standard of 1,250 employees.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA.  A statement of capabilities must be received by 12:00 PM EST on February 12, 2018.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements.  Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Contract Specialist Alex Cooper at alexander.cooper@noaa.gov by 12:00 PM EST on February 12, 2018.</p>

<p><br />INDUSTRY DISCUSSION:</p>
<p>Background. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) insures multifamily mortgages under a variety of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) programs. The Department assumes the role of mortgagee (that is, lender) under certain circumstances, including: (1) when the borrower defaults, and the FHA-insured mortgagee assigns the mortgage to HUD and files a claim or partial claim for insurance benefits; (2) when a current mortgage is assigned to HUD by the mortgagee pursuant to Section 221(g)(4) of the National Housing Act; (3) when a purchase money mortgage is taken back by HUD to finance the sale of property owned by HUD; or (4) when an FHA-insured or HUD-held first mortgage is restructured under the "Mark-to-Market" (or its predecessor "DEMO") program or when an outstanding insured loan is refinanced and HUD agrees to a Partial Payment of Claim (PPC) on the insured mortgage and, as a result, one or more new subordinate HUD-held mortgages are originated. Collectively, this portfolio is referred to as the HUD Held portfolio.</p>
<p>The HUD Held portfolio currently consists of approximately 3,000 loans (approximately 1,000 first mortgages and 2,000 subordinate ones). M2M and DEMO Notes total 2,400 and non-M2M/demo Notes total 600. Fewer than 10% of the M2M/demo loans are in first position; almost all are subordinate to new insured or conventional financing. Due to the Department's enforcement actions and loan sales, the HUD-&not;Held portfolio may rise to as many as 5,000 loans or fall to as few as 500 loans during a 5 year period. The average unpaid principal balance (UPB) of the first mortgage loans is approximately $2 million, with the UPBs ranging from less than $100,000 to as high as $122,000,000. Although the loans have historically remained in the HUD Held portfolio for an average length of time exceeding 15 years, the average holding period is estimated to be less than 3 years, due to HUD's loan sales and other initiatives. In addition, there are approximately 4,500 202/811 Direct Loans requiring UCC Set Up and Maintenance. Approximately 58% of the current HUD Held portfolio (exclusive of M2M/DEMO notes) is performing under the terms of the original mortgages or under the terms of a modified mortgage. Approximately 3% of the non M2M/DEMO Notes are subject to workout agreements. One or more subordinate HUD-held mortgages may be created on a project whose first mortgage has been restructured under the Mark-to-Market (or DEMO) program administered by the Office of Affordable Housing Preservation (OAHP). These new mortgages are generally "cash flow notes" on which payments are due to HUD only annually from surplus cash. There are usually no reserves or escrows with these mortgages. <br />The numbers of performing loans, modifications and workouts can be expected to vary substantially during a 5 year period. The number of M2M and DEMO Notes is expected to remain fairly constant until they season enough to include in Note Sales. Properties securing these loans may be located in any of the 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands or Guam. Most of the properties securing these loans are multifamily apartment projects, and the remainder is mostly nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Many of the first mortgages have one or more escrow accounts associated with them (reserve for replacement, taxes, etc.).</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, HUD forecloses and becomes Mortgagee-in-Possession (MIP) or owner with respect to some of the properties in the HUD-Held portfolio. In a foreclosure sale, with the foreclosure commissioner, HUD advertises the sale, sells the property at foreclosure and transfers the property to a third-party purchaser. As MIP, HUD will manage the property. HUD also advertises and sells HUD-Owned projects. HUD usually becomes owner of a project by obtaining title at a foreclosure sale, bidding on the debt at a foreclosure sale, or accepting a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a HUD-Held loan. HUD also relocates tenants from defaulted subsidized properties where the physical condition standards are not in compliance with HUD requirements. The relocation, foreclosure, MIP and HUD-Owned projects are referred to as the Property Disposition portfolio. When HUD is MIP or owner of a project, HUD generally contracts with a property manager to manage the operation of the property. In addition, the Property Disposition (PD) Centers administer relocation contracts. It is anticipated that 15-20 relocations may come into the Property Disposition portfolio annually and remain in the portfolio approximately 6-9 months to allow sufficient time for payment of the final invoice. Currently, HUD has about 21 projects in foreclosure; there are 2 MIP properties and 0 HUD-Owned properties. During a 5 year period, it is estimated that approximately 25 to 50 foreclosure projects and 3 to 5 MIP and HUD-Owned projects will enter the Property Disposition portfolio annually, and about the same number will leave the portfolio. The length of time loans (properties) remain MIP varies substantially, but it should be assumed that loans (properties) would remain in this status for approximately one (1) year.</p>
<p>HUD requires a print ad contractor to perform print advertising for foreclosure and HUD-Owned sales. The advertising of these sales currently generates approximately 4 disbursements per week. The average multifamily property, currently in the portfolio, contains approximately 115 units. It can be estimated that properties processed as foreclosure or HUD-Owned sales will remain in the Property Disposition portfolio for approximately 12 to 24 months, although exceptions will occur. The management of the Property Disposition portfolio currently generates approximately five (5) disbursements per week. Each relocation action generates approximately two (2) disbursements per month. In conjunction with the sale of properties in the Property Disposition portfolio, HUD periodically makes Up-Front Grants or Loans to support the rehabilitation, demolition, or redevelopment of the properties. There may be a need to administer the disbursement on Up-Front Grants and Loans.</p>
<p>The Office of Affordable Housing Preservation (OAHP) (previously the Office of Multifamily Affordable Housing Assistance Restructuring or OMHAR) is responsible for conducting restructuring activities for the Department's Mark-To-Market (M2M) Program. OAHP is also responsible for processing other partial payment of claims on insured Multifamily mortgages outside of the M2M program. There is a requirement to direct questions related to M2M, DEMO Notes and Partial Payment Claims (PPC) Notes to the OAHP.</p>
<p>OAHP approves restructuring plans and manages the closing of restructurings, which includes the satisfaction of existing insured or HUD-held debt and creation of new HUD-held M2M/DEMO Notes. The service provider will generally interact directly with OAHP staff on all actions described below, except as specifically noted herein. After M2M closing, properties may include takeout financing (a new FHA-insured or conventional loan), with subordinate M2M debt, usually a M2M Mortgage Restructuring Note (MRN) and a M2M Contingent Repayment Note (CRN). The M2M Mortgage Restructuring Note can be in the primary position if there is no new takeout (currently 138). The majority of the M2M Notes are subordinate debt (currently 2127) which do not require a service provider to bill, collect and administer escrow accounts for taxes and Reserve for Replacements (reserve for replacement). Servicing and Accounting functions under the M2M and DEMO Notes should be handled in the same fashion as other HUD Notes, except for the unique billing and collection and issues caused by the nature of a surplus cash note and the relationship of the Post Closing Portfolio Management (PCPM).</p>
<p>A service organization is needed to provide Multifamily Mortgage Loan Servicing (MLS) and Accounting, Property Management, Relocation and Sales Servicing and Accounting and 202/811 Direct Loan Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Setup and Maintenance.</p>
<p>The Contractor must be able to interface data with FHA Subsidiary General Ledger (FHASL). In October 2002, FHA implemented a new OMB-compliant - Off the Shelf (COTS) software package to function as the FHA Subsidiary General Ledger (FHASL). The FHASL currently operates on PeopleSoft Financial (Solaris10 Operating System). FHASL uses the US Standard General ledger chart of accounts and classification consistent with the FEDGAAP requirements and Credit Reform. With this implementation FHA now has the capability to record and track budgetary resources control expenditure against available resources, and automatically produce financial statements and other reports from the general ledger.</p>

<p>3. 202/811 Direct Loan UCC Filing, Set up &amp; Maintenance</p>
<p>The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is a compilation of statutes designed to perfect commercial transactions and to promote uniformity among various filing jurisdictions. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, financing records are filed to make a public record of secured transactions between a debtor and a secured party. The financing records are extremely important in establishing priority among creditors in judicial proceedings, including bankruptcy, to determine rights of conflicting creditors. Fifty states, plus the District of Columbia, have adopted the code.</p>
<p>The contractor must track UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) filings for each loan in the HUD-held portfolio, as well as for the 202/811 requirements. The Contractor will be required to travel to the Fort Worth, Texas HUD office to retrieve and scan the documents necessary to create a tracking system.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Must have clear, simple alerts.
Product: - Ferroguard Assure 

WARNING: Do not modify this equipment without authorization of the manufacturer. Ferroguard Assure has no user serviceable parts. 

Description: 
Ferroguard Assure is an advanced ferromagnetic detection safety system for MRI facilities. It is installed in Zone 3, at or before the MRI door. Its purpose is to alert facility staff to the presence of ferromagnetic risk items approaching the MRI room doorway. Ferroguard s unique Visual Early Warning (ViEW) technology provides clear warning of approaching risk items by means of its intuitive traffic-light display. A secondary audible alert provides an additional warning if the primary visual alert is ignored and a ferromagnetic item reaches the door threshold. 
The wall mounted Ferroguard Assure sensor units contain highly sensitive magnetometers that detect changes in the MRI fringe field caused by the presence of moving ferromagnetic objects in their vicinity. The magnetometers are passive. They monitor magnetic fields only and do not emit any magnetic field themselves. 
Ferroguard Assure is installed by Metrasens approved installation engineers. Pre-installation preparation must be conducted by the facility, including connection of the facility s AC power. It is permanently kept switched on and active in normal use. 
The detection sensitivity and audible alarm volume are set at installation to levels that are agreed with the MRI manager.



Power supply: 
Ferroguard Assure requires AC power connection. The AC power is connected to the Hub Unit via an isolation switch (not supplied) as shown in the figure. Ferroguard Assure should be kept permanently switched on. Isolation from the facility AC power is by means of the isolation switch. The isolation switch and wiring to the Hub Unit are not a part of the product and are the responsibility of the facility to maintain.

Environmental Conditions: 
 Ferroguard Assure is to be operated indoors only (pollution degree 2) 
 It can be operated at any altitude up to 2000m 
 Ambient temperature 5C to 40C humidity 20% to 90% (non condensing)

<p>(a) The Government may award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>

To be considered recent, the effort must either still be in progress or have been completed within the previous three (3) years from date of this draft award notice. To be considered relevant the record should be similar in terms of complexity, scope, and magnitude. "Scope" is defined as experience in areas defined in the SOW.

At the quoter's discretion, additional past performance information may be submitted with the quote as a supplement to PPIRS.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations, the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</span></strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The National Fire Research Laboratory (NFRL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides the capability to test full-scale building structures under hydraulically applied loads and realistic fire conditions. The facility is a unique National resource for large-scale structural-fire tests to validate computational models used to predict building performance in fire. The facility allows researchers to study the response of the full structure to fire, rather than the response of individual building elements or subassemblies as is the case in current practice. Research conducted in this facility will help to provide the technical basis for improvements to codes, standards, and design of building structures for fire.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The purpose of this acquisition is for the fabrication of various components of Structural Steel Connections to be delivered to the NFRL located at NIST in Gaithersburg, MD. These components will connect the beams, girders, and columns, providing the framework for a two story multi-bay steel-framed structural assembly, for an upcoming test series in which the structural performance of concrete-steel composite floors on steel-framed structural assemblies under fire loading conditions will be studied. NIST will provide design drawings for the components. Fabrication tolerances on the specified dimensions are critical to ensure compatibility with the existing components, and to ensure that the system can be assembled together as required.</div>

<p>(xv) The following Department of Commerce and National Oceanic and Atmospheric terms and conditions apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>1352.201-70, Contracting Officer's Authority (APR 2010)<br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, Compliance with the Laws (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:</p>
<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.215-72 Inquiries.<br />Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov.  Questions should be received no later than one (1) calendar day after the issuance date of this solicitation. Any responses to questions will be made in writing, without identification of the questioner, and will be included in an amendment to the solicitation. Even if provided in other form, only the question responses included in the amendment to the solicitation will govern performance of the contract. (End of clause)</p>

<p>NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>1330-52.222-70 NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy (MAY 2018)<br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.</p>
<p>(a)	Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&bull;	Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment;<br />&bull;	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;<br />&bull;	The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />(b)	Requirements.</p>
<p>1.	It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>2.	The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.</p>
<p>3.	If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6,.07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i.	Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii.	The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4.	The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within          business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.</p>
<p>Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion.</p>
<p>Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.</p>
<p>i.	The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.<br />ii.	The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training.<br />iii.	NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor.<br />iv.	Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.</p>
<p>5.	The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees.</p>
<p>(c)	Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.</p>
<p>For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee.<br />All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:</p>
<p>&bull;	Phone: 1-866-288-6558<br />&bull;	Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org<br />&bull;	Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores)<br />&bull;	Text: (202) 335-0265</p>
<p>(d)	Confidentiality.</p>
<p>Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.<br />(e)	Remedies.</p>
<p>In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in:</p>
<p>1.	Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract;<br />2.	Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract;<br />3.	Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action;<br />4.	Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract;<br />5.	Suspension or debarment; or<br />6.	Other appropriate action.

GHSA&rsquo;s goal is to advance a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats and to elevate global health security as a national leaders-level priority. In 2014, member countries developed 11 lines of effort in support of the GHSA &ndash; known as Action Packages &ndash; that work across human health, animal health, and other sectors to help countries to achieve GHSA objectives and to meet country requirements for the WHO&rsquo;s International Health Regulations (IHR) and related animal health regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Action Packages are designed to outline tangible, measurable steps required to prevent outbreaks, detect threats in real time, and rapidly respond to infectious disease threats &mdash;whether naturally occurring, the result of accidental release of pathogens, or an act of bioterrorism. The Action Packages include specific targets and indicators that can be used as a basis to measure how national, regional, and global capacities are developed and maintained over the long-term. Progress toward achieving the GHSA targets and objectives is measured by WHO&rsquo;s Joint External Evaluation (JEE), a tool which consolidates the GHSA and IHR metrics into 19 technical areas.</span></p>

The program emphasizes systems strengthening at national and subnational levels and in multiple sectors for preparedness; laboratory; surveillance; workforce; risk communications; supply chain and related countermeasures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>GHS embraces the One Health approach, recognizing the critical role that wildlife, livestock, other domestic animals, and environment play in emerging zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential and antimicrobial resistance. Identifying and minimizing zoonotic disease spillover risks at their source in animals and a comprehensive approach to antimicrobial resistance that includes the livestock, agriculture, and environment sectors are essential components of USAID&rsquo;s contribution to GHS. USAID&rsquo;s GHS portfolio also leverages other USAID programing priorities in the areas of health systems strengthening, food security, economic growth, and disaster assistance. Healthy animals provide a safe and nutritious food supply component, and additionally, jobs and livelihoods all along the value chain from producer to final consumer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Livestock industries are huge contributors to national economies of East Africa and Ethiopia in particular. Ensuring that animals are safely, economically managed and food is safe for human consumption not only minimizes the risk of transferring zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance, but also greatly assists with enhancing partner countries&rsquo; capacity for agricultural development and participation in international trade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Global Health programming in Ethiopia with primary objectives in the areas of health systems strengthening and disease control, such as malaria and TB, also contribute to GHS targets.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)<br />(a) The award will be made to the contractor whose price is the lowest of all offers determined to be qualified of performing the required service in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items. Technically qualified is defined as meeting the minimum requirements in Experience, Past Performance and Price as listed below. No trade-offs are made. To receive consideration for an award, the offer must NOT receive an "unacceptable" rating for the non-price factors.<br />The Government may make an award based on initial quotes received without discussions with quoters. Accordingly, each offer should be submitted in a completed form, without exception to any requirements.<br />Failure to submit mandatory information for a factor, indicated by the word SHALL, will result in a rating of "unacceptable" for that factor, and the offer will be ineligible for award. It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient information for the Government to determine technical acceptability, successful and satisfactory past performance and price. Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine technical acceptability, past performance or price may be cause for rejection of your quote.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Price</p>
<p>a.Offerors SHALL complete and submit the Line Item Breakdown_Pricing Schedule with their Quote and include a price for each line item. Failure to do so will result in the offer being rejected without further consideration.</p>
<p>b.The Contracting Officer will evaluate each Quoted price to determine price reasonableness. In this context, reasonableness will be determined by comparing offered prices to one another, to the Government estimate and to pricing for previous work of a similar nature.</p>
<p>(ii). CAPABILITY:<br />a.The Offeror SHALL submit evidence of the capability to meet the minimum requirements as specified in this solicitation and the attached Statement of Work. Offersl shall demonstrate that the offeror can provide the skills, equipment, and personnel required to perform the specified type of services are available, or can become available if the contract is awarded.</p>
<p>b.The capability factor SHALL receive an adjectival rating based on the assessed strengths and inadequacies of each offer as they relate to the Experience rating with details descriptions are show in below:</p>
<p>CAPABILITY: RATING</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE Vendor clearly meets the minimum capability of the performance work statement</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE Vendor does not clearly meet the minimum capability of the performance work statement</p>
<p><br />(iii)PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p><br />To demonstrate satisfactory past performance the offeror SHALL provide documentation of satisfactory performance on two (2) past or current contracts of a similar type, size, scope and complexity, performed within the last two (2) years including references, with names and contact information of the references who can verify such past performance. Past performance information of key personnel may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance. In the case of a vendor with only one or without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the vendor will be evaluated as "Neutral" on Past Performance, providing the vendor supplies a certified statement with their quote that no past performance information is available. The preferred method of evaluating Past Performance is the attached USACE Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ). The Government's approach will be to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance. In addition to the above, the Government may review any other sources, as well as data obtained from other sources available, i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating acceptable past performance rests with the offeror.<br /><br />PAST PERFORMANCE RATING<br />ACCEPTABLE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />Neutral-&nbsp;the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past contract performance.</p>
<p><br />Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option (s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;A written notice of acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a&nbsp; pending a bilateral contract agreement.</p>

<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>

<div>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide strategic, value-based procurement support to help the Grantee achieve value for money in publicly-funded transportation and aviation projects. The Contractor will support the Grantee as it prepares tenders for complex, high-value infrastructure projects in the transportation sector. The Contractor's support should help the Grantee establish sound, quality-based, transparent procurement practices that contribute to the sustainability of infrastructure investments, support economic growth, and foster greater international competition.</div>
<div><br />BRIEF PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF GRANTEE
<p>About the Global Procurement Initiative</p>
<p>USTDA and the Government of the Philippines (GoP) established a partnership under USTDA's Global Procurement Initiative: Understanding Best Value (GPI) in 2015. The GPI is dedicated to assisting public officials in emerging economies to better understand the total cost of ownership of goods and services for infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>The GPI helps public procurement officials establish practices and policies that integrate life-cycle cost analysis and best-value determination in a fair, transparent manner. Adopting these standards improves governments' capacity to make better-informed decisions that take into account all relevant costs of goods and services over their entire life cycle. This leads to smarter, longer-term investments with overall savings to the government, and also levels the playing field for international tenders.</p>
<p>Project Background and Description</p>
<p>In 2016, the GoP announced massive infrastructure investment through 2022.  DOTr has received one of the largest budget allocations of the GoP departments, an acknowledgement of the critical need to address transportation infrastructure development and reinvestment.</p>
<p>In response to the direction of the GoP administration, the DOTr has launched numerous aviation sector projects.  These infrastructure projects seek to expand transport linkages and efficiency and improve airport connectivity.  Notable projects in airport infrastructure include, for example, the modernizations of Nino Aquino International Airport, the New Bohol (Panglao) Airport, Languindingan Airport, Davao Airport, Bacolod Airport, Iloilo Airport, Clark International Airport, and the General Santos International Airport Development.</p>
<p>The key factor is to ensure that these procurements are conducted in line with international best practices and with the use of life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA), to avoid risking poor project outcomes and low international competition. This assistance will not extend to the evaluation or award of tenders.</p>
<p>While the DOTr recognizes the importance of procuring based on best-value criteria, including LCCA, it requests resources to employ these methodologies and build the capacity of its procurement officials.  The DOTr has therefore requested support through the GPI for Advisors to assist in the implementation of its pipeline quickly and effectively, while allowing DOTr to obtain the best project outcomes for public funds.  The Advisors would help the Philippines meet its goals to achieve value for money in publicly-funded transportation projects, while helping to build capacity of internal staff to perform value-based determinations on their own after the Advisors' period of performance concludes.</p>
<p>As further background, together, the GoP and USTDA have already conducted two other activities under their partnership. The Phase I Workshop in Manila trained over 60 Philippine public procurement officials.  The Phase II Orientation Visit brought a group of 20 high level officials to the United States for 12 days, where the delegation observed best practices in value-based procurement at the U.S. federal, state, and local levels. This project seeks to continue GPI engagement with the Philippines by providing targeted procurement advisory assistance to the DOTr to begin implementing the best practices learned through previous GPI Programs on targeted priority infrastructure projects.</p>
<p><br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $940,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and background on previous Philippines GPI activities are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</a></span></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">11:59 PM local time (Angeles City, Philippines), on Monday, January 7, 2019</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

Guided Progression Analysis 
SITATM (Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm): A patented
algorithm for fast and accurate visual field threshold measurements; it is the most commonly used test strategy and incorporates patient responses in real time.
 
SITA database: The SITA normative database contains normative data for SITA Standard and SITA Fast 30-2, 24-2 and 10-2 threshold visual field test results from healthy subjects aged 17 to 89.
SITA-SWAP  / Blue-Yellow Perimetry: Replaces the Full Threshold and FastPac strategies for testing SWAP visual fields due to the much shorter test times available when utilizing SITA SWAP
STATPAC : It is a software package using normative values and patient data to perform statistically analysis to help interpret test data. STATPAC is the software, normative data and statistical analysis in HFA.
Kinetic Testing: In kinetic testing, light stimulus of fixed characteristics is moved into the visual field from a non-seeing area,
until it is detected by the patient. Typically, the stimulus is brought toward the   center from several directions and the operator marks      
the location at which the patient first detects the stimulus (threshold point). The HFA 3 provides a kinetic graphical interface with full       
180 testing range.
Glaucoma Hemifield Test (GHT): Compares points in the superior and inferior hemifield to provide analysis of test results. On 24-2 and 30-2 tests, the GHT evaluates five zones in the superior field and compares these zones to their mirrored zones in the inferior field. The GHT evaluates the severity of disturbed points in each zone pair, relative to its normal database.

Compatibility:   
Must be compatible with current Carl Zeiss Humphrey 750i Visual Field Analyzer and be able to monitor for progression of visual field changes with future testing.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, "Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items," as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a request for quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-100 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Public Notice (DPN) 20180824.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333991, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>Material Description:</p>
<p>The NSWC PHD is seeking to purchase Graco, Inc., products as described below. The parts must be new genuine Graco items. Brand Name Only. Used or refurbished is NOT acceptable.</p>
<p>We are requiring equipment that meets or economically exceeds the following specifications:</p>
<p>(1) Can be utilized for specialized Room Temperature Vulcanizing Rubber (RTV) Coating mixed with two different solvents in a specific mixture formula that will provide a 30:1 ratio of fluid pressure at a given air pressure. This ratio is extremely crucial and important so that the correct type of viscosity of the RTV mixture can be sprayed on to a surface with a required constant Dry Film Thickness reading.<br />(2) Air-Assisted model that allows for easier use to reach varying heights, altitudes, and diverse environmental conditions. <br />(3) Compatible for Metal surface painting in laboratory applications, remote testing facilities, or onboard ships.</p>
<p>The airless spray equipment cannot be used because of the current market design of the airless system spray rig configuration which will not let the RTV coating system have the proper fluid viscosity coming out the spray gun and being sprayed on the array face.</p>
<p>Plural Component spray equipment are not feasible because this equipment does not allow our RTV chemical mixture to chemically mix properly together for the reaction among the chemicals to interact because the chemicals are mixed closed to the spray gun tip.</p>
<p>The only type of equipment our spraying application is compatible with is an air assisted type equipment. The 30:1 is the pump ratio and motor ration that provides the proper air intake pressure and output spraying pressure and fluid viscosity.</p>
<p>For our application the closest model that meets the 30:1 ratio is the Graco D60, 30 Liter Spray Unit 36:1 with a DataTrak Control Unit for monitoring the volumetric flow of the RTV mixture. Without the ratio being close to the 30:1, then the formula of the RTV mixture has to be recalculated, reformulated, and retested each time a task is started. The follow items as described is compatible with our coating applications using RTV onboard ships and works with the chemical formulation and the fluid viscosity.</p>
<p>All interested companies shall provide a quotation for the following Supplies with the identified specifications:</p>

<p>It is anticipated that this on-ramp event is for the restricted (small business) pool and proposals may be requested by Service Channel to allow interested contractors to propose to a specific channel rather than covering all seven (7) Service Channels. The SEC is contemplating to set-aside for small business in certain socio-economic categories. This procurement action intends to add a reasonable number of multiple award contractors to the existing ONE IT pool, dependent on business needs and/or quality proposals received.</p>
<p>This presolicitation notice is issued for the purpose of exchanging information regarding this on-ramp event with industry.</p>

<DESC>Description:<br />This constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP), for a new indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract for construction, repair, and alteration, with design-build and incidental abatement services. The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Greater Southwest Region 7, Acquisition Management Division is the office soliciting and will administer the resulting contracts.
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.219-6, this procurement is set aside exclusively for Small Business concerns.</p>
<p>Performance Location:<br />Counties and parishes within the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas (Region 7).</p>
<p>General Description of Scope of Services:<br />This contract is to provide general construction, repair, and alteration, with design-build and incidental abatement services. The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220 with a size standard of $36.5 million.</p>
<p>This will be a firm fixed price multiple award contract. This PBS Region has been organized into thirteen geographic zones. Awards will be staggered by zone, potentially two zones at a time. All work to be acquired under the contracts will be accomplished by the issuance of individual task orders. The individual task orders to be placed under the contracts will range in dollar value from approximately $2,000 to $3,500,000; however, project values will NOT be equally spread over this range. The Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) for a contract which is primary in only the Small Projects Pool shall be $1,000,000 aggregate for all task orders for each annual period of performance, for each contract, for each zone. The Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) for a contract which is primary in only the Large Projects Pool shall be $4,000,000 aggregate for all task orders for each annual period of performance, for each contract, for each zone. A contract which is primary in both project pools will have a MOL of $5,000,000 aggregate for all task orders for each annual period of performance, for each contract, for each zone. These contract vehicles may be used by both GSA Regional and Field Office personnel. These contracts will be solicited as one (1) year contracts, with four (4) separate one (1) year option periods, for a total potential contract period not to exceed five (5) years. Facilities covered under the scope of this contract include Government owned and leased facilities in counties or parishes within the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.</p>
<p>Services will be required under these contracts on an as-needed basis up to a single task order limit of $3,500,000. Task orders will be prepared based on defined scopes of work for specific projects, and negotiated and&nbsp;issued as firm-fixed price task orders.</p>
<p>The base IDIQ contracts will be acquired using Source Selection procedures as identified in FAR 15.3 with a firm-fixed price award to the offerors who provide the best value to the Government. Offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit and price proposals. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than total evaluated price. The trade-off process under the best value approach will be used. The technical evaluation factors in descending order of importance are: 1. Past Performance and 2. Hypothetical Projects.</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to award up to six (6) IDIQ contracts per zone, to offerors who submit a proposal which will provide the best value to the Government in terms of technical qualifications and price; however, the Government reserves the right to award more or fewer contracts per zone as determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>The Government intends to make award without discussion. Therefore, offerors are requested to submit their initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms based on technical and price factors. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>The solicitation package (offer forms, attachments, clauses, and provisions) is available only electronically on fbo.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and attachments, and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. A pre-proposal conference will be conducted at the date and time identified in the solicitation package.

All inquiries must be in writing. All answers will be provided in writing and will be available on the aforementioned FBO posting.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Is there a current contractor providing the services requested? Axiom
Page 6: Would the government consider revising the TAT to seven days to be in line with other VA facilities? No, we would not.
Page 10: Can you provide additional details on your process to query the provider? In other VA contracts, we have not been provided the necessary VA tools to query VA providers, rather, the process has been to suspend the encounters with a note of the ambiguous information that needs clarification. These suspended encounters are then used to query the provider by the VA COR.  The contractor is able to query using outlook with RMS encryption.
4.Page 11: Requires reporting of Inpatient Pro-Fees, however that is not required. Should we provide pricing for Inpatient/Outpatient Professional Coding, even though it is not listed on the Price Schedule on page 18? per VHA HIM, professional fee services are considered part of the inpatient or outpatient total.
Ref. Page 6    3-day TAT . Please confirm that these are business days. If calendar days, then encounters assigned on a Friday before a Monday Federal holiday would require the contractor to complete work during non-working hours, thus unnecessarily increasing the cost to the government to pay overtime rates to SCA employees.  The 3 days is calendar days
Ref. Page 6 -  3-day TAT . All the VHA VISNs and hospitals we provide with medical coding support have a seven (7) day turnaround time (TAT).  To understand how to properly address this requirement, what is the reason that this contract requests a three (3-day TAT)?  To ensure our facility TAT
Ref. Page 6 -  3-day TAT . How should the contractor account and report on IT system downtime that could create TAT delays that are out of the control of the contractor?  This would be taken in consideration
Ref. Page 18   To properly develop SCA-based pricing the duration of the Base Period and each Option Period is required. What are the durations of the Base and each Option Period?  1 year
Is there an incumbent contractor performing this work, and if so, please provide the name of the contractor company? Axiom
As an SCA contract, the new contractor is required by DOL law and SCA compliance to offer the positions to incumbent contractor personnel. The employment information of all current staff is required to develop a price that includes the vacation and sick pay of incumbent staff performing the work, protecting their compensation.  Can the government provide a list of all the current staffs  Labor Categories and their anniversary dates so that we can correctly calculate the labor cost base? Please look at the Wage Determination.
1. Pg. 77, E.3 Evaluation - (a) b. states 3 VA references are required. Can subcontractors have 1 or 2 of the references as long as the prime has a good reference to submit? Yes.
2. Pg. 6, B.4 PWS - A.6 states Coding must maintain a minimum of 95% accuracy with a desired accuracy rate of 98% to be the goal. Will the contractor be expected to reach a 95% accuracy immediately and grow into 98%? How long does the contractor have to reach the goalof 98% accuracy? 95% is what is required, we are requesting a higher accuracy
4. There appears to be no requirement for a technical write up. There is no requirement to submit technical write up with your bid.
5. pg52, D.2 CPARS - states a requirement for registration with CPARS. Typically, CPARS evaluations are done at the end of the contract. Our companies are in themiddle of long-termcontracts. Can we submit past performance information in lieu of having CPARS ratings for our past performances? Yes, as long as it is VA references.
What software does VA Martinsburg use for coding? Nuance Encoder Product software
16.. What is expected start date and period of performance of this solicitation? On award of the contract.
17. Are there specific instructions to guide vendor responses, such as a response page limit? no
18. Will the coders have access to VA provided encoder software? yes
19. What are the productivity standards per patient type? National VHA HIM productivity standards
20. Inpatient Encounters/PTF s - What is the average length of stay for your facility? 4 days
21. Inpatient Encounters/PTF s - Of the 150 Inpatient PTF s per month   (150 x 3 = 450) does this record amount estimate include the quarterly CENSUS numbers? No, it does not
22. CENSUS   What record volume estimate will be required of the contractor during CENSUS? At this point, we do not use contractor for census
23. Inpatient Profees   What record volume estimate of Inpatient Profees will be required of the contractor? Very few per month
24. Inpatient Profees   Can these be assigned through CCM to the Profee coder? No, they cannot
25. Surgery Encounters   (10 per month) Does this include processing the surgeries through Surgical Package/Surgical Case Management? yes
26. Surgery Encounters   (10 per month) Do we need a CPT surgery coder available all throughout the month or just during certain coverage times? Will depend on our facility staffing 
27. How are these services currently being performed? By VA employees and contractor
28. What are the current contract staffing levels? 1
29. Are there incentives or disincentives in contract performance? For example, since we assume payment will be based on a transaction based structure, are there service level agreements in-place regarding transaction volumes? no

The pricing table includes three services. Should Professional Fees have a designated CLIN or are they included under OP Encounters? Surgery Encounters are also listed under Outpatient Encounters in the solicitation and have a separate CLIN. Professional Fees usually have their own CLIN. 
Per VHA HIM, professional fee services are considered part of the outpatient total.

52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items 
ADDENDUM to FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS:

This is FAR Part 13 acquisition utilizing Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures.  The Government will
award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government considering price and other factors. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Technical Capability   The Government will evaluate quotes on the basis of whether or not the offeror provided documentation that demonstrates the Guardrail system is OSHA Compliant.

Price   The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to make a price reasonableness determination. Offers that do not meet the technical capability requirements shall not be selected regardless of price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(d)  All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the review in the most effective manner.  Specifically, the Government may first sort the quotes of all Offerors by price from lowest price to the highest.  Thereafter, the Government will review the Technical Capability of the lowest priced quote only.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to be acceptable and meets the requirements, the Government may make award to that Offeror without further reviews of the remaining Offerors  Technical Capability.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to not meet the requirement, then the Government may review the Technical Capability next lowest priced quote, and so on, until the Government reaches a quote that is determined to meet the Technical Capability requirements.

(End of Addendum to 52.212-2)

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revised Description:</span><br />The Government intends to issue a new contract with a Technical Data Package (TDP) to provide Breech Reliability Upgrade Kits in order to replenish the M109 family of vehicle breech kits. The breech assembly on the M109 series of artillery vehicles has not kept pace with advances in munition propellants. The Product Manager (PdM) Self-Propelled Howitzer Systems (SPHS) has implemented engineering changes to breech parts on the M284 cannon assembly (referred to as the M284 Breech Reliability Upgrade Kit) that results in a more robust firing train assembly. Many of the changed parts are not compatible with the breech legacy parts. This has necessitated the implementation of a complete fleet replacement strategy for the affected breech parts. Therefore, the Government will procure a supply stock of M284 Breech Reliability Upgrade Kits to meet demand needs of the entire fleet of the M109 Family of Vehicles (FOV).<br />Period of performance is 1 year (12 months). First Article Testing is required. A total of 200 Breech Upgrade Kits is required for this procurement for delivery during the performance of the contract. <br />Delivery of not less than 50% (100) is required no later than (NLT) 60 days after successful First Article Testing (FAT) after contract award and at the 12th month of the base year. <br />The Government intends to solicit, negotiate and award a Firm-Fixed Price Contract type to the successful Offeror. The Government will consider all proposals from interested, responsible sources that is received by the closing date of receipt of proposals.<br />Maximum size of email offers shall not exceed 3.5 megabytes, compressed files must be self-extracting and have appropriate instructions to open. Please make sure this agency has been furnished with the following additional information: Company name, CAGE Code, DUNS Number, and the email address where you would like notices sent.<br />Interested, responsible sources will be required to submit their response via email to Sophia.L.Pace.civ@mail.mil. The subject line of the mail submission must read: Offer for Consideration under solicitation W56HZV-18-R-0152. <br />The estimated release date of solicitation W56HZV-18-R-0152 is, 13 November 2018 and the closing date for receipt of proposals is 14 November 2018. The point of contact for this action is Sophia Pace, Contract Specialist, CCTA-AL, Sophia.L.Pace.civ@mail.mil.<br />

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT <br />This is a  Sources Sought Notice ONLY.  The U.S. Government has a requirement for a single, integrated, command and control cellphone-based application in an effort to better secure the overall safety of the Corps of Cadets, staff, faculty, contractors, soldiers and visitors, at The United States Military Academy located at West Point, NY in accordance on a small business set-aside basis, provided 2 or more qualified small businesses respond to this sources sought synopsis with information sufficient to support a set-aside.  Be advised that the U.S. Government will not be able to set aside this requirement if 2 or more small businesses do not respond with information to support the set-aside.  We encourage all small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), to identify their capabilities in meeting the requirement at a fair market price.
<p>This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future.  This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service.  Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFQ or IFB or RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  The anticipated NAICS code(s) is  518210 Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services size standard is 32.5 MIL.</p>
<p>A need is anticipated for cellphone safety alert application. See attached specs.</p>
<p>In response to this sources sought, please provide:</p>
<p>1.  Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>2.  Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not.  Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>3.  Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.</p>
<p>4. Information to help determine if the requirement for a <span style="margin: 0px; color: black; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">cell phone safety alert application</span>&nbsp; system is commercially available, including pricing information, basis for the pricing information (e.g., market pricing, catalog pricing), delivery schedules, customary terms and conditions, warranties, etc.</p>
<p>5.  Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.</p>
<p>6.  Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition.  Please contact the MICC-WP, Maureen Flanagan, at Maureen.a.flanagan2.civ@mail.mil 845-938-4490, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition.  Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the FedBizOpps notice.  Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
<p>7.  Recommendations to improve the approach/specifications/draft PWS/PRS to acquiring the identified items/services.</p>

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service (USFS) is interested in establishing an alternative source for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Specification for Long Term Retardant, Forest Fire, Aircraft or Ground Application, 5100-304c (NAICS code 115310 or 325180).  The current sole source vendor is Perimeter Solutions. The product must be provided in locations, volumes and time constraints dictated by the contract which can fluctuate based on the severity of the fire season.  The annual estimated volume of retardant utilized in the United States is 26M gallons.  The annual value of the retardant and services to deliver, mix and load retardant exceeds $100M.
<p>In order to support the establishment of alternate sources, the USFS is holding an industry day on 15 November 2018 from 0800 to 1200 local time at the Best Western Vista Inn, 2645 W Airport Way, Boise, ID in the Bitterroot Room. The USFS will provide background information on the long-term fire retardant program; technical information regarding the specification, testing, and qualification process; and potential opportunities for Government contracts, to include exclusion of sources to establish or maintain alternative sources in accordance with FAR 6.202.  There may also be specific opportunities for small businesses.</p>
<p>At the industry day the USFS would like to hear from interested parties regarding their interest, perceived limitations of market entrance, performance and price risks, desired guarantees, and other topics which would promote an increase in manufacturers and suppliers.  The results of this market research will contribute to an approach that the USFS uses to support alternate sources, especially small business concerns.</p>
<p>The USFS has testing and approval procedures established for the evaluation of products that suppliers propose for use by the USFS and its cooperators during wildland fire management operations. All products submitted under the established Qualification Requirement (QR) must meet U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Specification for Long Term Retardant, Forest Fire, Aircraft or Ground Application, 5100-304c with amendments. The current specification can be found at www.fs.fed.us/rm/fire/wfcs/documents/304c.pdf. Products that do not meet all requirements of specification 5100-304c will not be considered. Qualification testing and evaluation costs for small business will be borne by the USDA as provided by FAR 9.204(a)(2).<br />If your organization has the potential interest or capacity to meet the qualification requirements and provide products and related services as required, please attend the industry day and/or provide the following information: 1) organization name, contact name, address, email address, website address, telephone number, and size and type of ownership for the organization; and 2) tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability.</p>
<p>There is no solicitation at this time. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial liability for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses or procured through full and open competition, and multiple awards may be made. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.</p>
<p>Submission instructions: Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to provide the products and related services listed above are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by 26 November 2018 at 1200 Mountain Time. All responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to the retardant contracting officer, Larry Robillard at larryrobillard@fs.fed.us.</p>

<DESC>This new contract is in support of an emergency declaration that has been approved by the President on October 9, 2018, under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq. (the "Stafford Act") for the state of Florida resulting from Hurricane Michael. The products and services purchased  will be used in recovery from major disaster declared by the President.
<p>This action will award a firm fixed price purchase order to Rubb, Inc. (CAGE Code 6Y093), 1 Rubb Lane Sanford, ME 04073-2231.</p>
<p>NSWC-PCD LCAC project has an urgent need to repair customized structures used to house the LCAC vessel, which sustained damaged from Hurricane Michael.</p>
<p>The equipment was designed specifically to provide cover for 6 LCAC and subsequently items related to the support of the LCAC. Rubb Inc. was the original manufacturer and has all of the proprietary data needed to fabricate the replacement fabric cover. To reverse-engineer the fabric templates would be extremely costly and time consuming which is not acceptable considering the emergency nature of the need to recover from Hurricane Michael. Further, delays can result in additional damage to items exposed long term to the environment.</p>
<p>As such, the Government does not expect significant savings through competition and does expects significant and unacceptable delays that will negatively impact this requirement. Therefore, it is in the Governments' best interest to award on a sole source basis to Rubb, Inc.</p>
<p>$391,214 award with one option to fix doors and rollers as misc.</p>
