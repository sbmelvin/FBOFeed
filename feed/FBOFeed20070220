<DESC>DESCRIPTION
Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance-Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) SOL BAA 07-23, DUE: 26 March 2007; POC: Dr. Brian Leininger, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (571) 218-4529.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Information Exploitation Office (IXO) is soliciting proposals for the Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance-Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) program under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).

BACKGROUND:  
Finding, tracking and monitoring events and activities of interest on a continuous basis remains one of our highest Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) requirements.  Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) including the Predator Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) serve as one of the warfighter's primary and most responsive means for surveillance and gathering intelligence information and are becoming vital assets in military operations.  This is demonstrated by their significant use in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  Lessons learned from these operations indicate that UAVs provide critical capabilities for enhancing situational awareness, intelligence gathering and force protection for our military forces.  Current UAS high-resolution electro-optics (EO) offer a narrow high-resolution field of view (FOV).  This narrow FOV is a limiting factor on the utility of the EO system.  The UAS that are available offer persistence; however, the effectiveness of the EO system is limited by the sensors and available processing.

ARGUS-IS will advance technologies and systems that will enable wide area persistent surveillance thereby provide greatly enhanced situational awareness to the warfighter. These technologies and systems will be transitioned to various partners and customers. Participants will work closely with the transition partners to aid in this process.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION:  
The objective of the ARGUS-IS program is to develop a system that provides a real-time, high-resolution, wide area video persistent surveillance capability and transition this capability to the military.  The ARGUS-IS program is seeking to provide an expanding range of capabilities enabling wide area persistent surveillance.  ARGUS-IS is composed of three major technology components/subsystems, a Gigapixel Sensor Subsystem, an Airborne Processing Subsystem and a Ground Processing Subsystem.  The ARGUS-IS Airborne Subsystem is formed by integrating the Gigapixel Sensor and Airborne Processing Subsystems together.  The packaging of the airborne subsystems should be compatible with a variety of UAS including Extended Range/Multiple Purpose (ER/MP), Aerostat, and A-160 (Hummingbird).  The ARGUS-IS system will be tested and evaluated during a series of flight experiments utilizing a surrogate UAV.  It is expected that a 200 megabit per second data link will be utilized for these flight experiments.  

The goal for first set of capabilities that are being developed is to provide multiple video windows within the field-of-view (FOV) that are being continuously imaged via a gigapixle sensor.  The desire is to transmit each video window to a user on the ground, which would look like a dedicated sensor within the gigapixel sensor's FOV.  The types of functionality for each of the video windows includes; operating at variable resolutions, variable update rates, electronically steerable video windows from anyplace within the system's FOV, have the ability to track a designated target within a window and keep the target within the video window's FOV.  Further functionality is envisioned through the addition of a moving target indicator (MTI) mode for vehicles.  In this mode the system will track all vehicles within the FOV.

The Government is interested in solutions to the following components/subsystems:

- Gigapixel Sensor: The Gigapixel Sensor is a complete subsystem containing the focal plane arrays, optics, gimbal, mechanical stabilization and a means of controlling where the sensor is pointed.
- Airborne Processing and System Integration: The Airborne Processing Subsystem takes the pixels produced by the Gigapixel Sensor and does all necessary image processing.  The Airborne Processing Subsystem consists of the airborne processing hardware, software, and data recording.  This effort also includes the integration of the airborne elements into an airborne subsystem and the integration of the airborne and ground subsystems.
- Ground Processing: The ground processing provides for the data link management system control and system information distribution.  The system software will operate in the server in conjunction with a set of distributed common clients to provide for integrated ground functionality that can be easily integrated into current and future warfighter ground station systems.

ARGUS-IS will be composed of three phases, the first phase is a design and component build phase, followed by a video window and moving target indicator phases.    At the discretion of the Government,  the initiation of later phases (i.e., Phases 2 and 3) is contingent upon the availability of funding and the Government's determination that system-level performance goals established for earlier phases were met.
- Phase I - Design and component build: During Phase 1, the design of the overall system and subsystems will be performed.  In addition, critical elements of the subsystems may be built.  This includes both critical hardware elements as well as software elements.
- Phase 2- Video Window Functionality: During Phase 2, the ARGUS-IS Subsystem build will be completed, the subsystems integrated together and the Video Window functionality will be demonstrated in a series of flight experiments.  It is expected that the first flight experiment will happen midway through this phase of the program.  At the end of this phase of the program, this functionality may be transitioned by DARPA to interested research, industrial, and operational military communities.
- Phase 3- Moving Target Indicator: During Phase 3, the MTI functionality will be integrated into the operational software and flight tests of this capability will take place.  

SELECTION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be selected through a technical/ scientific/ business decision process, with technical and scientific considerations being most important. Evaluations will be performed using the following criteria, listed in descending order of relative importance:  (1) Technical Innovation and Depth; 
(2) Relevance to the ARGUS-IS Mission Objectives and Consistency with ARGUS-IS Program Concepts; (3) Cost Realism and Reasonableness; (4) Realism of Proposed Schedule; and (5) Personnel and Corporate Capabilities and Experience.  Further details may be found in the PIP, which can be accessed at the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address provided in the next section.

TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES:  DARPA intends to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding BAA 07-23.  Technical, contractual, or administrative questions must be submitted to - BAA07-23@darpa.mil.  Answers to all questions generally relevant to the technical, contractual, and administrative aspects of the solicitation will be posted for public access at http://dtsn.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations.asp#0723 under the title Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement and to award without discussions.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)/Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of technology for exclusive competition among these entities.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to negotiate with BAC/PAC Resources Children?s Hospital Oakland, 747 52ND Street, Oakland, CA 94609, to purchase genomic DNA Library resources.  The products to be purchased are all BAC/PAC genomic DNA Library resources that are offered to academic and scientific research institutions on a cost recovery basis.  The Government intends to purchase one hundred and twenty (120) high density filters. The period of performance will consist of four (4) months. 

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the use of DNA clones from the BAC/PAC Resources Children?s Hospital Oakland have been used over the past five (5) years.  We must continue to purchase these items in order to avoid the introduction of new variables into the experimental results and to avoid long delays resulting from retesting of products from other potential suppliers.  Also, changing variables at this time would result in incorrect interpretation of the test result already in progress.  An award to any other source for the items would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339999 and the Size Standard is 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The NAICS Code and Size Standard are  541330 and $4.5M, respectively. Design of an Emergency Egress System for the Crew Launch Vehicle at Launch Complex 39B at John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida.   This synopsis specifies the Government’s requirement.  There is no separate solicitation package.   The Emergency Egress System (EES) is planned to provide a safe mode of emergency egress from the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) to a safe location via a multi-vehicle, rail system for the flight crew, closeout and contingency crews, and ground operations personnel.  The rail system vehicles will have an entry point located on the crew access level of the yet to be designed Mobile Launcher Tower (MLT; ~367 ft. above ground level) and exit point at a safe location a distance of at least 1200 ft. west of entry point at ground level.  The Architect and Engineering (A&E) firm will be responsible for the portion of the EES starting at the vehicle loading area on the MLT crew access level and ending at the safe location.  The MLT will provide the access to assemble, test, check out, service, transfer to the pad, launch, perform on-pad abort, and post launch securing of the Crew Launch Vehicle/CEV.  The MLT will provide structural support for the vertical or near-vertical travel of the EES rails and rail vehicles as well as contain the loading area.  Attached is a general preliminary concept of the MLT.  The MLT is rolled from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the pad and back for each launch flow.  The general requirements of the Emergency Egress System include, but are not limited to: the total egress time from CEV hatch to the safe location for 15 able-bodied personnel shall not exceed two minutes (with 30 seconds allotted for transport from the CEV to the EES vehicle loading area); the system vehicles shall accommodate astronauts in space suits, rescue workers in fire suits and ground support personnel in ordinary clothing; the system must be able to accommodate up to nine incapacitated crew/pad personnel to safely egress to the safe location; the system shall be capable of experiencing two (2) failures and still operate; the system shall remain operational after a total launch pad power failure; the system shall be a passive system requiring human action to start, but no human action to stop; the vehicle restraint systems shall be minimum with little or no human intervention at the loading and landing areas; the system shall provide a clear route from the vehicle loading area on the MLT without steps or stairs and the loading and unloading areas shall facilitate simultaneous entrance and exit of personnel.  The vehicle launching mechanism from the MLT shall be unpowered, and gravity or mechanically driven with minimal to zero degree ramp angle for personnel loading.  The professional services required for this project may include, but will not necessarily be limited to conducting field investigations, topographical and geotechnical surveys, soil testing and analysis of existing and planned work and support systems and to prepare engineering reports of recommended action and/or design packages. The firm will be selected to develop a complete design package for the Emergency Egress System and to provide studies, surveys, reports, environmental permit applications, environmental certificates of compliance and at the discretion of KSC, to perform other professional and incidental services for the subject project, such as project and construction management support in all phases of the work throughout design, advertisement and award period and construction. This may include review of shop drawings, resolution of problems, providing of inspection services in the post design phase of the project and record construction drawings. The A&E shall have knowledge of different types of construction methods and be responsive to changes in direction. The professional services required for this project will require multi-disciplined engineering skills for performance of the required work.  The selected firm’s project staff must include, as a minimum, specialists with demonstrated experience in the following disciplines:	Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering (with environmental engineering experience), Electrical Engineering, Human Factors Engineering, and Project Management with combined demonstrated experience in the design of large scale multi-vehicle rail systems with special purpose vehicles, rail systems employing movable rail sections, rail systems in coastal and/or corrosive environments, and lightning protection for the systems.   The firm shall have the capability to provide engineering calculations and computer modeling and simulation of the Emergency Egress System.  The firm shall have demonstrated experience in rail system analysis, procurement and performance specification preparation, material and equipment standards preparation, construction management and development of operating and maintenance documentation, including spares provisioning, as well as failure and hazard analysis. For state-regulated permits, the A&E shall have staff with Professional Engineering license in the state of Florida. The design effort for the proposed Emergency Egress System may require site investigations, integrating project requirements, and close coordination with other projects, especially the design of the Mobile Launcher Tower.  The final design will be utilized for the advertisement and award of a fixed price construction contract.  All packages prepared by the firm will include detailed cost estimates and schedules.  The selected firm will provide design services and technical assistance during bidding.   For informational purposes, the construction magnitude of the project is currently estimated to be within a range of between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Fixed price delivery orders will be negotiated with the selected A&E.  The contractual instrument will include NASA FAR Supplement clause 1852.209-71, Limitation of Future Contracting, such that the successful A&E will be prohibited from competing for the follow-on construction effort as either a prime contractor or first tier subcontractor.  The A&E firm will be selected in accordance with the evaluation factors described below.  A responding firm must tailor their submittal to the specific requirements of this synopsis.  The submittal shall not exceed 80 pages.  The following are areas of particular interest for the  Emergency Egress System:  the rail vehicle passenger restraint system, the vehicle braking system, the section of rail that will connect the portion of the system that is supported by the MLT and the section that will remain at the launch pad, configuration of the vehicle loading and unloading areas, the potential forces that personnel will be subjected to while in the vehicles, and the ability to safely and effectively load and transport incapacitated personnel.   The 80 page limit includes the Standard Form 330 and additional information the offeror may need to adequately respond to the requirements of this synopsis. Only the first 80 pages of an offer that exceeds the page limitation will be evaluated.

		(A)  Customer name and address
		(B)  Point of contact (name, telephone number) for contractual/administrative matters and technical performance.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NESDIS Acquisition Division, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for ground systems engineering and depot support services for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the WindSat Coriolis satellite program on a full and open competition basis using the procedures outlined in FAR 15. The Standard Industrial Code is 541990, and the business size standard is $6.5M.

The successful contractor shall provide all necessary personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities to provide ground systems engineering and depot support services in the following five engineering areas: 1) Hardware Maintenance and Depot Support; 2) Ground Systems Engineering for Inter-Segment Interfaces; 3) Sustaining Engineering, Independent test analysis and Problem isolation; 4) Creating/Modifying Technical Documentation for DMSP C3 operations; and, 5) Integrated Program Office Polar Program Component and Operational Systems Modification. This is an on-going effort and no interruption or down time of the systems will be acceptable for any of the segments.

The DMSP Command, Control, and Communications (C3) system is an earth based command, telemetry, and data processing system providing all functions for the state of health maintenance, communications, sensor payload data retrieval and dissemination, and launch and early orbit support for the DMSP constellation. The C3 system consists of, but is not limited to: the Suitland Operations Control Center (SOCC), Suitland, MD; Environmental Satellite Operations Center (ESOC), Schriever AFB, CO; the Payload Integration Test Facility (PITF), Vandenberg AFB, CA; Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) ground stations at Hawaii, Thule Greenland, New Boston, NH; NOAA ground stations in Fairbanks, AK; user sites at Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), Omaha, NE, and Fleet Numerical Meteorological Operations Center (FNMOC), at Monterey, CA. Other operational support nodes include Onizuka AFB, CA and the DMSP SPO at Los Angeles AFB, CA.

The Coriolis Mission Data Recovery and Distribution (MDRD) system consists of X-band receive equipment at the NOAA ground station in Fairbanks, AK and SvalSat Ground Station in Svalbard Norway, ground and satellite-based communication links between these ground stations and CONUS, and a ground based CONUS distribution network with nodes at SOCC, FNMOC, and the Air Force Research Laboratory at Hanscom AFB, MA.

The Government anticipates award of a cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract. The resultant contract shall be for a period of one year commencing on or no later than June 1, 2007 and will include four successive 12-month option periods. Contractor personnel working on hardware and software components of the DMSP system are required to have a DoD Secret clearance as a minimum on the date of award of the contract. In addition, the contractor must be able to begin work on June 1, 2007 with appropriate levels of skill and knowledge and personnel with security clearances to preclude any gaps in ground system support services. For informational purposes only, the Government estimates an annual level of effort of approximately 24,435 labor hours to perform these services.

The solicitation for this acquisition will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fedbizopps.gov, on or about 15 days from the date of this notice. All future information regarding this acquisition, including amendments, will be distributed solely through this website. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available. Interested firms are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendment (if any) and monitoring the website to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition. All evaluation factors will be outlined in the solicitation. Technical evaluation factors (i.e., technical approach, past performance, and staffing plan/personnel) are significantly more important than price.

All responsible sources registered with the Central Contractor's Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov) may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Proposals/offers shall be submitted in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the solicitation document.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Engineer Research and Development Center is soliciting for a custom designed 70-mer oligonucleotides representing all known Fathead minnow genes with appropriate controls for hybridization (approximately 20,992). THIS REQUIREMENT IS AN UNRESTRICT ED PROCUREMENT. DNA must be synthesized at 50 nanomolar scale. The service must be fast, accurate and able to deliver oligonucleotides within one week of placing the order. The oligonucleotides must be designed to detect the publicly available fathead 1842 4 UniGene clusters present on the GenBank database for which orientation is known. Oligonucleotides must be designed for each strand of the additional 880 Unigene clusters that have contradicting information regarding their orientation. Oligonucleotides mu st be designed for each strand of 699 unique cDNA sequences not present in GenBank public database. The 699 sequences are derived from clustering and BLAST analysis of 4,200 cDNA sequences provided by ERDC Vicksburg, MS. Oligonucleotides suitable to assess  quality and specificity of hybridization must be design to include at least 90 control oligonucleotides to assess cDNA position effects, at least 50 negative control oligonucleotides, at least 150 control oligonucleotides with different percentages of seq uence identity to a target cDNA in order to assess specificity of hybridization. Oligonucleotide design must ensure that oligonucleotide melting temperatures are optimal within the designed set of all oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide secondary structure a s determined by self alignment using dynamic programming must not interfere with hybridization. The oligonucleotide sequence specificity with regard to other target sequences in the set must be sufficiently low as to eliminate cross hybridization. The sequ ence quality of CDNA sequences used for oligonucleotides design must account for sequencing quality scores. The design process must use global optimization where all possible probes in all sequences are considered. The oligonucleotide quality scoring proce ss must consider all design criteria simultaneously to guarantee the best overall probe. The oligonucleotide specificity must be assessed by comparison of all possible pairwise alignments with all other sequences in the set and against all publicly availab le sequences to guarantee specificity in a conservative manner. The following information about all probes must be supplied with synthesized oligonucleotides: The probe ID, target sequence name and class (genes/controls), position of the probe on the targe t sequence, probe oligonucleotide sequence, global probe score, and individual probe scores for Tm, secondary structure, lowcomplexity, specificity, position. Quality Control for oligonucleotide synthesis must include: 100% Trityl monitoring of each base a ddition on every oligonucleotide  A real-time in-process digital Trityl monitoring system must be used to identify both base addition success and presence of full length product. Measurements must be taken at the capping, oxidation, and coupling steps for  every base addition of every oligonucleotide in every well of every plate. Measurements must be taken without stopping or disrupting the synthesis process. Measurements must be compared to standard, length dependant absorbance curves. Absorbance values be low established threshold criteria should trigger failure of the synthesis. 100% of the oligonucleotides must be analyzed by OD260 absorbance measurement. 100% of the oligonucleotides must be analyzed by capillary electrophoresis - A CE system capable of s ingle base resolution must be used for quantitative determination of purity and full-length yield for oligonucleotide synthesis. Reagent delivery and oligonucleotide synthesis must be in an enclosed, inert environment. Oligonucleotide synthesis must take p lace in a 384-well microplate. Oligonucleotides must be normalized to equivalent concentrations and aliquoted into a 384 well format. All remaining oligonucleot ide yields should be placed in a 96 well format. The Request for Quote (RFQ) will be issued on February 20, 2007, with a closing date of March 7, 2007. The RFQ will be available the Army Single Face to Industry at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi. Hard co pies will not be available. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the web page for the release of the RFQ (and amendments, if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFQ and any amendments. The NAICS Code i s 325413 and the Size Standard is 500.

This requirement’s NAICS code is 517110. This is not a solicitation announcement.  This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. You are requested to provide electronic responses (20 page maximum (including attachments)) via e-mail to the primary Point of Contact(s) (POC) for this requirement.

It is insufficient to provide only general brochures or generic information.  Copies of your capability statement(s) may be made available to this requirement’s Prime Contractor competitors in the future and should therefore not contain company-sensitive information. KSC is also interested in potential prime contractor feedback related to subcontracting opportunities, given the possibility this action may be competed on an unrestricted basis.

<DESC>This notice is a form of market research and serves as a Request for Information Only:

The Department of State?s European Logistic Support Office (ELSO) seeks to identify European sources of American style household appliances (Washing Machines, Dryers, Ovens, etc).  ELSO currently purchases bulk quantities of American style products, which it receives via sea freight from the United States, and subsequently sells units to American Diplomatic Posts throughout the Europe, Africa, and Asia.     

In an effort to streamline its supply chain, ELSO seeks major brand name manufacturers with operations in continental Europe that produce appliances destined for the American marketplace (120V 50Hz). Ideally, ELSO hopes to significantly reduce delivery lead times while maintaining the major-brand name quality (Maytag, GE, Whirlpool, etc) that its customers expect and demand. 

Interested parties may send information to Thomas Lemole at (LemoleTC@State.gov).  

The Department of State currently seeks information only and does not solicit any supplies or services of any kind by this notice.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposals. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.

The Coast Guard is looking for sources/vendors capable of providing a replacement for the HH-65 Auto Pilot system.  This solicitation has been issued to survey the market to identify suitable candidate systems for consideration.  The H-65 avionics system modernization plan includes the incorporation of the US Army Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) now being installed in the Coast Guard H-60 aircraft. Current H-65 autopilot system specifications are attached for review.  The Coast Guard is seeking an autopilot system that meets or exceeds the current system capabilities. Potential suppliers are encouraged to review the attached documents and provide written suggestions to the contracting officer.  

Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC?s and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POC?s for civilian users for general usage of product questions.     After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the FEDBIZOPS. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not an adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.     Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. All companies that can meet the specification are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company literature, brochures, or any other information that demonstrates that the specification can be met.   Telephone responses will not be accepted.     Responses must be received no later than 27 February 2007 at 3 p.m. EST.     This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only.     All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.     All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.     Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation. Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

Point of Contact

The Coast Guard is publishing this request for information and will consider suggestions from qualified suppliers.  Suggestions must be received at the following address no later than 27 February 2007.  

              HH-65 Product Line Division
  Attn: Tabitha Bakely
              USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center
              Elizabeth City, NC  27909-5001

Advance copies may be sent by e-mail to Tabitha.L.Bakely@uscg.mil  including the following in the subject line ?H-65 Autopilot  Comments, Company Name?.  Correspondence must include a company point of contact with address, phone number and email address.

The Coast Guard will consider the information provided by qualified suppliers in the development of the avionics modernization plan for the H-65.

Additional Project Details

1.0	Scope
The Autopilot system may be installed in all H-65 aircraft.  The requirement will include spares.  The system and associated support plans will be designed to minimize Coast Guard inventory requirements.  Additional systems may be acquired if the H-65 fleet is expanded.  

2.0	Background
The Coast Guard currently operates (97) H-65 aircraft.  The fleet is being expanded to 102 aircraft.  The Coast Guard H-60 fleet is in the process of being upgraded by incorporation of the US Army Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS).  The Coast Guard is seeking to simplify logistics and reduce total engineering development cost by incorporating the CAAS system in the H-65.   

The current H-65 autopilot system is described in the attached documents.  This system has performed extremely well in service.  Unfortunately, the current autopilot system is no longer in production and would require costly modifications to integrate with planned avionics system improvements.  The replacement system must meet or exceed the current system capabilities.  As the respondents review the attachments, careful attention should be directed at the following sections:

	Attachment (1): Avionics System Specification USCG HH-65A Helicopter
		Section 3.1.1.1 	Normal Flight Envelope
		Section 3.3.4 		Flight Control
		Section 3.5 		Design Requirements for Equipment
		Section 3.6		Qualification Requirements
		Section 4.2 		Flight Management Subsystem
		Section 4.3 		Flight Control Subsystem

	Attachment (2):  Flight Control Subsystem Specification USCG HH-65 Helicopter
		Section 3.0 	General Requirements
		Section 4.0	Functional and Operational Requirements
		Section 4.2	Flight Director System (particularly the available modes).

Note:  the attachments, especially the flight control specification, provides a detailed description of the current system.  The modernized system must provide the same functionality, or better.  However, the system architecture may be completely different.

The HH-65 is a derivative of the Eurocopter Dauphin aircraft.  The current configuration is similar to the AS 365N3.  The aircraft was originally built to FAR part 29 standards.  Modifications to the aircraft are designed to current FAR 29 standards with exceptions approved for Coast Guard specific requirements.  

3.0	Modernization Planning

The H-65 avionics systems improvements will replace existing equipment with current available commercial and government-supplied components.  The system will include dual Honeywell HG764/GU Embedded GPS Inertial Navigation systems (EGI) and a HG7210CA01 RADAR Altimeter system (RADALT).  The flight management system will be incorporated in the Collins CDU-7000.

The system will be fully integrated with the flight management system.  The complete system will be capable of full control of all axis of flight from a stable hover to flight and back to a stable hover at a designated position.  

Autopilot mode annunciation will be incorporated into the CAAS display system.  All lighting, displays, controls and indicators will be optimized for viewing with the unaided eye and compatible with aircrew Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations.  

For planning purposes, it should be assumed that the autopilot system will be certified under FAR 29.  However, the Coast Guard will work in partnership with NAVAIR for the airworthiness certification.

3.1	Support
A Support By the Hour (SBH) support strategy is desired.  The support structure will be based existing Coast Guard support contracts.  The support strategy will be included in the system procurement process.  

3.2	Open Architecture
The Autopilot will be designed to incorporate an open architecture to the greatest extent possible and use standard government and commercial protocols.  The system should minimize proprietary interfaces and systems.  Data developed at government expense will be used by the government without restriction.

4.	Vendor Qualification
The supplier must be an original equipment manufacturer for autopilot systems.  The supplier must have been approved by the US Department of Defense (DOD) or GSA (or equivalent as determined by the best value source selection team) as an aircraft autopilot supplier or have been included as part of an approved supplemental type certificate for installation of autopilot systems on US commercial aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration.  

The supplier must have experience working with civil and military airworthiness authorities.  The supplier must explain in their response how they would certify the airworthiness of the installation.

The supplier must have or establish a permanent presence in the United States staffed with English speaking technical support personnel.  All system documentation must be available in readily understandable English language format.

5.	Evaluation
After evaluation of the information received, the Coast Guard may issue a separate request for proposals.

Selection and contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer provides the best value to the Government determined by a balanced, performance based evaluation of system capabilities, acceptance of the government defined comprehensive support requirements, past performance, delivery and price.

The planned system evaluation criteria are: Technical Capability, Past Performance, Risk, Experience, Delivery and Price.  Proposals that exceed the basic requirements will be considered.

The evaluation and source selection process will consider each offeror's capability to provide a technical solution that best aligns with the requirements, is within the proposed schedule, and is affordably priced.  An integrated assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each offeror's proposal, together with the cost proposed, will be used to determine which proposal offers the best overall value to the Government.

<SUBJECT>--USMC THREE-SEASON SLEEPING BAG SYSTEM
<DESC>20 February 2007 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick, MA on behalf of the United States Marine Corps (U.S.M.C.) is seeking information regarding the availability of fabric that satisfies the Governments requirements as described below and in the attached documents .  This notice is constitutes a Request for Information only, THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, no award will be made for this effort at this time. REQUIREMENTS: US Marine Corps Program Manager-Infantry Combat Equipment (PM-ICE), Quantico, VA is contemplating adopting a three (3) season sleeping bag system to significantly reduce weight and volume while providing environmental protection for 20 deg Fahrenheit and a bove.  A three-season sleep system will be modular and consist of; sleeping mat, bivy cover, sleeping bag and simple compression stuff sack, where each component can be used singularly or in various combinations as missions environmental conditions dictat e. USMC is seeking to identify commercial or modified commercial products for one or more of the individual system components or complete system that will offer significant weight, volume, and protection improvements over the current items by 13 Apr 07. US MC prioritizes maximizing weight and volume reductions over increasing insulation beyond the minimum requirement, where applicable. A new 3 season sleep system, or selected components, will replace the current system components which consists of the Modula r Sleep System bivy cover, patrol bag, ISO mat and compression stuff sack.  The three-season sleep system objectives for the 4 integrated components follow: New System Weight:  6.0 lbs max required, 5.0 lbs desired.  The current system component weights in  pounds are; patrol bag @ 2.3, bivy @2.2, mat at 1.2, and compression stuff sack @ 0.8 lbs. New System Total Volume:  720 cu in required, 640 cu in desired.  Current system component volume for the patrol bag, bivy in stuff sack is 800 cu in and the ISO ma t is 780 cu in.  At a minimum, the system total volume can be spilt between 2 subsystems; sleeping bag, bivy and compression stuff sack, and the sleeping mat.  Note volumes are calculated from cylindrical dimensions. New System Insulation:  Manikin clo values of the sleep system requires  a minimum 5.3 clo, 6.0 clo desired, while wearing silkweight thermal underwear, fleece cap, socks and glove liners.  The current system component system provides a 4.3 clo with compon ent clo ESTIMATED at: 1.5 patrol bag @, 0.4 bivy @, 0.9 mat. The Government has not established correlation with KSU manikin yet expects a 1 clo increase over KSU results on the current patrol bag sleep system will meet this requirement. Wet Weather Protec tion:  The bivy cover will be waterproof with maximum breathability from the bivy top as a minimum.  The sleeping bag shell shall be water repellent with maximum breathability.  The mat and compression stuff sack will not absorb water when placed over stan ding puddled water, exposed to extended rain or stored when damp or wet. Durability: Components shall not degrade to extended periods of heavy military use and repeated stowage. The sleeping mat and bivy performance must not degrade from contact with the ground or when using item while wearing combat boots.  Items will not degr ade from repeated stuffing and compression when stowed wet or damp iteratively for several days to temperatures as low as 0 degree Fahrenheit.  Cleaning:  The sleeping bag and bivy must maintain performance up to 20 machine wash and dry launderings at warm  temperatures.  The compression stuff sack and mat must be able to be wiped clean and air dried, where machine washing of stuff sack is desired. Size: Two (2) lengths of sleeping bags are permissible where a regular length is suitable for a maximum height of 6 and a long length 6 to 65. A single length bivy and sleeping mat is required.  The sleeping bag must have sufficient ease to accommodate Marines to wear multiple l ayers of clothing to increase insulation for 0 degree Fahrenheit use. For reference, the current patrol bag provides acceptable ease for Large to XLarge marines wearing multiple clothing layers.  A cylindrical packed shape provides versatility in placement  in the ruck sack, particularly if the length is no longer than 20 inches.  Egress: Component closures must enable immediate and reliable opening for quick egress with no chance of trapping the Marine in the sleeping bag or bivy. EVALUATION TIME LINE: USMC  will evaluate product offerings and down select the items that prove significant improvement over the current items. The downselect items will be included in a field user evaluation (FUE) to determine operational effectiveness.  USMC plans to buy approxim ately 100 of each candidate in Jun 07 for September delivery to enable a 1 Oct to 20 Nov 2007 field user evaluation.  The FUE results will be utilized to select the best product for each system component based on what is most highly rated by Marines combin ed and good laboratory results.   USMC will pursue any improvements required to optimize the final candidates and procure the improved items during Dec 07 thru Feb 08 for a spring validation test in Mar to Apr 08.  If the validation results support adoptin g a 3 season sleep system, USMC would proceed with a solicitation for initial fielding of 200,000 systems or components over 1 to3 years based upon salient characteristics of the successful items and availability of funding.  USMCs PM-ICE will share findi ngs from each phase with Army PM-Clothing and Individual Equipment for their awareness and consideration. SUBMISSION: Interested suppliers are invited to submit a sample of their product offerings until 13 Apr 07.  Submitted items must include a representa tive sample, technical data quantifying its actual performance against USMC objectives, and estimated unit pricing based upon volume and USA manufacturing.  Any item ultimately procured for fielding must be Buy American and Berry compliant.  Natick Solider  Research, Development and Engineering Center is supporting the development of the 3 season sleep system for PM-ICE, MARCORSYSCOM, Quantico, VA.

<DESC>The Agency of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), through the General Acquisitions Branch (GAB), Program Support Center (PSC) requires a contractor to provide the following:

Description: National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month (Recovery Month) 2007
Community-Based Events
Background:
National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month (Recovery Month), now in its 18th year,
highlights the societal benefits of substance use disorder treatment, lauds the contributions of treatment providers, and promotes the message that recovery from substance use disorders in all its forms is possible. The September observance also encourages citizens to take action to help expand and improve the availability of effective treatment for those in need. The month-long celebration educates policymakers, Federal, state and local government entities, employers and business leaders, healthcare professionals, insurance provides, and the general public about substance abuse as a national public health problem affecting millions of people and the crucial role treatment plays in reclaiming lives ravaged by substance use disorders. All activities and products produced and distributed in connection with the celebration advertise and promote the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) as leaders in the Federal effort to expand the availability of effective substance use disorder treatment and  recovery services to all Americans.
According to SAMHSA's 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) current illicit drug use among youth ages 12-17 continues to decline. The rate has been moving downward from 11.6 percent using drugs in the past month in 2002 to 11.2 percent in 2003, 10.6 percent in 2004 and 9.9 percent in 2005. Similarly, the rate of current marijuana use among youth ages 12 to 17 declined significantly from 8.2 percent in 2002 to 6.8 percent in 2005, and the average age of first use of marijuana increased from under age 17 in 2003 to 17.4 years in 2005. Furthermore, drinking among teens declined, with 16.5 percent of youth ages 12-17 reporting current alcohol use and 9.9 percent reporting binge drinking. This compares with 17.6 percent of this age group reporting drinking in 2004 and 11.1 percent reporting binge drinking in the past month in 2004. These declines in alcohol use by youth, ages 12-17, follow years of relatively unchanged rates. The baby boomer generation presents a different story. Among adults aged 50 to 59, the rate of current illicit drug use increased from 2.7 percent to 4.4 percent between 2002 and 2005, reflecting the aging into this age group - the baby boom cohort. For young adults, ages 18-25, the picture is mixed. While there were no significant changes in overall past month use of any illicit drugs in this age group between 2002 and 2005, cocaine use increased from 2.0 in 2002 to 2.6 percent in 2005. Past-month nonmedical use of prescription drugs among young adults increased from 5.4 percent in 2002 to 6.3 percent in 2005, due largely to an increase in the nonmedical use of narcotic pain relievers. The rate was 4.1 percent in 2002 and 4.7 percent in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Education and outreach efforts are needed to continue these declines in youth drinking and current drug use as well as to prevent others from needing addiction treatment services in the future. Continued and expanded outreach is necessary to reach the baby boomers that have increased current illicit drug use as well as the young adults who have an increase in nonmedical use of narcotic pain relievers. It is essential to reach these individuals, their families and friends, employers and co-workers to help educate everyone about what is a substance use disorder. In addition, for those who still have a substance use problem, SAMHSA needs to provide education on the availability and effectiveness of alcohol and drug addiction treatment and that recovery is possible. Recovery Month creates an opportunity for SAMHSA/CSAT to join alliances with government agencies at all levels, the business community, health professionals, recovery community and professional organizations and affiliates within the treatment field, in order to help further its mission and program goals and to spread the word about substance use disorders and the benefits of treatment to those in need.
Goals and Reasons:
The proposed fifteen (15) SAMHSA-sponsored 2007 statewide community-based events will be an integral part of SAMHSA/CSAT?s 18th annual National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month.
The 2007 theme, Join the Voices for Recovery: Saving Lives, Saving Dollars, aims to highlight both the financial and human costs of addiction and mental health, and how treatment helps
individuals reclaim their lives. Human costs include but are not limited to self-esteem, ability to sustain meaningful relationships, value in family, value in community, etc. In addition, the observance will work to increase awareness of the cost of substance use disorders and mental illness as it relates to other chronic illnesses, show the drain on the health care system for untreated addiction and the effects/relationship to other medical conditions, and highlight the positive effects of early screening, intervention, and referrals. 

As with all of the Recovery Month efforts, the proposed fifteen (15) statewide community events will advertise and promote SAMHSA/CSAT as leaders in the Federal effort to expand the availability of effective substance abuse treatment and recovery services available to Americans. This goal is consistent with SAMHSA?s matrix goals and program priorities of Substance Abuse Treatment Capacity; Co-occurring Disorders; Children and Families; the New Freedom Initiative, and Criminal Justice. In addition, the Recovery Month effort also meets the SAMHSA
crosscutting principles of Collaboration with Public and Private Partners; Recovery/Reducing Stigma and Barriers to Service; Cultural Competency/Eliminating Disparities; Community and
Faith-based Approaches and Workforce Development. The community events support the overall DHHS/SAMHSA/ CSAT and Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) goal of demand reduction and other Administration treatment initiatives.

As with all SAMHSA/CSAT activities and events, special consideration and emphasis are required in the coordination of the community-based events to promote the interests of special
emphasis groups and minorities. These groups include African American, Asian Pacific Islander, Hispanic, American Indians/Alaskan Natives, older Americans, adolescents and youth, and the disabled community.
The Recovery Month fifteen (15) statewide community-based events play a significant role in the month-long observance for local community agencies, civic organizations, elected officials,
business leaders, agencies and providers and addiction providers, people in recovery and others come together to plan and execute events and activities to promote community action in support for and improvement of addiction treatment. In years past, communities have come together to advocate for specific improvements and additional slots for addiction treatment efforts. In doing so, the community-based events participants become both architects and activists for community change. This focus on state and local treatment needs is the principle goal of the Recovery Month community-based events and activities. 
Statewide, Community-Based Event options:
Community-based events will be organized in many different formats. For ideas and suggestions of past events, visit the official Recovery Month Website at www.recoverymonth.gov and look at the past events held in 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 observances.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

?Expanded Affiliated Group? means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

?Foreign Incorporated Entity? means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

?Inverted Domestic Corporation.? A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held? 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
?Person?, ?domestic?, and ?foreign? have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

All interested offerors are hereby made aware that in order to be considered, they must submit a technical and price proposal that covers all aspects of the SOW, not selected parts of the SOW.  However, TSA is willing to consider the merit of any proposed subcontracting or teaming arrangements meeting the Limitations in Subcontracting requirements.

****************************************************************


AMENDMENT 09 TO RFP HSTS03-07-R-ACQ913:  The purpose of this amendment is to extend the due date for proposals, to add a condition to the RFP and to provide clarifications to earlier responses.

A)  The due date for proposals is extended to Wednesday, February 28, 2007 at 2:00 PM EST.  

B)  The following condition regarding subcontracts is added to the RFP under Section XV. Special Notes:

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer reasonably in advance of placing any subcontract or modification.  Consent is always required for such change and shall include the following information: 
(1) A description of the supplies or services to be subcontracted. 
(2) Identification of the type of subcontract to be used. 
(3) Identification of the proposed subcontractor. 
(4) The proposed subcontract price. 
(5) The subcontractor?s current, complete, and accurate cost or pricing data and Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, if required by other contract provisions.

C)  This amendment provides clarifications to two questions and responses publicized under Amendment 08 (posted February 16, 2007).  Hereafter, no additional questions or clarification requests will be addressed by TSA.

***Amendment 08, Question 4: On RFP page 5 of 24, Section IV, reference is made to "12-pitch" type font.  I am assuming that should read 12-point font.  Is that correct?  Also, does the 12-point font restriction apply to all text within a graphic?

Amendment 08, Answer 4: No, the font requirement does not apply to all text within a graphic.

Clarification:  The above answer is corrected to say the font requirement applies to all text, tables and graphics, including text within a graphic.

*** Amendment 08, Question 5: Are you only requiring pricing from the prime?

Amendment 08, Answer 5:  No, pricing from the prime and subcontractors, if any, is required for any work that may ever be ordered under the BPA(s).

Clarification:  Offerors may choose to propose the Pricing Schedule using blended labor rates, individual prime and subcontractor rates or any other method they choose.  However, offerors must provide price or other data to substantiate their proposed rates, including evidence supporting burdens such as G&A.  Additionally, in the case of a team arrangement, the Pricing Schedule must demonstrate the offeror is in compliance with the Limitations in Subcontracting clause (i.e. 51% of the cost of the work will be performed by the prime small business contractor).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address additional questions from potential Offerors, establish a cutoff date for submission of any additional questions and allow for additional time for the submission of offers. The following Amendment 03 questi ons and answers are provided.  QUESTION 1:  Do they really want dimmers on Fluorescent lights? It really should be Incandescent in a shield room. Are they 4 bulb 40w? ANSWER 1: Yes, dimmers are required on the 4 bulb 40W fluorescent lights. QUESTION 2: Wha t is 3.5 & 4 Fiber Optic Type ST fitting? We use WGF-4 or 6 from Fiber Plex is this acceptable? ANSWER 2: The WGF-4 from Fiber Plex would be acceptable. QUESTION 3: The 1 inch conduit shown with a 3 foot Radius, does it come thru the shield floor? This cou ld be a difficult connection at the floor if it does. For one thing it is not at 90deg. to the concrete. Oblong hole required. Please advise. ANSWER 3:  The 1 inch conduits will need to come through the shield floor.  The conduit is 90 Degrees to the floor  at a height of approximately 8 inches.  The construction contractor for the EMVAF did not install the conduits per the original plan.  Updated drawings and pictures are available upon request from martha.robles@arl.army.mil. The position would be the same  as the previous drawing. The transformer pad can be seen in the pictures.  Please note that the conduit currently extends 18 inches above the concrete floor.  These can be cut down somewhat, but they will likely penetrate through the computer floor of the  enclosure as well.  QUESTION 4:  Regarding the gas fire suppression system installation, will installation of the gas fire suppression system require any approvals and/or permit by public fire department?  Can we assume no special permits are required?  W ill any department on base require any approval or permits? ANSWER 4:  The EMVAF has a 1 year warranty on the fire alarm panel that must be maintained. The integration of the fire alarm into the fire alarm panel must be done by subcontract to EMI, POC: Joe  Lepeska (505)883-8955. EMI will need to coordinate with the fire department when they integrate it into the EMVAF fire alarm system. The fire department POC is Chief Davis, 505-678-3585.   Any additional questions must be submitted in writing to the Contr act Specialist at martha.robles@arl.army.mil by 3:00 P.M. MST, 26 February 2007, after which no more questions will be entertained.  The synopsis/solicitation response date is extended through 08 March 2007.
