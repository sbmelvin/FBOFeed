<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Immune Activation Section (IAS) of the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology (LMI) intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competition basis with Becton, Dickinson and Company, 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, California 95131 to procure a BD FACSCelesta BVR Flow Cytometer #660344 to include the following items: #658946 - BD FACSCelesta HTS, #660472 - Elite800 Workstation Bundle FACSCelesta, #652792 - NEC 23 Inch LED, #655050 - 2 each of the BD FACSDiva CS&amp;T Research Beads Kit, #334224 - FACS Shutdown Solution, #336524 - BD FACS Sheath Solution w/Surfactant, #661307 - Svc Con FACSCelesta BVR 1 Year, and #649908 - Option FACSFlow Supply Sys LSRFortessa. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13.501(a)(1).
<p><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type of contract.</p>
<p>Delivery to Bethesda, Maryland 20892 approximately 45 days after receipt of award.</p>
<p>The BD FACSCelesta flow cytometer will allow the investigators of IAS to use combinations of fluorescent antibodies with colors that allow for the accurate and unique identification in most cell types at relevant tissue sites, along with the expression of critical cytokines by these cells. The combinations of fluorescent antibodies and appropriate colors have largely been worked by the IAS with BD's flow cytometers using similar configurations as the BD FACSCelesta. The lab will no longer have ready access to these existing flow cytometers. The IAS has an urgent need to acquire their own flow cytometer that will serve their daily usage, and will allow the lab to continue to use protocols that have been established over many years of experimenting. This will also allow the comparison of data obtained previously with future data to be obtained. In addition, the BD FACSCelesta operated with the BD Diva software, which the lab has been using in many of their past and current projects. This particular flow cytometer footprint will be accommodatable to the space limitation in the lab. The use of another model flow cytometry system the lab will not be able to use any past protocol data, therefore limiting their experimental processes.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.

All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if it can meet the above equipment described herein. All responses received by the closing date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p><br />The Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program is considering a purchase of a AFPSL - Upgrade Molbox1-AFPSL. Upgrade the current Low Gas Flow Standard DH Instruments (P/N Molbox1-AFPSL), to the new Molbox1+ AFPSL which will improve the accuracy to &plusmn; 0.125% of reading flow measurement uncertainty. It also improves high flow rangeablility. The molbox performs the data acquisition and processing functions necessary to precisely determine the flow of different types of gases through a connected molbloc flow element.

<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grant Services intends to award a sole source, firm fixed-price contract to FoodTrack, Inc. for a subscription to FoodTrack Alert Bulletins. The FDA's Office of Emergency Operations (OEO) provides interagency coordination and response to adverse events, foodborne illnesses, injuries, product tampering and man-made and natural disasters and assists in the development of emergency operations plans and incident specific annexes and the design, implementation, and presentation of associated training and exercise programs. The OEO also represents the Agency at federal, state, local and foreign government meetings and workgroups on emergency preparedness and response by providing nationwide, 24-hour, seven-day-a-week emergency response system and managing the National Consumer Complaint System. Therefore, the purpose of this requirement is to obtain a subscription to FoodTrack Alert Bulletins.
<p>FoodTrackAlert<sup>TM</sup> Bulletins alert subscribers to adverse, or potentially adverse, safety and security events that directly impact the worldwide food industry. FoodTrack is the gold standard for manned, round-the-clock, mission-critical reporting regarding food borne illness outbreaks, product recalls,and bio-terrorist threats. Only FoodTrack individually screens hundreds of independent news sources, which are then filtered through proprietary systems, to yield relevant real-time data 24 hours a day/7 days a week. FoodTrack advisories reach the world's largest food companies, their supply chains, retailers, governmental bodies, and leading trade organizations such as FMI, FPA, and PMA. As the publisher of the FoodTrack Alerts, only FoodTrack, Inc. is capable of providing the required subscription services.</p>
<p>The proposed simplified acquisition action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested parties may identify their interests and capabilities to respond to the requirement prior to the response date of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. No further solicitation is available.</p>
<p>FDA will consider all responses received prior to the closing date of this notice and will use responses in determining whether it is necessary to use full and open competition for this requirement. Reponses shall be emailed to Robin Goon at Robin.Goon@fda.hhs.gov no later than 12:00pm EST on July 7, 2017.</p>

DRAFT

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

1.1 Purpose
Censitrac is a Dental and Medical-Surgical instrument and reusable medical equipment (RME) tracking solution developed by Censis Technologies, Inc. (Censis). Censitrac has been installed in multiple Veteran Integrated System Network (VISN) VA Medical Centers (VAMCs). All instruments require a 2-dimensional data matrix that uniquely identifies the instrument. The marking or stencil is applied by a marking station supplied by Censis and then details about the instrument are entered into the Censitrac database. As the instrument travels through the sterilization process, the electrochemical mark is scanned such that the instrument can be tracked through the process. Some instruments cannot be marked based on chemical, surface, electromagnetic, or material characteristics of which the instruments are made and these instruments are instead supplementary marked with a  dot  or  tape  which contains a pre-printed 2D matrix barcode on a small surface with a semi-permanent adhesive backing. These supplementary dots/tapes withstand repeat sterilizations without adverse effect.
VISN 16 desires to initiate/complete the implementation of their Censis System with completion of marking and commissioning services for their instrument inventory.  This requirement is for the scope of services required for VISN 16 and its facilities to finalize all marking and commissioning of dental and medical-surgical instruments utilizing VA developed data standards and guidance.

1.2 Scope of Work - Marking & Commissioning (M&C) Services
Tracking enhances the ability of VA to mitigate human factor concerns while ensuring world-class patient care and staff safety by providing assurances that instruments have been fully processed in accordance with regulatory guidelines and individual instrument manufacturer s Instructions for Use (IFU) for reusable medical equipment (RME) and dental/medical-surgical instrumentation.
The VA desires that the Marking & Commissioning (M&C) service offering enhance Sterile Processing Service (SPS) business processes and support SPS staff responsible for tracking, cleaning and distributing reusable medical equipment throughout the medical facility by automating the traceability of tasks, instruments, and supplies.   The following table contains SPS-specific requirements:
Req. ID
Requirement
MC001
The contractor shall review, provide constructive feedback, approve, and pre-populate the system with the site s medical/surgical and dental instrument data, providing access to the Censis Master Library as necessary for the effort.
MC002
The contractor shall ensure proper placement and application of 2D matrix mark by either electrochemical or manual (e.g. 2D matrix dot/tape) processes. Placement shall not impede clinician s use, nor subject any risk to the Veteran patient.
MC003
The contractor shall ensure QA of applied mark ensures that the matrix is scannable by the Censitrac system within a maximum of three (3) seconds.
MC004
Enter data into Censitrac dataset in strict accordance with the RTLS Sterile Processing Workflow (SPW) data standards (specifically DS018, DS019, and DS020); while qualifying as needed via the current version of VA RTLS Medical-Surgical and Dental Instrument Nomenclature Guidance.
MC005
The contractor shall create/provide tray count sheets utilizing 2D matrix scanning to readily identify instrument inventory of each set.
MC006
Commissioning QA: Vendor s PM/technical staff will analyze the data entries and apply VAs National Naming Convention/Data Standards and Data Quality Tool (DQT) to all of the records, ensuring 100% compliance with the standards PRIOR to submission to VA for review/acceptance. 
MC006.1
Data Quality Tool (DQT) new terms derived during the commissioning effort will be submitted to the VA COR/RTLS SPW Workgroup for processing and actions/approval within five (5) business days of cessation of M&C. 
MC006.2

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">With support from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Physics, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory&rsquo;s (LBNL) Nuclear Science Division is leading a multi-institutional project to build the most world&rsquo;s most advanced gamma-ray detector array for nuclear science experiments. GRETA, Gamma-Ray Energy Tracking Array, will be a powerful instrument needed to accomplish a broad range of experiments that will play an essential role in addressing the intellectual challenges of low-energy nuclear science.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">GRETA is the realization of a full 4&pi; &gamma;-ray tracking detector capable of reconstructing the energy and three-dimensional position of &gamma;-ray interactions within a compact sphere of high-purity germanium crystals. It is a follow on to the Gamma-Ray Energy Tracking In-beam Nuclear Array (GRETINA) project. Key requirements for GRETA include high full-energy efficiency, good background rejection, and excellent energy and position resolution. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The underlying concept for GRETA is based on the ability to track &gamma; rays in position-sensitive detectors. &nbsp;In order to enable effective &gamma;-ray tracking and suppress events that do not deposit their full energy in the array, it is necessary to localize individual interactions within the detector volumes with spatial resolution on the order of a few millimeters. This is accomplished by combining segmented detector technology with pulse-shape processing to localize interaction points with sub-segment resolution. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The GRETA design requires four coaxial hyper-pure germanium (HPGe) crystals packed in a single vacuum-tight cryostat with a liquid nitrogen Dewar. Each crystal has 37 electrical contacts, 1 central (full-volume) contact and 36 outer-segment contacts,</span><span style="font-size: 14.5pt; font-family: &quot;Times&quot;,serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">which connect to a high-bandwidth, low noise charge sensitive preamplifier through an input FET. The modules are closely packed to tile a sphere.</span></p>

General Equipment Name:  636-17-3-3998-0448
Description:  VA-Central Iowa Health Care System (VA-CIHCS) Safe Patient Handling and Mobility Program has a requirement for a shower trolley for the Community Living Center.  There is a need for (1) hydraulic shower trolley.  The previous shower trolley has been excessed and the need for this piece of equipment is still needed within the facility to provide best care to the Veterans served.

This shower trolley will not exceed the space dimensions for storage and movement to the shower rooms.  

One of the two shower trolleys that VACIHCS owned has already been excessed and the other is near end of life expectancy.  This trolley will be replacing the former.

Include 1, hydraulic shower trolley that has a capacity of at least 350 pounds

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.<br />Background: To establish and move stem cell technologies forward through a more centralized effort, NIH has launched the Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL) within NCATS. Part of the NIH Common Fund's the goal of the SCTL is to bring iPSC technology closer to clinical application, drug discovery and regenerative medicine. Through the SCTL, NCATS will provide researchers across various disciplines and organizations with the ability to establish collaborations to advance the translation of regenerative medicine applications. Through a multidisciplinary collaborative team approach, NCATS' SCTL scientists aim to:<br />&bull; Establish detailed quality control (QC) standards to define pluripotency and differentiated cell types.<br />&bull; Develop methods to assess variations in cultured cells derived from iPSCs.<br />&bull; Develop standard methods to produce mature cells meeting the QC standards above.<br />&bull; Discover, validate and disseminate small molecule reagents to replace expensive recombinant proteins, xenogenic material and undefined media components in cell differentiation protocols.<br /><br />Infrared imaging is a technique of capturing invisible infrared images and converting them into visible images. Normal human vision can see only visible light, which is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum; the electromagnetic spectrum is a scale classifying the different forms of electromagnetic radiation like gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible rays, infrared rays, microwaves and radio waves. To see in infrared light, infrared imagers and cameras are required. These have special sensors that do not need visible light to operate. <br /><br />This Infrared Imaging System will allows NCATS to continue the mission of the SCTL but utilizing the new generation of infrared imaging systems that provided new software that enhances the images and produces images at a faster speed. <br />Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this requirement is to procure an Infrared Imaging Unit for the Stem Cell Translation Laboratory.</p>

<p>5. Description:</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: TRND is requesting to purchase an IN Cell Analyzer 2500 HS system to replace their existing IN Cell Analyzer 2000.</p>
<p>This request will enable the NCATS/TRND group to increase the capability to optimize phenotypic screens involving lysosomal storage disorders, infectious diseases such as Zika virus, and immunofluorescence assays which are widely used for stem cell work.<br />A functioning IN Cell imager is paramount to the functionality of TRND group. The IN Cell system is to be used to handle the existing protocols of imaging assays previously established by this group. TRND's IN Cell 2000 is 7 years old, and has experienced frequent problems with the z motor, which is due to both instrument age and design issues experienced with the 2000 model. GE Healthcare, the manufacturers of the IN Cell, have acknowledged these issues, and have agreed to a trade-in of the IN Cell Analyzer 2000 for an IN Cell Analyzer 2500HS, resulting in a significant discount. In addition to resolving issues with functionality, the upgrade to a newer model will improve sensitivity, as the IN Cell 2500 switched from a xenon lamp to the more sensitive LED lamp.</p>
<p>TRND group relies heavily on the IN Cell system for phenyotypic screening projects, and it is imperative that the issues we have had with the malfunctioning 2000 be resolved.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this procurement is the acquisition of an INCell Analyzer 2500HS.</p>
<p>Purchase Description: <br />1) Brand name: IN Cell Analyzer 2500HS <br />2) Manufacturer's name: GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp<br />3) Model, type, catalog no: <br />IN Cell Analyzer 2500HS: 29248665<br />IN Cell 2500 and 6500 Liquid Handling: 29248665<br />IN Cell Analyzer live cell plus module: 29251074<br />IN Carta image analysis v1.x 1 seat promo: 29178556</p>

2.0 Background:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) Information Technology Operations and Services (ITOPS), Infrastructure Operations (IO) operates and maintains a complex and fast paced Information Technology (IT) environment in a number of Government and commercial data centers.  IO requires the ability to rapidly respond to the dynamically changing IT requirements of its customers which include OI&T, Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and Other Government Agencies (OGA).

In FY12, IO delivered a private cloud deployment as part of its fee-for-service franchise fund service catalog.  Based on commodity hardware and VMware software to create virtual server environments, the offering aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) service model. This IO private cloud IaaS currently supports 2,000 Virtual Machines (VM) on 1PB of storage, 195kGHz CPU, and 48TB Random Access Memory (RAM) using VMWare and Microsoft hypervisor technology.  IO hosts this IaaS at VA s Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) and Philadelphia Information Technology Center (PITC).

In order to meet the growing needs of its customers and efficiently and effectively utilize its IT resources (network infrastructure, servers, etc.), IO intends to implement an enterprise-class, geographically diverse, Hybrid Cloud solution that offers essential cloud characteristics such as on-demand self-service, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.  Some of the Hybrid Cloud service models to be integrated include Infrastructure as-a Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) service models.  This Hybrid Cloud infrastructure will permit VA customers to self-provision resources, etc. VA IT administrators will be able to monitor customer utilization, analyze trends, and effectively plan IT resource expansion.  The Hybrid Cloud may be deployed to more than one geographically dispersed VA Information Technology Center.  The Hybrid Cloud will also have the ability to connect VA s current IO Cloud and to multiple VA-approved Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) including other government agencies and commercial entities such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or other FISMA high or moderate environments.

To achieve this objective, VA may require the following onsite capabilities:
Cloud Management Platform (CMP) 
Converged/Hyper-converged Cloud Infrastructure 
Managed Services for a Cloud Infrastructure

VA is considering a variety of implementation options to include but not limited to the following possible approaches to acquiring and managing these new functionalities.  VA will also consider alternate implementation approaches.

CMP On-Premise Software Only 
Vendor shall provide, install, and test the CMP and provide all licenses and documentation.  
Cloud infrastructure hardware and hardware installation will be provided VA.
VA service lines will manage the system.

Converged/Hyper-converged Infrastructure Only
Vendor shall provide, install, and test the Converged/Hyper-converged Infrastructure and provide all licenses and documentation.
VA will supply the CMP solution.
VA service lines will manage the system.

Converged/Hyper-converged Infrastructure and CMP:
Vendor shall provide, install, and test the CMP and Converged/Hyper-converged Infrastructure and provide all licenses and documentation.  The vendor shall also provide integration with existing infrastructure. 
VA service lines will manage the system. 

Converged/Hyper-converged Infrastructure, CMP, and Managed Services for a Cloud Infrastructure:
Vendor shall provide, install, and test the CMP and Converged/Hyper-converged Infrastructure and provide all licenses and documentation.  The vendor shall also provide integration with existing infrastructure.
The vendor shall provide managed services to include operations, maintenance, support services, and full lifecycle management of the solution. 

3.0 Technical Requirements: 
The detailed technical requirements for the CMP, Converged/Hyper-converged Infrastructure, and associated Managed Services capabilities are listed below.  VA expects the vendors to provide configuration/implementation services, training, and help desk services to support each of these three capabilities.

3.1 CMP:
The CMP solution shall provide the capability to dynamically monitor system usage and incorporate processes that allow for the full resiliency of a cloud solution.  The solution shall be scalable on an enterprise level to multiple geographically diverse data centers, and may consist of one or more tools/components.  Gartner defines Cloud Management Platforms as    integrated products that provide for the management of public, private and hybrid cloud environments.  The minimum requirements to be included in this category are products that incorporate self-service interfaces, provision system images, enable metering and billing, and provide for some degree of workload optimization through established policies.  More-advanced offerings may also integrate with external enterprise management systems, include service catalogs, support the configuration of storage and network resources, allow for enhanced resource management via service governors and provide advanced monitoring for improved  guest  performance and availability.   

Specifically, VA anticipates that the CMP solution will include many or all of the following key capabilities:

On-demand self-service.

<DESC>The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Wildlife Service's State Office&nbsp;in Lakewood, CO intends to purchase five FLIR Recon M18 InfraRed Thermal Imaging Scopes from FLIR Surveillance, Inc. of North Billerica, NJ.&nbsp; The night scopes will be used for an ongoing&nbsp;project with the&nbsp;Colorado Department of Transportation Aeronautics Division (CDOT) to conduct biological surveys at 14 facilities across the state to document wildlife hazards at airfields.&nbsp; High quality, military-grade,&nbsp;thermal optics are necessary to assess nocturnal wildlife species identification and activity on the airfields/heliports and the surrounding landscape.<br /><br />FLIR is the only company that manufacturers and offers discounted demonstration models of military grade thermal monoculars with the features and specifications that meet our field work needs. The following combination of salient characteristics make the FLIR Recon M18 unique as the only item that will meet our needs:<br />1. Lightweight and portable<br />2. Integrated laser pointer for use with Night Vision equipment<br />3. Ability to simultaneously look through the viewfinder of the monocular, and a video output source<br />4. Ability to attach other extender lens to increase magnification<br />5. 640x480 Resolution<br />6. Min 2x optical zoom and 4x digital zoom<br />7. Minimum 3 hour battery life under 640x480 resolution<br />8. Must meet MIL-SPEC 810F environmental requirements
<p>As a MIL-SPEC item, the distribution of these units is highly regulated. There are only a small handful of authorized distributors for these products. Two distributors and the manufacturer were solicited for quotes. The distributors were unable to offer competitive pricing as the manufacturer could offer demonstration units at a substantial discount.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this intended purchase order based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Simplified procurement procedures per FAR 13 will be used as well as commercial item acquisition regulations per FAR 12. Any inquiries regarding this acquisition must be submitted by email to michael.j.chiodi@aphis.usda.gov by Monday, July 10, 2017, 12:30pm eastern time for consideration.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Science-Metrix Corporation, 2331 Mill Road Suite 100, Alexandria, VA 22314 to produce Federally mandated reports on technology transfer; one at the Department of Commerce level, and one at the Federal level. Within these reports, data is provided regarding the number of patents, publications, and citations per agency, per scientific field.  and to maintain data consistency, NIST must contract the collection of the data with the same contractor that NSF used previously.
<p>The sole source justification is based on the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the past three years, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has freely provided the necessary data to NIST. When NIST received the FY 2015 data, NIST was informed that FY 2015 was the last year that NSF could provide the data.</p>
<p>In previous years, the National Science Foundation (NSF) provided the necessary data for the Federal and Commerce Technology Transfer reports through Science-Metrix. When NSF provided NIST with FY 2015 data last year, NSF stated that future data would need to be acquired directly by NIST.</p>
<p>In order to remain consistent with the data provided in previous reports, and because the NIST Information Services Office was unable to duplicate the FY 2015 data with its own data extraction methods, using Science-Metrix will allow for consistency and accuracy when providing the necessary metrics within the statutorily-required reports.<br /> <br />The NAICS Code is 519190 with a size standard of $27.5M.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by 1:00 pm ET July 13, 2017, will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Correlated Technologies, Inc, 121 Dutchman Blvd., Irmo, SC, 29063-8330 to provide a High Resolution Stereoscopic Camera System and associated hardware, computer and data.
<p>The sole source justification is based on the following: The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST's) Materials Performance Group (MPG) requires the procurement of a highly customized, high resolution stereoscopic (two camera) camera system to be used with existing NIST digital image correlation (DIC) software licenses to measure critical mechanical property data on additively manufactured materials as part of a focused research effort on additive manufacturing.  DIC is a technique that enables high-resolution measurements of the displacements that occur during mechanical testing in three-dimensions.  A system of this type usually consists of two video cameras with high pixel density, appropriate lenses, and a controller for data acquisition.  The acquired data are then post-processed to determine the relative dimensional changes that occurred during the experiment.  Post processing is performed using proprietary DIC software, licenses for which NIST has acquired in the past under a different requirement (REQ#NB185000-7-04067) but that is fully compatible for the present need and thus presents a cost savings to the government by avoiding purchasing new software licenses to go along with the new camera and data acquisition hardware outlined in this requirement that are specific to the new measurement needs of the MPG involving additive manufacturing.</p>
<p>This procurement shall supply two identical high-resolution video cameras, to matching lenses, a computer for image and data acquisition, and other hardware necessary to maintain complete compatibility with existing licenses of the data acquisition and analysis software from Correlated Solutions, Inc (VIC-Snap and VIC-3D, respectively).  Compatibility will be verified by pre-testing the operation of both software packages.  The MPG currently owns an unused license for VIC-Snap is that has been assigned to a system with NIST Property # 641641.  The dongle for this license will be transferred to the new system.<br /><br />The NAICS Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by 1:00 pm ET July 13, 2017, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>The sole source determination is based on the IT Management Office's requirement DNN CMS Software. This software is currently used to support the public facing websites and intranet for OAR. This requirement is for the renewal of current licenses, as well as new licenses that are required for separation of external and internal facing websites. The software is the website framework that runs on a web server and maintains these websites.

Teleradiology Focused Management Review Services

The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC), on behalf of the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC), 3001 N. Green Bay Road, North Chicago, Illinois 60064 (hereinafter called VA), intends to issue a sole source nine-month contract to Valor Network Inc., 7 Hemptor Road, New City, New York 10956 (hereinafter called Valor) pursuant to VETERANS FIRST procurement IAW 38 USC 8127, Public Law 109-461 section 502 and VAAR 819.7007; and to 38 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

The VA has an immediate need to contract with a teleradiology company to perform an in-depth focused management review of various films.  The VA is experiencing an unexpected decrease in workforce of Radiologists which prevents it from conducting an internal review of 3,353 MRI exams, 100 CT exams, and 100 x ray exams as a baseline review.  Depending upon the results of the review, an additional 5,476 exams might need to be reviewed to confirm that the standard of care is met.  To delay the peer review could impact a patient s clinical care and possible outcome.  

Valor provides teleradiology services at the FHCC and would be able to immediately begin reviewing films after contract award.  Valor is the only contractor that has the resources (manpower, experience, technical/operational knowledge and an established Virtual Private Network [VPN] interconnection of the two computer systems, VA VISTA and DOD CHCS) to perform the critical mission for the short-term contract. 
 
VPN access is approved through VA Central Office and takes approximately 6 weeks to 40 weeks.  Valor has an approved national Interconnection Security Agreement/Memorandum of Agreement (ISA/MOA).  The FHCC requires its contract employees to complete and receive a favorable ANACI background investigation before commencing work on the contract.  Valor s board certified Radiologist have received favorable ANACI background investigations.  This process would require a lead time of 3-4 months for a new contractor.  Radiologist are also required to be credentialed and privileged to perform these duties.  This process could take up to 4 months.  Valor is the only teleradiology company that has an approved VPN connection, radiologists who are credentialed and privileged enabling them access to patient records, and the favorably adjudicated ANACI background investigations for the radiologists.  

Proceeding with an award to any vendor other than Valor Teleradiology Inc. would cause unacceptable delays in determining and identifying whether there are any cases where there is a significant miss in the Radiology report that would impact a patient s clinical case and possible outcome.  The consequences would be detrimental to providing timely patient care.

Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes experience, certifications, and approved ISA/MOA.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.

Responses to this announcement must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than 1:00PM Central Time, May 30, 2017 to the following email address: Patrice.Bond@va.gov.  No other form of communication will be accepted.

Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe or "Native" as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203; 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Indian Economic Enterprise means any business activity owned by one or more Indians or Indian Tribes that is established for the purpose of profit, provided that:

The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods:

(2) At the time of contract award; and,
(3) During the full term of the contract.
Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.

(f) Eligibility.
(1) Participation in the Mentor-Protege Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an Indian economic enterprise ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.

The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility. Failure to give the CO immediate written notification means that: (i) The economic enterprise may be declared ineligible for future contract awards under this part; and (ii) Indian Affairs may consider termination for default if it is in the best interest of the government.
This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(END OF CLAUSE)</p>
<p><br />NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.<br />(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 5 P.M. MST on July 14, 2017. All quotes must be emailed or faxed to the attention of Ryan Stroud. The email address is ryan.stroud@noaa.gov, and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>

<DESC><br />******PREVIOUS SOLICITATION NUMBER W91236-17-R-0022*****<br /><br /><br />1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
<p>The work consists of raising the soil dikes surrounding and crossing the Craney Island Dredged Material Management Area (CIDMMA) a few feet at a time. This work shall be performed by earth moving, hauling and placement equipment with all work contained within the CIDMMA boundaries. Dredge materials stored in the two borrow sites shall be excavated and then transported to dike raising locations as specified in contract plans and then placed and compacted. The Contractor is responsible for the completion of both the Before Dike (BD) and After Dike (AD) surveys and associated documentation for planning, progress billings, and final as-built drawings. If all anticipated funding is awarded, approximately 1,023,000 cubic yards of dredge material shall be transported and placed onto the dikes. The dike raising includes two to four feet of compacted fill placed across all dikes' top surfaces and partially down each of the dike's side slopes. The contract includes grubbing and clearing before dike material placement; and hydroseeding after dike placement. This is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract where the specific work areas and scope shall be defined using Task Orders based on unit costs included in the Contractor's cost proposal.</p>
<p>The IDIQ contract will include a one year Base Contract with two Option Years.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall comply with the provisions of EM 385-1-1. If the Contractor is a currently accepted participant in the Dredging Contractors of America (DCA)/United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Dredging Safety Management Program (DSMP), as determined by the DCA/USACE Joint Committee, and holds a current valid Certificate of Compliance for both the Contractor Program and the Dredge(s) to be used to perform the work under this contract, the Contractor may, in lieu of the submission of an Accident Prevention Plan (APP),</p>
<p>(1) make available for review, upon request, the Contractor's current Safety Management System (SMS) documentation,</p>
<p>(2) submit to the Contracting Officer the current valid Company Certificate of Compliance for its SMS,</p>
<p>(3) Submit the current dredge(s) Certificate of Compliance based on third party audit, and submit for review and acceptance, site-specific addenda to the SMS as specified in the solicitation.</p>

The Contractor shall perform the scheduled dike earthwork construction and all other associated work in accordance with all requirements as indicated and as specified herein. The Contractor is advised that any deviations from the construction methods and procedures indicated and as specified herein that are not prior-approved in writing by the Contracting Officer shall be cause for the Contracting Officer issuing a stop work order. Any stop work orders issued for such cause will not be subject to time extensions or cost recovery by the Contractor. Any non-compliance with or violation of the laws or regulations governing the work operations for the project may result in criminal and civil penalties against the Contractor.</p>
<p>a. Security and Public Safety of Work Areas<br />Access to this Government site is limited and must be approved by USACE.

The Contractor shall be solely responsible for the protection of their workers and other contractors and USACE personnel at the site at all times for the duration of the contract and fully comply with the provisions of OSHA safe working practices and the Safety and Accident Prevention requirements of these specifications.</p>
<p>b. Protection of Government Property<br />The contractor shall keep their premises, work areas, and transit roads in good order and in a clean, safe condition by and at their expense. The contractor shall be responsible for any damage that may be caused by the contractor's activities and shall exercise due diligence in the protection of all property located at the site against fire or damage from any or all other causes. Contractor damages shall be promptly repaired or replaced at their expense to a condition satisfactory to USACE.</p>
<p>c. Coordination with Other Contractors<br />During the period of this contract, other contracts and USACE personnel may be in force for the construction of other features of work on or adjacent to the site of work being accomplished under this contract and for usage of the dike haul roads. The Contractor shall arrange his plant, and shall schedule and perform this work, so as to effectively cooperate with all other contractors and Government agencies. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor on this contract to be fully informed of the extent of the limits of work to be performed by other contractors and USACE workers. Should there be any conflict between these limits, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer of the conflict, and the Contracting Officer's decision shall be final.</p>
<p><br />3. CONSTRUCTION TIME</p>
<p>For each of the three years included in the IDIQ contract, multiple Task Orders that include the base contract bid items shall be issued to cover varying volumes of dike material placement subject to available funds. The Task Orders will be issued sequentially and work is expected to run almost continuously over the entire three year period, if funding permits.

Where an apparent low bidder, in performance of contracts during the previous three-year period, incurred one or more accidents, or where, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, there is any question regarding this compliance with any safety or accident prevention requirement, such bidder, on request of the Contracting Officer prior to any award under this solicitation, shall attend a conference with representatives of the Contracting Officer to discuss any such accidents or non-compliance, the reason for their occurrence, and measures which will be taken to preclude any recurrence thereof.</p>

The<br />Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>

For items that are serialized within the part, lot, or batch number within the enterprise identifier, the unique item identifier shall include the data elements of the enterprise identifier; the original part, lot, or batch number; and the serial number.</p>
<p>Enterprise means the entity (e.g., a manufacturer or vendor) responsible for assigning unique item identifiers to items.</p>
<p>Enterprise identifier means a code that is uniquely assigned to an enterprise by an issuing agency. Government's unit acquisition cost means--<br />(1) For fixed-price type line, subline, or exhibit line items, the unit price identified in the contract at the time of delivery;<br /><br />(2) For cost-type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items, the Contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost to the Government at the time of delivery; and</p>
<p>(3) For items produced under a time-and-materials contract, the Contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost to the Government at the time of delivery.</p>
<p>Issuing agency means an organization responsible for assigning a globally unique identifier to an enterprise, as indicated in the Register of Issuing Agency Codes for ISO/IEC 15459, located at http://www.aimglobal.org/?Reg_Authority15459.</p>
<p>Issuing agency code means a code that designates the registration (or controlling) authority for the enterprise identifier.</p>
<p>Item means a single hardware article or a single unit formed by a grouping of subassemblies, components, or constituent parts.</p>
<p>Lot or batch number means an identifying number assigned by the enterprise to a designated group of items, usually referred to as either a lot or a batch, all of which were manufactured under identical conditions.</p>
<p>Machine-readable means an automatic identification technology media, such as bar codes, contact memory buttons, radio frequency identification, or optical memory cards.</p>
<p>Original part number means a combination of numbers or letters assigned by the enterprise at item creation to a class of items with the same form, fit, function, and interface.</p>
<p>Parent item means the item assembly, intermediate component, or subassembly that has an embedded item with a unique item identifier or DoD recognized unique identification equivalent.</p>
<p>Serial number within the enterprise identifier means a combination of numbers, letters, or symbols assigned by the enterprise to an item that provides for the differentiation of that item from any other like and unlike item and is never used again within the enterprise.</p>
<p>Serial number within the part, lot, or batch number means a combination of numbers or letters assigned by the enterprise to an item that provides for the differentiation of that item from any other like item within a part, lot, or batch number assignment.</p>
<p>Serialization within the enterprise identifier means each item produced is assigned a serial number that is unique among all the tangible items produced by the enterprise and is never used again. The enterprise is responsible for ensuring unique serialization within the enterprise identifier.</p>
<p>Serialization within the part, lot, or batch number means each item of a particular part, lot, or batch number is assigned a unique serial number within that part, lot, or batch number assignment. The enterprise is responsible for ensuring unique serialization within the part, lot, or batch number within the enterprise identifier.</p>
<p>Type designation means a combination of letters and numerals assigned by the Government to a major end item, assembly or subassembly, as appropriate, to provide a convenient means of differentiating between items having the same basic name and to indicate modifications and changes thereto.</p>

<p>(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br /><br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier s quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jan 2017) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.<br />(a) Inspection/Acceptance. <br />(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.<br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.<br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]<br />(5) <br />(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may-<br />(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or<br />(B) Terminate this contract for cause.<br />(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.<br />(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to--<br />(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or<br />(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.<br />(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.<br />(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.<br />(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

It includes, but is not limited to, purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders.<br />(i) Payments.<br />(1) Work performed. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer:<br />(i) Hourly rate.<br />(A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis.<br />(B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.<br />(C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative.<br />(D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract.<br />(E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis.<br />(1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated.<br />(2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(3) If the Schedule provided rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.<br />(ii) Materials.<br />(A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--<br />(1) Quantities being acquired; and<br />(2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.<br />(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor-<br />(1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or<br />(2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.<br />(C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall-<br />(1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and<br />(2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract.<br />(D) Other Costs.

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.<br />(3) Ceiling price.

The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance.

The objective of this amendment is to address Vendor questions relative to the Market Survey.


***** 6/26/2017 AMENDMENT POSTED *****

QUESTIONS: Questions regarding this market survey are due on June 29, 2017 no later than 2:00 pm eastern daylight time (EDT). Your question(s) should be emailed to Andrea Roman Anderson at andrea.roman.anderson@faa.gov. Reference the title and solicitation number in your email.

Introduction/Purpose

This market survey is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1 Market Analysis. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors including Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) firms and other small business concerns. This market survey also seeks to identify potential vendors for this requirement. The FAA’s Office of Financial Analysis has a need to procure a subscription service to provide historical and time-series cost services and labor, material, and services escalation services. More detailed descriptions of the types of professional services required are provided in the attached draft statement of work (SOW). The acquisition strategy for this requirement has not yet been determined at present. Therefore, information submitted in response to this Market Survey will be used, by the FAA, to support the decision as to whether the requirement will be set aside for only small/or small and disadvantaged businesses or competed on an unrestricted basis. Not responding to this market survey does not preclude participation in any future Requests for Information (RFI) and/or Screening Information Requests (SIRS) related to this requirement; if any are issued.

North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code

The projected NAICS code for this procurement is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, Size Standard $27.5 million.

Period of Performance and Contract Type

Apply a compacted gravel ramp to all camp site parking spaces.  Use certified weed-free crushed gravel, ¾" minus. Taper ramp from edge of new asphalt for three feet.  Gravel edging shall be approximately 10 feet wide.
Clean gravel previously excavated from the Ohanapecosh utility trench repair work may be re-used for gravel edging into the camp sites.
