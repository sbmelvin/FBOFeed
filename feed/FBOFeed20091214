<DESC>Architect/ Engineer Design New Nuclear Medicine DepartmentStratton VA Medical CenterThis is a pre-solicitation notice synopsizing an upcoming competitive solicitation to satisfy the requirements of FAR 5.201, 5.203 and 36.6.The Samuel S. Stratton VA Medical Center (hereafter "The VA" or "VA"), located at 113 Holland Ave., Albany NY 12208, is seeking qualified AE Firms for award of a Firm Fixed Price Architect Engineer Contract to perform the AE services outlined below described herein.  Request for Proposals (RFP), for project entitled "New Nuclear Medicine Department" will be posted to the Government-wide Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov) on or about December 18, 2009. The applicable NAICS code will be 541310, with an applicable small business size standard of $4.5 Million.The estimated construction value of this project falls within the range of $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.THE PRIMARY WORK FOR THE NEW NUCLEAR MEDICINE DEPARTMENT INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:The project includes design and construction period services for the creation of an approximately 8500 to 9000 square foot addition to the Radiation Therapy Building to relocate the Nuclear Medicine Department at the Stratton VA Medical Center.  The addition is necessary to provide space for a new PET/CT suite and to bring the Nuclear Medicine department up to VA standards.The addition will be constructed on a new foundation, adjacent to the existing Radiation Therapy Building. The addition may tie in to some or all of the Radiation Therapy building utilities. A functional Nuclear Medicine Department shall include two nuclear medicine scanning rooms, thyroid uptake room, radiopharmacy, cardiac stress testing room, bone densitometry room, a PET/CT suite and all necessary staff and patient support areas. Efficient workflow is essential, with sufficient clearances to easily maneuver bariatric patient beds.The PET/CT (Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography) suite will house one complete set of the large, complex, highly-specialized equipment. The machinery itself will be installed by a third-party vendor. Since PET scans utilize higher-energy radiopharmaceuticals than other nuclear medicine procedures, the entire suite requires additional lead shielding. The suite must include the scanner room, operator room, equipment room, at least two patient dose administration rooms, a dedicated patient toilet and a dedicated radiopharmacy. Based on VA design guides and manuals and all relevant codes, including the federal requirements for energy efficiency, the A/E shall provide design development including a proposed layout. After the approved layout is completed, the A/E shall perform all work necessary to prepare the specifications, drawings, and bidding documents for the subject project. A/E also shall provide services during the solicitation phase and construction phase.The Contracting Officer will not be able to answer any questions to this notice until a Request for Proposal is issued and only by Request for Information (RFI's)

<DESC>The US Army CECOM Contracting Center Army Contracting Command, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000, intends to issue a modification to the existing Firm Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract, number W15P7T-05-D-W204, to continue the procurement of support services for the Common Ground Station (CGS)/Joint Services Workstation (JSWS), which is part of the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, from General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S), Scottsdale, AZ. The Government does not possess all of the detailed design information or specifications that any source, other than GDC4S, would need in order to perform the required services for the CGS/JSWS. GDC4S is the configuration manager for the CGS/JSWS and controls the design below the performance specification level. GDC4S proprietary data, to include drawings, software, source codes, and test and calibration procedures and equipment, is needed to assure interoperability and interchangeability of CGSs/JSWSs and their parts. Only GDC4S possesses the unique knowledge of the CGS/JSWS design and consequently, it is the only source that can provide the required services and spare parts. The intended resulting contract modification will be for a six (6) month period of performance for services until a follow-on long-term contract is awarded. This sole source procurement is authorized under FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and 10USC2304(c)(1).<BR><BR>For further information regarding this action, please contact Michael Furey, Contract Specialist, at 732-532-8362, michael.p.furey@us.army.mil or Linda Schmidt, Contracting Officer, at 732-427-1323, Linda.Schmidt1@conus.army.mil.<BR>

The groups will be compared to determine if there is a difference in levels of markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and antioxidants between these groups and between acute and convalescent serum. 

The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to conduct this acquisition on an unrestricted full and open competition basis under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by negotiation. The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract for the services.  NAICS 541711

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Labors Employment and Training Administration (ETA) will be soliciting proposals to assist ETA in providing technical assistance in support of its YouthBuild programs.  The contractor will provide support for all related technical activities required by ETA.   

YouthBuild is a youth workforce development program that helps disadvantaged youth gain high school credentials and skill training that leads to employment.  YouthBuild provides job training and educational opportunities for at-risk, and out-of-school youth ages 16 through 24 while constructing or rehabilitating affordable housing for low-income or homeless families in poor communities.  While enrolled in a YouthBuild program, participants split their time between a construction site and a classroom, where they earn their GED or high school diploma, learn to be community leaders, and prepare for college and other postsecondary training opportunities.  

The YouthBuild program was transferred from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the Department of Labor (DOL) in September 2006. The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) began administration of the YouthBuild program beginning in FY 2007. DOL has administered one full cycle of the YouthBuild program (two years of program operation) since its transfer and has recently completed its second competition.  This competition, which utilized both American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) funds of $50 million as well as the 2009 appropriation funds of $70 million resulted in an increase in the number of YouthBuild programs supported by DOL and the number of disadvantaged youth served.   

The successful offeror will provide technical assistance to approximately 200 grantees for the first period of performance.  

The purpose of the YouthBuild Technical Assistance contract is to support ETA in the provision of services that will improve program performance and program outcomes for participants in DOL funded YouthBuild programs in the areas of:  
	--Placement in employment or education 
	--Attainment of a degree or certificate
	--Literacy and numeracy gains
	--Retention in employment and education
	--Reduction in recidivism rates 

The technical assistance will assist YouthBuild grantees to improve academic offerings, provide industry-recognized construction skill training, introduce YouthBuild staff and participants to high-growth, high-wage industries, and make stronger connections with other system partners to prepare our nations most vulnerable youth for productive lives. 
The overall goals for the technical assistance strategy are to assist YouthBuild sites to: 
	--Improve academic programs including professional development for teaching    staff and GED curricula 
	--Improve literacy/numeracy outcomes 
	--Increase post-secondary exploration, planning, and placement 
	--Integrate nationally recognized energy efficiency and renewable energy training into existing construction training programs
	--Improve connections to registered apprenticeship programs 
	--Improve connections to business partners, both nationally and at the local level 
	--Improve connections to the One-Stop Career Center system 
	--Improve connections with community colleges 
	--Improve and ensure occupational safety at YouthBuild work sites 
	--Use data to manage programs 
	--Strengthen partnerships with other government agencies that serve the neediest youth including the juvenile justice system, the foster care system, etc. 

ETAs authority to use these funds is limited by the YouthBuild authorizing statute.  Under that law, the only entities we have authority to select for contracts funded with the YouthBuild 5% funds for training, information, technical assistance and data management, ... are qualified national nonprofit agencies." 29 USC 2918a(f).  

There will be a pre-proposal conference.  Interested Parties should send an e-mail to Marsha Daniels (daniels.marsha@dol.gov) with their intent to attend.

This is a Market Survey announcement.  This Market Survey is being released in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management Policy (AMS) policy 3.2.1.2.1.  The responses to this Market Survey will be used for information purposes only and will not be released. Proprietary information will be protected if appropriately marked.  This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of a product, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) nor Request For Proposal (RFP). The FAA is neither seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.
All parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs associated with any response received in response to this announcement.  Any costs associated with the Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Responses to this Market Survey will be used to develop a Source List which will be used if a solicitation for this requirement is issued.  The information identified from this Market Survey may result in a restricted screening process if an RFP is issued.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The Government has identified the principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS code) 334511 Search, Detections, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, with a size standard of 750.  If you believe that another NAICS code can be responsive to the work specified in this market survey, include supporting justification with your alternate NAICS code.  Suggestion of an alternate NAICS code does not require that the work be set-aside or solicited under that alternative code.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must maintain and sustain the existing Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) Program Satellite Communication Segment.  Currently, two satellites and the corresponding requisite four Geostationary Uplink Subsystems are operational and have been leased through July 2017.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br /> <br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National 	Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, 	Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (LBMB), plans to procure on a sole source basis  with Photonic Instruments Inc., 2435 Dean St., Unit A, St. Charles, Illinois 60175 for an upgrade of a MicroPoint Laser System with computer controlled galvanometer beam-steering module. <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Delivery will be within 30-60 days of receipt of order.</p>
<p>The LBMB investigates molecular and biochemical processes of chromosomes structure, remodeling and inheritance.  In addition to numerous biochemical, molecular genetics and molecular biology techniques employed in these studies, researchers at LBMB also utilize live cell imaging to address in vivo distribution and dynamics of chromatin proteins and complexes tagged with GFP and other fluorescent tags.</p>
<p>The LBMB's requires a high power laser beam with the ability to illuminate diffraction limited area of the live yeast cell nucleus. Other necessary characteristics include ability to choose illumination wavelength, precise control of laser power, proper safety interlocks to protect operator from injury.  Due to fast rotation of yeast nucleus, such laser needs to be equipped with beam-steering optics allowing fast targeting of areas to be illuminated.  Moreover, control software needs to interface with data generated by separate imaging camera and computer in such a way as not to interfere with their operations. The whole laser and steering optics need to be mounted on the rear aperture port of the inverted microscope - therefore they need to be compact and have proper adapters.<br /> <br />The LBMB has an older model Micro-Point system (with stationary laser beam). This unit  satisfies requirements regarding laser power, available laser emission wavelengths and ability to concentrate laser beam to a diffraction limited spot of about 250nm diameter at the focal point of microscope objective. However, to make it suitable to current experimental conditions, it needs to be upgraded by the addition of computer-controlled galvanometric beam displacer module.  Because this is an upgrade of an existing older instrument, necessary parts and service are highly specialized and cannot be obtained from other sources without potentially compromising operation of the instrument as well as safety of personnel using it, as it contains high-power nitrogen laser-pumped dye laser.<br /> <br /> The technical characteristics of the required upgrade are listed below:<br />&bull;	Addition of beam steering optics (galvanometer controlled mirrors) to existing MicroPoint Laser System (manual, stationary beam version) manufactured by Photonics Instruments Inc.<br />&bull;	Addition of proper mechanical adapters to attach instrument to Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 inverted microscope<br />&bull;	Software, frame grabber card and video converter to allow interfacing with existing camera (Hamamatsu C9100-13) and imaging computer</p>
<p>Technical requirements for galvanometer controlled mirrors and auxiliary optics:<br />&bull;	required to withstand peak laser pulse of at least 12kW at pulsewidth of 3-5nsec.<br />&bull;	Required to maintain diffraction limited, circular spot (250nm diameter) at focal point of 100x microscope objective.<br />&bull;	Reflectivity range of mirrors and transmission range of all other optical elements: 365nm to 700nm<br />&bull;	No effects on polarization characteristics of the original laser beam.<br />&bull;	Attenuation filter: Motorized, 90 steps, 0.1%-100% transmission</p>
<p>Technical requirements for computer control interface:<br />&bull;	USB<br />&bull;	Control features: Beam pointing (x and y), attenuation, laser trigger (fire) command<br />&bull;	Resolution: 8 bit equivalent with FOV range switching<br />&bull;	Field of view range switching: 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 30% (selectable)</p>
<p>Mechanical adapter requirements<br />&bull;	Adapter for rear port of Zeiss AxioObserver microscope<br />&bull;	Illumination port clear aperture: &Oslash;22mm - &Oslash;34mm<br />&bull;	Illumination port filter size: &Oslash;25mm - &Oslash;38mm</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PCD), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida intends to purchase from Transas Usa, Inc. on a sole source basis for the following item: one (1) each Basic Chart Maintenance Site License which consists of  (4) Transas Navisailor 3000 ECI, (10) Transas Navisailor 2400, and (10) Transas Navisailor 3000 World Chart Folio Updates.  The Site License includes chart corrections and dongles each quarter for a period of one year from date of contract.  The basis for sole source purchase is that the conversion to any other charting system would require the duplication of training that has already been provided for this system, and would entail a similar licensing agreement.  It would not be cost effective to perform this conversion; therefore Transas Usa, Inc. is the only approved source for this requirement.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Equipment will be delivered to the Commander, Naval Special Warfare Group Four, N66/Hicks (757-492-1361), 2220 Schofield Rd, Bldg 117 Norfolk, VA 23521-2485.  NAICS Code 334111 applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The approach to source selection for this procurement will be pursuant to the best value tradeoff concept as identified in FAR Part 15.101-1 and FAR Part 15.3.  It is the Governments intention to award a contract to the offerors whose proposals conform to the RFP requirements and are considered to be most advantageous to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Competitive proposals shall be evaluated and assessed based on the factors specified in this solicitation.  The technical evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance: 1) Past Performance, 2) Management Plan, and 3) Management and Key Personnel Qualifications. For this solicitation, the combined weight of the technical evaluation factors is more important than price. 

The technical proposals will be reviewed and evaluated prior to and separately from the review of the price proposals.  GSA intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.  GSA reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If a competitive range is established, in accordance with FAR 15.102, offerors included in the competitive range may be required to participate in an oral presentation/interview with the GSA Source Selection Evaluation Board at the William S. Moorhead Federal Office Building.

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference at the William S. Moorhead Federal Office Building on January 20, 2010, 10:00 AM (EST). The purpose of this conference is to provide a briefing on the contracting concept, and the scope of the work so that offerors can ascertain the general conditions that could materially affect their proposed price and technical submission.

We consider attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive and cost effective proposal and to understand the total result desired by the Government.  Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions and miscalculations in proposals.  It is again emphasized that it is most advantageous for each offeror to have qualified representation at the Pre-Proposal Conference.

Contractors are requested to email Mr. Jesse A. Cohen, GSA Contracting Officer, at Jesse.Cohen@gsa.gov, with the names of the persons who will attend the conference.  Notification before the scheduled meeting is mandatory.

This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice. To ensure that you receive all information regarding this solicitation, please register to receive updates at www.fbo.gov. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. Potential offerors must register on the FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov) to have access to solicitation material. The Solicitation (RFP) will only be available electronically.  It is anticipated that the Solicitation will be available on or about December 29, 2009.

<p>Royal Air Maroc Operations Optimization Feasibility Study</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Royal Air Maroc Operations Optimization project.</p>
<p>Consistent with the Government of Morocco's long term plan to increase tourism, international aviation traffic to and from Morocco has been increasing significantly over the past decade. Royal Air Maroc (RAM) is Morocco's flag carrier and currently serves over six million passengers a year in over 69 destinations, 57 of them international. RAM's international traffic has seen uninterrupted double-digit growth since 2004, at an average rate of 15% annually. In 2007, air liberalization policies changed the air transport regulatory framework of Morocco and the country signed an open skies agreement with the European Union, which resulted in the emergence of new low cost airlines from Europe and the Middle East. The introduction of these new low cost competitors has exerted significant pressure on RAM, which has seen its international flight market share decrease from 56% in year 2000 to 48% in year 2008. In response, RAM has developed a business strategy that includes the development of medium and long-haul routes operated from the hub in Casablanca.</p>
<p>Operational and infrastructure improvements are needed at the Casablanca airport hub in order for RAM to increase its efficiency and capacity. RAM's current operations have shown some areas where improvement is needed, including flight punctuality, baggage and ground handling and passenger processing. It is vital that RAM improve these processes in order to accommodate increasing numbers of international passengers and meet stricter international regulations such as those of TSA for flights destined to the U.S. The airline recognizes that its operations need to be optimized and that it must develop its Casablanca hub in order to increase its capacity and levels of service. The proposed study will provide the foundation for sustainable long-term growth and allow RAM to respond to future demand and improve its standards of service and level of quality. It will also enable them to respond to increased competition and new developments in the Moroccan aviation sector.</p>
<p>As part of the operations optimization program, the Contractor shall develop an operations improvement plan for Terminal 1 at Casablanca's Mohammed V Airport. This is a priority project for RAM, which considers operation optimization the most crucial step in order to regain market share and consolidate its position in the Moroccan aviation market.

PALLETIZATION REQUIREMENT   8/15/2004

Palletization:  The shipping (transport) containers shall be palletized. The pallets shall be 48-inch length x 40-inch width, general purpose, four-way entry, flush stringer, and double-face non-reversible pallets.  The palletized load shall not exceed 2500 pounds in weight for shipments to the Eastern Distribution Center (Burlington). The palletized load shall not exceed 2000 pounds in weight for shipments to the Western Distribution Center (French Camp and Stockton Locations). The palletized load shall not overhang the pallet deck board edge by more than 1 inch and shall not exceed 53 inches in overall height (including pallet). Less than half pallet loads or loads shipped by small package carrier in acceptable transport packing need not be palletized. When less than full but more than a half pallet is used, the palletized load shall utilize proper bracing and/or reinforcement to ensure that the load can withstand two additional loads placed on it. 

Stacking:  A load-stacking test shall be performed once, at the beginning of the contract, for each different unitized or palletized load configuration. A fully palletized load shall be tested utilizing a total stack of three palletized loads, with all the proper bracing and/or reinforcement necessary to perform the test. There shall be no evidence of damage to the pallets, shipping containers or products when stack is tested on the rigid surface for a minimum of 24 hours, in compliance with all the National and Local Safety Regulations. The pre-tested palletized load configuration shall be duplicated using the same packaging materials, pattern, number of shipping (transport) containers, and procedures consistent throughout the duration of the contract. Palletized loads shall be stable and safe when handled with mechanical equipment by qualified personnel.

Materials:  All lumber used inside or outside a shipment shall be bark free. No used wood pallets with repaired components or stringers will be acceptable. All wood pallet stringers shall be manufactured from hardwoods.  Pallets manufactured of materials other than wood, shall conform to all the requirements specified herein.

Unitization:  For the purpose of this requirement, the assembled group of containers or items in a single load that can be handled as a unit throughout the distribution system. Unitization encompasses, but is not limited to, consolidation in a container, placement on a pallet or load base having forklift capability, or securely binding together. Shipments should be considered for unitization where appropriate or specified. 
Unitization of pallet load:  The palletized load shall be unitized and secured to the pallet to insure that the load arrives intact without product damage. The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load. Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements. A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping, and/or, by steel or nonmetallic strapping. When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping. As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load. A palletized load shall be capable of protecting the products against damage in a multiple handling, transportation, and storage environment having distribution warehouses with rack systems that support the load/s overhead of warehouse personnel.

Notice of special requirements for shipment to all countries that have endorsed the IPPC Guidelines for treatment of non-manufactured wood packaging:  The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) has approved and published on March 15, 2002,  Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade . Countries endorsing the IPPC Guidelines are found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/swp/. Clause D-FSS-468 requires non-manufactured wood pallets and other non-manufactured wood packaging material used in shipments destined to IPPC compliant countries require the appropriate wood treatment.

The tape applied over the center lengthwise seams shall extend at least 3 inches onto each of the 
end panels. The manufacturer's joint shall be taped to establish a completely sealed container. 
The sealed box shall be exposed outdoors for 12 months in a louvered shed. Upon completion of 
the exposure period, the panels shall be examined visually for conformance to the requirements 
in table I. 

 

 4.5.3 Compatibility with copper. 

 

 4.5.3.1 Preparation of test assembly panel. Three panels of cold rolled, hard temper copper 
conforming to ASTM-B152/B152M and measuring 1/16 by  by 3 inches shall be polished to 
remove pits and irregularities from all surfaces. The panels shall be polished with 240 grit 
aluminum oxide. The use of wet or dry paper is prohibited. Iron oxide abrasives shall not be 
used. The final abrasion shall be in a direction parallel to the length of the panel. Each panel 
shall be bent into a U shape having a radius of -inch and a distance of -inch between side 
walls at the ends. The U-shaped panel shall be wiped clean using laboratory tissue dampened 
with methanol. A sample of wrapping material measuring  by 3 inches shall be tightly 
wrapped around each U shaped panel with the treated side in contact with the copper, so that 
the material is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and at the base of the open section of the 
U. The wrapping material shall be secured with nylon thread. 

 


 4.5.3.2 Procedure. Fifty ml of a solution of glycerine and distilled water having a specific 
gravity of 1.103 at 75  3 F shall be poured into a wide-mouth glass jar of one pint capacity to 
provide a relative humidity of 85  3 percent at 150  2 F. A glass vessel for use as a stage shall 
be inverted and placed inside the jar. The three wrapped panels shall be placed around the 
perimeter of the stage with both legs of the inverted U resting on the stage in the test jar 
avoiding contact with glycerine solution. The test jar shall be sealed with a screw cap using an 
aluminum foil gasket and placed in a circulating air oven at 150  2 F for 7 days. The test jar 
shall then be removed from the oven, allowed to cool, and the copper panels removed and 
unwrapped. The U shaped specimen shall be visually examined on the inside surface of the 
U for evidence of corrosive effects from the vapor in accordance with ASTM-D130. 

 

 4.5.4 Compatibility with MIL-PRF-131. For VCI-treated sheet materials. The test shall be 
performed as follows in triplicate for each combination of materials along with a control 
incorporating neutral kraft paper in lieu of VCI-treated material. 

 

 4.5.4.1 Assembly of specimens. The specimen of MIL-PRF-131 barrier material shall be 
formed into a pouch by folding the specimen in half and leaving a 36-pound flat surfaced weight 
on the crease for 30 seconds (6 pounds per inch of crease). The short edges shall be sealed to 
form a side-opening pouch 5 inches long. A clean dry steel panel 1/8 by 2 by 4 inches shall be 
wrapped in a specimen of VCI-treated material with the treated surface toward the panel. The 
wrapping shall be closed with a double fold along the lengthwise centerline of the panel, and 
single folds at the ends of the panel. The wrapped panel shall then be inserted into the pouch. 
The excess air shall be pressed out by hand and the pouch closed with an airtight heat seal. 

 

 4.5.4.2 Procedure. Unless otherwise specified, the assembly shall be retained in an oven 
maintained at 150  2 F for 7 days. When the pouch has cooled to room temperature, the sealed 
edge shall be cut away and the wrapped panel shall be removed. The MIL-PRF-131 barrier 
material shall be examined for deterioration and if none is obvious, the material shall be tested 
by bending it with the heat-seal face out around a 1/4-inch-diameter mandrel as prescribed in 
MIL-STD-3010, Method 2003. 

 

5. PACKAGING 

 

 5.1 Packaging. For acquisition purposes, the packaging requirements shall be as specified 
in the contract or order (see 6.2). When packaging of materiel is to be performed by DoD or in-
house contractor personnel, these personnel need to contact the responsible packaging activity to 
ascertain packaging requirements. Packaging requirements are maintained by the Inventory 
Control Points packaging activities within the Military Service or Defense Agency, or within 
the military services system commands. Packaging data retrieval is available from the 
managing Military Departments or Defense Agencys automated packaging files, CD-ROM 
products, or by contacting the responsible packaging activity. 

 

 


6. NOTES 

 

 (This section contains information of a general or explanatory nature that may be helpful, 
but is not mandatory.) 

 

 6.1 Intended use. The treated carriers covered by this specification are intended for use in 
specialized military methods of preservation. The combination of all performance characteristics of 
MIL-PRF-3420; vapor inhibitor ability; vapor inhibitor ability after exhaustion; long term 
protection; contact corrosivity; blocking resistance; water resistance of markings provide the 
necessary requirements for protection from exposure to the extremes of the navy/naval aviation 
environment. Navy/naval aviation items are exposed to high moisture, high salt concentration, 
transfer at sea, rough handling, and minimal storage conditions. There are no commercial 
equivalents that meet the physical, mechanical, and corrosion requirements necessary to protect 
materiel that are exposed to the operational naval aviation environment. MIL-STD-2073-1 uses 
MIL-PRF-3420 as the premier source of wrapping material coated or impregnated with a volatile 
corrosion inhibitor that provides protection for applicable items encountering the above conditions. 
MIL-PRF-3420 provides the building blocks for applying specialized military preservation 
techniques approved under MIL-STD-2073-1. 

 

 6.1.1 End use required compatibility testing. Materials may not be used to package 
assemblies containing plastic, painted, or rubber components, unless the specific inhibitor has 
passed the compatibility test specified in MIL-I-8574. Additionally, VCI materials should not be 
used in applications where they might come in contact with high explosives or propellants 
associated with ammunition. Procedures covering the use of VCI materials are specified in MIL-
I-8574. 

 

 6.2 Acquisition requirements. Acquisition documents should specify the following: 

 

 a. Title, number, and date of the specification. 

 

 b. Class and style of treated carrier (see 1.2). 

 

 c. Form (rolls or flat cut sheets) and size required (see 3.4). 

 

 d. Utility rolls (specify quantity). 

 

 e. Packaging requirements (see 5.1). 

 

 6.3 Qualification. With respect to products requiring qualification, awards will be made 
only for products which are, at the time of award of contract, qualified for inclusion in Qualified 
Products List QPL-3420 whether or not such products have actually been so listed by that date. 
The attention of the contractors is called to these requirements, and manufacturers are urged to 
arrange to have the products that they propose to offer to the Federal Government tested for 
qualification in order that they may be eligible to be awarded contracts or purchase orders for the 
products covered by this specification. Information pertaining to qualification of products and 


the letter of authorization for submittal of sample may be obtained from: Commander, Naval Air 
Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 6.7.2.2, Building 562-3, Room 134, Highway 547, 
Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5049. 

 

Carrier material supplied under contract should be identical in every respect to the samples 
tested and found to meet the requirements of this specification. Any unapproved changes from 
the qualification sample should constitute cause for rejection for material submitted and for 
removal from the list of qualified products. However, acceptability under this specification is 
based on the performance characteristics of the barrier material, and since there is no color 
requirement, it is not mandatory that the color of the visible surfaces of the material supplied 
under contract be the same as the samples tested and accepted by the qualifying activity. 

 

 6.3.1 Submission of qualification samples. Prior to submitting samples for qualification 
testing, manufacturers must request authorization from the qualifying activity. Upon receipt of 
authorization, samples are to be forwarded as directed by the qualifying activity. The samples 
should be plainly and durably marked with the following information:

<DESC>Small Business ConcernsSources Sought for the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)Project Latch ValvesThe Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission is the fourth mission of the SolarTerrestrial Probe (STP) program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA). The MMS mission will use four identically instrumented observatories to performthe first definitive study of magnetic reconnection in space and will test criticalhypotheses about reconnection. Magnetic reconnection is the primary process by whichenergy is transferred from the solar wind to the Earths magnetosphere and is alsofundamental to the explosive release of energy during substorms and solar flares. The MMS mission will study magnetic reconnection in the Earths magnetosphere. The fourMMS observatories will be required to fly in a tetrahedral formation in order tounambiguously determine the orientation of the magnetic reconnection layer. The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI)to solicit information about potential sources for the Latch Valves  for theMagnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Project including sixteen (16) Latch Valve Flight Unitsplus one (1) spare.

<DESC>United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Program Office (CPO), Silver Spring, MD., &nbsp;is exploring options for restructuring its climate applications transition program.
<p>This is request for information (RFI) for Information and Planning Purposes Only, and is not a request for proposal.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals; and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a request for proposal or award a contract as a result of this request. This announcement is a request for information only; therefore, a Request for Proposal (RFP) may not be issued against this RFI. The government will not reimburse the respondent for any cost associated with information submitted in response to this request. All information submitted in response to this RFI is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.</p>
<p>NOAA, CPO is exploring options for restructuring its climate applications transition program. Transition in this case is defined as the transfer of fully mature tools or information products to sustained operations. This RFI seeks input that will guide the program's solicitation for FY2010, as well as the future direction and evolution of the program. Responses to this request for information will help the CPO understand the scope of climate information products that are ready for transition to operations, in addition to the capabilities that exist for transitioning these products to operational endpoints. The CPO also seeks to understand how these products can benefit stakeholders and society as a whole. <br /><br />The CPO seeks information on products and capabilities across sectors (i.e., coastal, water resources, health, energy, etc.). The transition of products across sectors supports the effort to expand NOAA's climate service capabilities by interacting directly with users, while ensuring that information is made available through centralized NOAA portals and data centers. For example, NOAA has already funded the transition of various drought and water resource management information and decision-support products to operational endpoints (i.e., NOAA Regional Climate Centers), in an effort to support the (inter-agency) National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS), while linking products to the associated, centralized U.S. Drought Portal (USDP) (www.drought.gov).</p>
<p>Background<br /><br />Transition Program<br /><br />The overarching objective of the CPO's transition program is to transition fully developed climate tools and products to an operational mode, whereby information is consistently delivered and easily accessible by stakeholders. Solid partnerships between product developers and operational endpoints are essential to the success of these transitions, and all parties are expected to work closely together throughout the entire process. Education and outreach are key components to the transition process. Transitioned products must be marketed appropriately to their intended stakeholders. Partner organizations and extension services are encouraged to be involved in the dissemination of these products. The program may transition climate information products that deal with various timescales, from months to years to long-term climate change. A secondary objective of the program, through collective analysis of the transition projects funded under the program, is to learn how to better accomplish the technology transition process for application and improved risk management. <br /><br />Many of the products transitioned through the program have come out of projects funded under other CPO programs that approach climate applications, both regionally and sectorally. The Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) program researches and addresses complex, climate-sensitive issues at the regional level. The Sectoral Applications Research Program (SARP) explores climate-sensitive issues and applications in key socio-economic sectors. More information about CPO programs may be found at www.climate.noaa.gov.<br /><br />Expanding NOAA's Climate Service Capabilities<br /><br />The transition process is expected to be an important component of the role that NOAA plays nationally in providing climate services. NOAA envisions an enhanced capability for providing essential climate information for more effective decision-making in climate-sensitive regions and sectors. NOAA continues to work with other agencies, including the Department of the Interior, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and others, in maximizing the potential benefits in the provision of climate services. Climate information tools and products that are transitioned to NOAA would support NOAA's effort by providing essential information to decision-makers.</p>
<p>Questions to Address in Response to RFI</p>
<p>1. What climate information products have been developed that could lead to more informed decision-making if operationalized?<br />2. What types of stakeholders would potentially benefit most from these products, and how could these products lead to increased capacity for more informed decision-making?<br />3. Are these products applicable to specific regions? Are they transferrable between regions?<br />4. What are the targeted audiences for these products? Can a lay audience use the products? Are the products targeted toward a more technical audience? Is training required to be able to use the products?<br />5. What capabilities exist for transitioning these products to operations (technological capabilities, etc.) and what obstacles exist to transitioning the products to operations?<br />6. Which entities within NOAA have the most potential for serving as operational endpoints for these products? <br />7. What are the costs associated with the transition of these products to operational endpoints and the education and outreach efforts to support use of the products?<br />8. Provide your firm's capabilities and experience in these areas.</p>
<p>Please limit responses to 5 pages single-spaced, in 12-point font and standard margins on 8.5 by 11 paper.</p>
<p><br />Where to Send Responses, Comments, Questions and Timeframe</p>
<p>Comments, questions, and recommendations may be submitted by mail or e-mail, and should be received by 5:00 p.m. EST, January 8, 2010. Mail responses should be submitted to the following address: Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), ERAD, Attn: Charlene Yaple, 601 East 12th Street Room 1756, Kansas City, MO 64106-2877. E-mail responses should be submitted to the following address: Charlene.a.yaple@noaa.gov. Faxed responses shall be sent to 816-274-6977.</p>

MARKET RESEARCH/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  INTRODUCTIONThe Marine Corps' Combat Development Command (MCCDC) is determined to find the best materiel solution(s) that meet current/future Marine Corps' Sensitive Compartmented Information/Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (SCI/ISR) Communications System (CommSys) needs.  MCCDC seeks industry input to identify potential materiel solutions (i.e., existing and emerging technologies) that satisfy current/future SCI/ISR CommSys capabilities as described below.  Specifically, the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is twofold: (1) identify vendors that are currently providing materiel solutions for use in SCI/ISR CommSys applications; and (2) identify additional vendors and/or existing or emerging technologies that will better enhance the SCI/ISR CommSys capability and Marine Corps' net-centric, interoperable communications, both internally and at the Joint/Coalition level for the 2010 - 2025 timeframe.
BACKGROUNDThe MCCDC's Capabilities Development Directorate (CDD), Intelligence Integration Division (IID) recognizes the need for an end-to-end SCI/ISR CommSys solution to maintain and elevate the ability of the Marine Corps to achieve net-centric, interoperable communications for ISR data and information contained at the SCI level to enhance Battlespace Awareness (BA).  The Marine Corps should be able to address the linkage between SCI and GENSER communications for cross data dissemination in support of operational relevance, the ability to connect with all USMC transmission links within JWICS and NSANET, to define the Network Service capabilities needed at each node and the service that travels between each link, and define the High Bandwidth means for each linkage determined by the Services used at each node.  Fielding of communication systems in support of Urgent Universal Needs Statements requirements and the use of CommSys developed by other DoD Services (i.e. the U.S. Army Trojan Spirit program) have satisfied the need to date.  However, these solutions provide a minimal capability and do not provide viable long-term solution sets to the Marine Corps.  The implementation of a comprehensive SCI/ISR CommSys fulfills BA capabilities.   
CAPABILITIESFuture Marine Corps SCI/ISR communications systems will be required to support the following capabilities:1.	Ability to reliably exchange information via automatic means in a mission timely manner, intra-Marine Corps and with Joint, allied, DoD and non-DoD partners. 2.	Ability to receive and transmit SCI/ISR data over-the-horizon with sufficient bandwidth at all nodes to simultaneously support required services (e.g., digital voice, video, audio, VTC, NSANet and JWICS connectivity, other SCI network connectivity, out-of-band coordination, imagery, graphics, email, organizational messaging, technical exchanges (e.g., chat), and other textual files throughout the Marine Corps SCI enterprise).3.	Ability to transport information into, out of, and throughout this dynamically changing network; end-to-end.4.	Ability to provide multi-point secure (SCI Level) VTC.5.	Ability to support synchronization of SCI/ISR information between Marine Corps units/organizations, theater elements and organizations external to DoD.6.	Ability to maintain services (even if at a gradually reduced capacity).7.	Ability to provide secure information exchanges with GENSER Networks Intra-Marine Corps.8.	Ability to provide secure radio voice communications.9.	Ability to access an SCI Secure Telephone System (STS).10.	Ability to control access to confidential information.11.	Ability to defend integrity of systems and networks.12.	Ability to provide continuity of operations, even through natural disasters, hostile actions, and catastrophic system failure.
REQUIREMENTSVendor technologies and/or materiel solutions should address the following requirements:1.	Capable of single and multi-band SATCOM operation 2.	Capable of communicating while on-the-move  3.	Capable of backup and restoral with minimal or no system degradation4.	Capable of extending a digital backbone into the LAN/WAN architecture5.	Capable of support in the determination of bandwidth requirement  6.	Capable of monitoring resource usage 7.	Capable of effective reallocation of resources as demand changes8.	Capable of sufficient bandwidth to simultaneously provide support of required services9.	Capable of synchronization of network related information10.	Capable of supporting at the Team level the transfer of digital information at the MBps level11.	Capable of being man-portable, limiting spares to replace failed assets12.	Capable of providing single channel voice communications at the SCI level13.	Capable of providing an extended SCI secure phone capability to a minimum of 30 users14.	Capable of using encrypted hard drives15.	Capable of identifying critical network security events16.	Capable of system restoration of mission essential operations and communications, and coordination with national agencies17.	Capable of allowing for the operation of materiel solutions that do not require unique or sophisticated skills 18.	Capable of the SCI/ISR Communications Enterprise to simultaneously support services is critical19.	Capable of ensuring the reliable and continuous exchange of information to and from the intended recipients regardless of whether users are in a static environment or on-the-move20.	Capable of VTCs conducting in multi-point and point-to-point at all echelons of command in both garrison and tactical (down to the Team level) environments21.	Capable of synchronizing system configuration information at both the garrison and tactical level to a central location 22.	Capable of providing a means of managing enterprise assets through a proactive scheme of prioritization should services be interrupted or the capacity to provide services become limited23.	Capable of conducting the seamless, automated exchange of information between the SCI and non-SCI security domains24.	Capable of providing secure SCI-level radio communications, down to the Team level25.	Capable of maintaining SCI-level confidentiality and availability via access control mechanisms and monitoring in the physical and information domains26.	Capable of maintaining the integrity of the physical and information domains by providing protection against the alteration or destruction of networks, systems or information27.	Capable of providing awareness of attacks having taken place, preferably in real-time, from both enemy actors and insider threats28.	Capable of the SCI/ISR Communications Enterprise should be robust  and degrade gracefully against various perturbations including: environmental conditions, hostile attack, system failure and changing or evolving missionsEnvironment:  SCI/ISR CommSys hardware/software suite applications must be able to operate in varying climates and environments to support tactical operations.  The system proposed must address its portability (e.g., man-packable, transportable) capabilities and the ability to operate on-the-move and on-the-pause.

<DESC>Sole source purchase of QIAxcel (catalog number 9001421), QIACube (catalog number 9001292), installation, and miscellaneous items (e.g., starter packs and sample tubes).
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal Plant Health Inspection Services, Plant Protection &amp; Quarantine office in Beltsville, MD intends to award a sole source purchase order to Qiagen, Inc. for a Capillary Electrophoresis system and an Automated DNA purification instrument The rationale for this intention to Sole Source can be found in FAR 6.302-1 ( Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. )<br />The PPQ Molecular Diagnostic Lab (MDL) supports PPQ programs by providing final identifications of targeted quarantine plant pests using molecular and biochemical tests. The results of these diagnostic tests are the basis for making regulatory decisions and taking regulatory actions which are critical in preventing the spread of quarantine pests. The MDL must provide the identifications in a timely manner and most importantly they must be accurate or inappropriate regulatory decisions will be made. It is essential that the equipment used in the diagnostic work be dependable, accurate and rapid.</p>
<p>The QIAxcel system simultaneously performs a fully-automated and high-resolution capillary electrophoresis for up to 96 samples. This system uses a higher throughput (96 versus 20-30) that is fully automated and requires small amounts of DNA to provide robust results. The BioCalculator software that is part of the system provides a rapid and accurate means of evaluating sample testing results, allows viewing results in various forms, and documents results rapidly and accurately.</p>
<p>The QIAcube performs simultaneous fully-automated purification of nucleic acids of up to 12 samples. The purification of DNA is a time-consuming step in the beginning of the process of molecular diagnostics. Most of the protocols that the MDL uses require a Qiagen kit for DNA purification. <br />Interested sources that are capable of providing an equivalent item listed above are encouraged to submit statements of capability to the contracting office. Small Business concerns are encouraged to participate. This is not a request for competitive proposals Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to possibly conduct a competitive procurement in the future. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature. Please provide Tax I.D. Number, Duns Number, point of contact information, past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this item and or service along with your Statement of Capability. The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide. Information provided is strictly voluntary.</p>
<p>Please fax Statements of Capability to Carol Dingess at 612-336-3550 or email to Carol.Dingess@aphis.usda.gov. Email is the preferred method of communication. Telephonic inquiries will not be honored. Closing date for submissions of Statement's of Capability is December 23, 2009 at 4:00PM ET.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order to Kid Risk, Inc., 2 Seaport Lane, 11th Floor, Boston, MA 02210, for the following tasks to be performed seven (7) months from date of award: 1. Obtain and synthesize the existing data related to characterization of subgroups required to accurately model national disease transmission dynamics, and focus on identifying specific model inputs for Northern India and Northern Nigeria. 2. Characterize the dynamic disease model parameters quantitatively by vaccine type and serotype, which is required to support questions related to optimization of different vaccine tools (e.g. monovalent and bivalent OPV and IPV). 3. Develop a framework and comprehensive draft review that outlines the various polio immunity states that can be used to quantitatively characterize disease transmission dynamics and to help organize information for an expert review of the associated evidence. This task will consider literature review of issues related to priming, waning, and context related to modes of viral transmission, which represent concepts that are not covered in the PRC-funded effort and the existing differential equation base (DEB). The task will focus on summarizing the available data in the context of qualification of the essential population immunity states required to model national poliovirus transmission dynamics (i.e. it will go beyond literature reviews that do not provide the overall structural context required for modeling population disease dynamics) and it will identify key data gaps that limit quantification. 4. Use the framework to summarize what is known and unknown about polio disease transmission dynamics and population immunity by each virus type (i.e. serotype and live or inactivated form), provide a rigorous grading of the evidence, and present these for expert review at a workshop that CDC will host. As part of this task, consider existing strategies for "grading" and evaluating evidence and the value of performing such "grading" in the context of this review. 5. Use the information obtained from the expert review to develop the model inputs and uncertainty distributions for the second generation of the DEB model and to specifically develop models for India and Nigeria that will be needed to support efforts to address key pre-eradication policy questions relevant to those countries. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source will satisfy the Agency's requirements because this is the only service that can meet the requirements. No solicitation is being issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes/proposals, however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which, if received by the response date, shall be considered by the Agency. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within discretion of the Government. For contractual questions, contact Tiffney Griner-Esslinger @ tesslinger@cdc.gov.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Modification 52 is to obligate $63,000 in funding in support of Work Assignment 3-103 which has been previously issued. The period of performance for this work assignment will be from April 13, 2009 though March 31, 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WA 3-103 is to support the development of tools and training aligned with the unique aspects of the ARRA for Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) State programs and the borrower community of the DWSRF. This support will include: (a) participating in and providing support to a full day working session with the DWSRF program to support the development of a program oversight strategy for the unique needs of the ARRA funds. The contractor shall provide its expertise in program management, financial management, auditing and risks, and data management; (b) developing a means to transfer data from the DWSRF's Project Management System to the Office of Management &amp; Budget's (OMB) Recovery.gov website; and (c) supporting two (2) web seminars on the DWSRF and ARRA. This support for the webinars shall consist of getting a web seminar service, managing registration, and recording questions and answers during the web seminars. The current value of WA 3-103 is $147,517 with additional funds to be required for Amendment 3 to the work assignment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) plans to issue a SOLE-SOURCE Contract to the Montana State University (MSU), for the MSUs Western Transportation Institute (WTI) to enhance, expand and further the development of the original National University Transportation Facilities resource document developed by the MSU WTI Center in 2008, and to create a searchable database-driven website. The National University Transportation Center Laboratory Facility resource document created and completed by the MSU WTI contains information on existing or planned university-based transportation related research areas and laboratory facilities at National University Transportation Centers (UTC). The goal in developing the document was to (a) provide a reference tool of available national assets that could be used by federal, state, local, tribal, and private sector industry transportation professionals; (b) increase awareness and encourage laboratory utilization; and (c) reduce the potential for redundancy in the facilities offered to maximize federal funding. The original document synthesized laboratory information from eight of the ten national UTCs. The document is an excellent initial resource, but it has two primary drawbacks: (1) it does not yet contain information about the remaining 115 UTCs; and (2) adding information about additional UTCs in the current paper format would create a document that is cumbersome and difficult to update. MSU proposes to work in partnership with the DOT Research and Innovation Technology Administration (RITA) to expand and enhance the original resource document by (a) creating a user friendly UTC laboratory reference tool maximizing the use of laboratories by other universities, public agencies and private entities; and (b) surveying all 125 UTCs to collect similar information on their laboratory facilities; and (c) creating a searchable database-driven website where the information can be posted and easily accessed by users.  Because MSU initially developed the National University Transportation Center Laboratory Facility resource document, and because MSU is the only known entity that has the necessary resources, specialized capabilities and ready access to additional academic and industry expertise, DOTs RITA believes that MSU is uniquely qualified to carry out the specialized nature of the required work at the high level of quality indispensable to DOT.  Notwithstanding the overwhelming SOLE-SOURCE qualifications thought to be possessed by MSU, any organization OTHER THAN MSU that believes it is capable of enhancing, expanding and furthering the development of the original National University Transportation Facilities resource document developed by the MSU Center, by creating a searchable database-driven website, may e-mail a Statement of Qualifications to Mr. Tyrone Moorer, at tyrone.moorer@dot.gov, not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time January 7, 2010.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.

<p>(IV) This procurement is unrestricted and open to all sources. The associated NAICS code is 512110. The business size standard is $27 MILLION.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial services and items:<br />CLIN 0001 - Public Safety Video Quality Project: The Public Safety Video Quality project is a part of the Public Safety Communications Research activities at the US Department of Commerce. The project needs some carefully constructed and analyzed recorded video in order to assign measured values to various aspects of video used for public safety applications. The project needs video recordings of scenes that cover a wide range of quantified levels of various parameters of interest.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows: <br />CLIN 0001- Public Safety Video Quality Project with the following specifications. Provide a plan for review for review of the following items:<br />1. Must have extensive experience and understanding of Department of Homeland quality in Public Safety (VQiPS) and<br />understanding of the application, through past or present participation in VQiPS.<br />2. Complexity. The scenes should thoroughly represent a wide range of levels of complexity. The specific definition of <br />Scene complexity, as well as the upper and lower bounds represented in the scenes, and method of measurement, will be defined by the vendor in cooperation with project staff. Vendor must have experience in defining and quantifying scene complexity in recorded video. <br />3. Target size. Specific objects of interest, or targets, in the scenes should thoroughly represent a wide range of physical <br />sizes. The specific upper and lower bounds of the target size represented in the scenes, and method of measurement of an object's size within the recorded video, will be defined by the vendor in cooperation with project staff. Vendor must have experience in defining and quantifying object size within recorded video. <br />4. Lighting conditions. The scenes should thoroughly represent a wide range of lighting conditions. The specific upper <br />and lower bounds of lighting levels represented in the scenes, and method of measurement of the lighting, will be defined by the vendor in cooperation with project staff. Measurements must be made of the light coming from various scene elements and going to the camera. Vendor must have experience in precisely measuring lighting levels for recorded video.<br />5. Motion. Certain portions of the scenarios should move while others remain constant. The scenes should exhibit a <br />wide range of scene motion as well as camera motion. The moving elements should also vary systematically in content and size. The specific upper and lower bounds of motion levels, and method of its measurement, will be defined by the vendor in cooperation with project staff. Vendor must have experience in precisely measuring the rate of movement of elements within a recorded video. <br />6. Scenarios. The provider will set up a number of scenarios that emulate real-life public-safety applications, but contain <br />carefully controlled objects of interest, or targets. Each scenario will contain a subset of scenes that represent the full range of the parameters of interest (see points 1-4 above). Vendor must have experience with public-safety video applications. <br />7. Targets. The targets will be chosen and provided by the vendor. Test targets can be any number of objects, but must <br />be methodically varied in size throughout the collection of recorded scenes (see point 2 above.) Targets should span a variety of shapes and colors as well. Examples of test targets could be commonly recognizable hand-held objects such as cell-phones, or printed images of specific sizes; there are no limiting criteria as to the exact nature of the target as long as it can be carefully measured and described. Additionally, every scene must be filmed with at least one type of resolution chart<br />8. The recordings will be made using commercially available video cameras, both standard resolution and high <br />definition (HD) resolution. Vendor must have the required camera equipment; it will not be provided by the project. <br />9. The camera/scenario configurations will all be documented, and the camera settings will be recorded. Vendor must <br />have experience in producing thorough scientific documentation. <br />10. The project deliverable will be the video recordings accompanied by the scenario-specific details of the scene <br />contents and recording parameters. <br />11. The recordings will be subjected to a parametric set of compression approaches by project staff, and these altered <br />recordings may be resubmitted to the vendor for analysis in order to determine if the parameters of interest have changed due to the compression of the video. The recordings will undergo subjective quality testing conducted by project staff, and analysis will be performed on the effects of each parameter on the resolving power of the resulting video.<br />12. Costs are not to exceed $18,000.00.<br />CLIN 0002 - I-Beam Trolley Top with Anti Twist.<br />(VII) Place of delivery is FOB Destination to NOAA, 325 Broadway, Bldg 22 Boulder, CO 80305.

Brand Name Justification:
IHS adopted the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) VistA Imaging (VI) System program in 2006, to serve as its multimedia component for the RPMS Electronic Health Record (HER).  VI enables HER users to view scanned documents and clinical images (photos, radiographs, etc/) that are linked to a patients electronic record.  It also provides Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) capabilities for the long-term storage of images.

Because VI is classified as a Medical Device by the FDA, the VHAs VI development office is required to certify hardware and software configurations that are available for sites to purchase.  Sites with VI Systems run a certified configuration in order to remain in compliance.  
IHS is in the process of procuring new VI equipment and software for the Areas not currently using the program and purchasing additional equipment for the Areas that need to expand.  

The VA has certified the ImageGear software for the VistA Imaging System and it is required for all VistA Imaging Systems.  ImageGear is only produced by Pegasus Imaging Corporation.  Pegasus does not have resellers for the IG MD SVR License: Medical W32 Medical Imaging Functionality Configuration.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-37).  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intend to procure a Foreign Biomedical Researcher Associate, Level 3 from Oak Ridge Associate University. Oak Ridge Associated University is an "H-1B cap-exempt" organization. Oak Ridge Associated University (ORAU) is the only organization (known to NIH) that is able and willing to provide and appoint the government with temporary foreign workers on the H-1B visa during periods when H-1B visas are not available to other organizations, owing to the H-1B cap.  The foreign workers participate in the intramural research programs at NIH.  Oak Ridge will recruit candidates, process applications, facilitate the selection of participants and make appointments to selected individuals to engage in ongoing research programs in designated NIH programs.  The ORAU is an ^H-1B cap-exempt^ organization, willing to appoint foreign contract workers to participate in the intramural research programs at the National Institutes of Health.  it is the only such organization that has been so identified.  Without the availability of ORAU contract workers, able to be appointed on the H-1B visa, the essential biomedical research efforts of the NIH will be highly disadvantaged.
<p>In addition, ORAU participants are provided opportunities for professional travel and training, with coordination and reimbursement processes handled directly by ORAU, reducing operating costs for the NIH for these services.  VISA services will also be handled directly by ORAU, reducing operating costs for the NIH.</p>
<p>ORAU participants are assigned to an NIH scientist who will serve as mentor and collaborator in appropriate research projects.  The appointments provide participants with an opportunity to learn more about the NIH and it's various research programs while gaining valuable knowledge and skills.  The experience provides the basis for continued involvement in future NIH projects.  The appointments promote the current and future missions of the NIH by supporting important contributions to current projects and creating a pool of professionals from which to draw for future efforts. The Contractor will appoint temporary foreign biomedical research associates on the H-1B Visa to participate in the Intramural Research Programs Programs for biomedical research associates at the NIH.  The objective is to allow NIH to appoint foreign biomedical research associate to work on packaging of viral and host factors into HIV particles. The services provided by the foreign biomedical research associate will be the Biological Significance and Interaction of HIV Proteins. The Contractor will provide Visa services.  The Contractor will assign foreign biomedical research associate with professional travel, training, and travel reimbursement. The research associate will be assigned to an NIH scientist who will serve as mentor and collaborator in appropriate research projects. The appointments provide participants with an opportunity to learn more about the NIH and its various research programs while gaining valuable knowledge and skills. The experience provides the basis for continued involvement in future NIH projects. The appointments promote current and future missions of NIH by supporting important contributions to current projects and creating a pool of professionals from which to draw future efforts.

<p>This modification is for the following;<br /><br />1. Section F of the solicitation is hereby deleted and replaced with:</p>

<p align="left">U.S. Peace Corps<br />Office of the Chief Information Officer<br />Attention: Theodore Leach<br />1111 20th Street NW<br />Washington DC, 20526<br /><br />2. Responses to Questions:</p>
<p>1. A question regarding C.3.1 of the specification. The spec calls for upgrade capabilities of the UPS module to support an additional 20 kVA for future growth. I question this need for the following reasons.</p>
<p>a. You have asked for the paralleling cabinet to be sized for an additional module for capacity. This allows for 100 kVA of growth.</p>
<p>Answer: <br />No. The intent is to have the ability to add another unit if ever required. Not neccesarily for an additional 100kVA system.</p>
<p>b. The feeders to the room are 200 amp. These are the correct size for a 100 kVA UPS. The 200 amps will not support an additional 20 kVA.</p>
<p>Answer: <br />Yes this is true and we are aware that additional feeds would be required if additional growth were to occur. Adding additional input feeds to the UPS system is not part of this proposal.</p>
<p>c. The PDUs that are specified are 100 kVA. They will not support the additional 20 kVA.</p>
<p>Answer: <br />Yes this is true and we are aware that additional PDUs would be required if additional growth were to occur. Adding additional PDUs beyond the two specified in the SOW is not part of this proposal.</p>
<p>2. PC-10-Q-RM01 RFQ page 5, paragraph C.2 states that the contractor shall supply and install the UPS for the Peace Corps within 45 days after receipt of order. However, during the site visit, we were led to believe this work had to be completed between the hours of 6 PM Friday through 6AM Monday. This stipulation was not covered in the referenced document, and we would like to know if the weekend work is for each UPS system to be installed, for the PDU's and feeders to be installed, and what are the actual work hours and limitations upon access to the facility (i.e. parking, storage, work prep areas, location for gang boxes, etc)? Additionally can we have personnel performing site prep work during week night hours (6 PM to 6AM) or during normal business hours (8am - 5PM)?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />It was specified in the original document that all work will be performed outside of normal business hour in section C.3.5A. UPS Installation. The reference to work to be performed between 6 P.M. Friday and 6 A.M. Monday refers to the actual power down, removal of the existing UPS equipment and installation of the new UPS equipment required to maintain power to the Peace Corps Datacenter. Work that does not require nor will result in a power outage of any kind, or that would not create an excessive amount of noise or distubance to Peace Corps staff may be scheduled during normal business hours in coordination with the Peace Corps assigned technical lead for this project. There are no allowances for parking, storage, work areas, or the placement of gang boxes on site.</p>
<p>3. PC-10-Q-RM01 amendment 2 has added the requirement to install two new input feeders from the new UPS output panel to the new PDU's, as well as furnish and install new blue and yellow power cables with various receptacles.</p>
<p>a.) What line item will this be part of for the proposal cost and bid? <br />b.) Does the Peace Corps have drawings of the facilities, disconnects and/or transfer switches which can be provided for this RFQ?</p>
<p>Answers: <br />Section C.3.2 was and is the line item to be referenced for the cost of the PDU equipment.</p>
<p>Section C.3.5.B was updated to indicate the length of the power cables and properly reflect the number of power cables required for each PDU. Installation of the PDU and the associated cabling should be reflected in the response to this section.</p>
<p>A drawing of the area in which the equipment is to be installed is available. No drawings of disconnects and / or transfer switches are available.</p>
<p>4. Does the Peace Corps have a specific schedule for the installation of specific components for this task (i.e. Parallel Cabinet with the Old/New UPS and PDUs being changed out over time)?</p>
<p>Answers: <br />It was specified in the original document that all work will be performed outside of normal business hours in section C.3.5A. UPS Installation. The reference to work to be performed between 6 P.M. Friday and 6 A.M. Monday refers to the actual power down, removal of the existing UPS equipment and installation of the new UPS equipment required to maintain power to the Peace Corps Datacenter. Work that does not require nor will result in a power outage of any kind, or that would not create an excessive amount of noise or disturbance to Peace Corps staff may be scheduled during normal business hours in coordination with the Peace Corps assigned technical lead for this project.</p>
<p>5. After each new UPS is installed;</p>
<p>a.) where does the Peace Corps plan on having the old UPS equipment moved to?</p>
<p>b.) when does the old UPS equipment need to be moved?</p>
<p>c.) who will be tasked with the removal and/or disposition of the old UPS/PDU equipments?</p>
<p>Answers: <br />The old UPS equipment will be removed by the respondent and is required to have all removed equipment off-site as soon as it is removed from the building. There are no facilities for storage of the old UPS equipment once it has been removed from its current location.</p>
<p>Section C.3.5A. UPS Installation states:</p>
<p>Disconnect and remove the two existing UPS systems and their associated battery cabinets.</p>
<p>Provide EPA certification letter to verify proper disposal of all components removed.</p>
<p>6. C.3.5A., third bulleted item, is the Peace Corps aware of any items beside batteries and/or electronic circuit boards/modules where EPA certification of disposal is required for any removed components?</p>
<p><br />Answer: <br />No.</p>
<p>7. C.3.5A, 10th bulleted item, Building limitations</p>
<p>a.) Is there a loading/unloading area for the building that is off the street and away from traffic?</p>
<p>b.) Are there palette jacks and heavy duty coasters for moving equipment inside the building or should these be provided?</p>
<p>c.) Is the elevator set up to handle freight and what is the elevator door opening width and height?</p>
<p>Answers:<br />Yes. It is a street level loading / unloading area. A liftgate truck will be required.</p>
<p>No. Any moving equipment required will have to be provided by the respondent.</p>
<p>No. Only passenger style elevators are available. The elevator door opening is 42" x 84" and the depth from the rear of the car to the closed door is approximately 50".</p>
<p>8. Can the Peace Corp provide copies of single line drawings of the UPS/Electrical system that is currently installed?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />No. None are available</p>
<p>9. C.2 Objective - Can the 45 days be extended, since some materials and/or items for the new systems could approach a 10 week delivery time after the order is placed, we would not be able to meet this requirement, or could this be changed to read 45 days after the contractor has received all equipment for the new system?<br /><br />Answer: <br />Yes the 45 days can be extended and will be extended to 90 days after date of order.<br /><br />10. Are existing PDU's to remain?<br /><br />Answer:<br />Yes as per section 3.5.A, Convert (1) existing PDU from 280VAC input back to 480VAC input. Note: Rewiring of PDU assumes that the internal transformer in PDU is Functional. Intercept the two existing output feeders leaving the UPS room and tie them into new output panel. These conduits go to the existing PDU's. So yes, the existing PDU's stay and should be wired into the new system.<br /><br />11. The response due date remains the same at 3:00 pm local Washington D.C. time on 18 December 2009. All quotes shall be submitted to rmoore@peacecorps.gov. Late quotes may not be accepted, based upon the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>12. All other terms and conditions remain the same.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post questions & answers regarding the Statement of Work, and to extend the Request for Quotes due date to 18 December 2009 at 12:00:00 PM.The Performance Work Statement for this requirement is also provided below:STATEMENT OF WORK Emergency Management Planfor theAlaska Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, Anchorage Alaska.1.0.   General:  The primary purpose of this work is to develop an all-hazards emergency management plan, emergency operations plan and procedures for the Alaska Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (AVAHS).  With the deliverables listed below, AVAHS hopes to define the actions the Main Clinic, Domiciliary, and Community Based Outpatient/Outreach Clinics should be taking to prepare, respond to, and recover from an emergency.  2.0.  Deliverables:2.1.  Delivery of specific information that is aligned with the overall purpose as described above. 2.2.  Emergency Management Plan that meets the Joint Commission (TJC) requirements for Ambulatory Care, Laboratory, Home Health, and Behavioral Health.2.3.  Develop an all hazards Emergency Operations Plan that meets the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and TJC requirements.  This document will be designed to be scaled down to the local facility level, and enhanced with the unique attributes of each facility.  Each identified facility/activity will have a customized plan.2.4.  Develop incident specific standard operating procedures (SOP's), Response Plans and job action sheets (JAS) utilizing the format provided.2.5.  Develop a Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP).2.6.  Develop and build Emergency Management binders for Incident Operations Management Team members.  Documents from B, C, D, and E above will be organized into appropriate binders.2.7.  Work with Alaska Federal Healthcare Partnership (AFHP) to align the above documents with theirs.3.0.  Delivery Schedule:  All work and materials will be submitted in draft to the Chair of the Emergency Management Committee within ninety (90) days of contract award.  Emergency Management Committee will review within fifteen (15) days of draft receipt and return to contractor for final submittal fifteen (15) days later.Questions & Answers: 1) Does the SOW cover the inpatient treatment facility, and if so, how many beds and specialty activities (i.e., dialysis clinics, open-heart/transplant surgery, comprehensive scope of services?)   184,000 sf full-service outpatient clinic.  No beds.  2 OR's, 2 GI rooms, dental, lab, radiology, the normal stuff.  400-450 staff.  Building occupancy, except for ambulatory surgery suite.2) Could you confirm the number of treatment sites (Main Clinic, Domiciliary, and Community Based Outpatient/Outreach Clinics) included in the above description?  New clinic (as described above), 50-bed homeless veteran domiciliary, CBOC in Kenai and Wasilla, Outreach Clinic in Juneau, clinic in the Northway Mall down the street.3) War Planning contingencies with DOD?  Not war planning, but emergency planning with the VA/AF Joint Venture Hospital on Elmendorf AFB.  Our new facility is right next door.  We should coordinate our responses.4) Coordination with Indian Health Service (IHS)?  Coordination with the Alaska Federal Health Care Partnership (AFHCP) consisting of Air Force, Army, IHS, Coast Guard, etc.5) Destinations accessible only by air?  Juneau6)  The title of the SOW indicates Emergency Management Plan (EMP), however, SOW paragraph 2.3 indicates Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). FEMA Comprehensive Planning Guide (CPG) 101 describes plan requirements for an EOP, while NFPA standard 1600 describes requirements for an EMP. Both the FEMA CPG 101 and NFPA 1600 are NIMs compliant, and while similar, do have some differing requirements.Our experience has been that developing an EOP provides for greater flexibility in producing all hazards emergency checklists and suggest the client consider using the EOP requirements in CPG 101.In addition, the SOW calls out a COOP. Is the FEMA COOP format acceptable to the client?We are a health care facility.  We are accredited by the Joint Commission.  As such, we must comply with the Emergency Management Chapter of the Ambulatory Care Accreditation Manual.  In this document, they refer to an Emergency Management Plan (EMP). Yes, FEMA COOP is acceptable.7)  Typically, our plan development efforts incorporate plan training to key staff and conducting a tabletop exercise to familiarize key staff with the plan. Does the client wish the training and exercise component?No exercise or training components are required at this point.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>The Information Directorate, Computing Technology Applications Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to explore and develop computer architectures with greater capacity, sophistication and assurance for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), trusted/secure systems and performance requirement driven layered information processing battlefield networks. Additional innovative technology developments are sought for technologies that will enable the development of and affordable acquisition of large-scale, complex, software-intensive systems through the development of tools, techniques, standards, and technologies.</p>
<p>Of particular interest are technologies that support architectures for high assurance, trusted/secure architectures, increased computational sophistication, more complex system functionality with improved quality, dramatic improvements in the performance/cost of systems, embedded processing and high productivity computing. Also of interest are technologies that can reduce warfighter decision latencies/response time, decrease system costs and system development times, automate the labor-intensive/error-prone and costly aspects of system software development, improved reliability, longevity, and useability of new and legacy military computing systems.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, and demonstrate computing architecture technologies and applications. This effort will investigate the research, application and/or development of computing architecture technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas: (1) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the processing capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems: This area encompasses all information processing technology both hardware and software that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, scalability and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I processing systems. Examples of hardware technologies include multi-core processing architectures with emphasis on hardware support for semantic operations, power reducing/power management/power aware processing architectures, high assurance/trusted/secure processing architectures, high productivity computing systems, self-aware computing systems, data storage, performance optimization visualization tools, mobile and wireless networks and technologies necessary to achieve exa-scale computing. Examples of software technologies include High Performance Computing (HPC) programming languages both new and existing, data retrieval/mining, data management, data delivery, software/system monitors, publish/subscribe mechanisms, decision making techniques, distributed databases, static and dynamic runtime optimization and resource management. (2) Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS): This area consists of research into the implications of state-of-the-art commercially available processor architectures (including multi-core, GPU's, FPGA's, etc.) and development of solutions for associated security issues to alleviate the impact on the Separation Kernels that are being developed by the real-time operating system vendors for use in environments requiring high assurance. Advance the state of the art through research and development of high assurance middleware technologies for insertion in mission critical embedded systems in order to enhance system interoperability and capability to support cross domain solutions that will enable delivery of superior and timely information to the warfighter. Develop protection profiles according to the Common Criteria for middleware security components in the Multiple Independent Levels of Security/Safety architecture. (3) Software Producibility/Software Intensive Systems: Software is a prime enabler of complex weapons systems and command and control infrastructure, yet it is the least well understood and the most problematic element of large-scale systems. Software project failures dominated by unmet requirements and cost and schedule overruns abound, in large part due to little underlying science, a minimal engineering knowledge base and a lack of understanding of the physics of software. The complexity of today's system lies in greater than 10 to the 5th power requirements, greater than 10 to the 7th power lines of code, thousands or more component interactions, greater than 30 year product life cycles and stringent certification standards. Technologies, methodologies, techniques, and tools to specify, design, build, verify and test software that will enable the development and affordable, timely, and predictable acquisition of complex, software-intensive systems is being sought. Areas of interest include: software and systems composability with guaranteed system interoperability for provably trusted components and systems; model-based development for predictable software attributes with provably correct code generation and automatic software and system analysis; dynamic, scalable and adaptive software debugging; software mechanisms to fully exploit emerging technology, such as multi-core, in producing new software or modernizing legacy systems; mechanisms to fight through software failures; technology that will increase our understanding of software; and the development of an infrastructure for software-intensive systems modeled after the Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification Guideline DO-178B. (4) Formal architectures for the development of verifiably secure systems: This area includes the development of formal, architectural approaches for the design and development of secure systems. The principle research in this area should study powerful, new notions and related formal methods to underlie the approach, including appropriate forms of composition, model transformation, refinement, and general characterizations of security properties. This research must include the demonstration of the feasibility of the approach, and the development of a proof of concept. (5) High Assurance/Trusted Computing Architectures: The objective of this topic is to investigate the necessary building blocks for high assurance computing environments (environments where compelling evidence is supplied to determine a high level of trustworthiness), including both the underlying hardware and software to support it. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: (a) the problems and challenges with current processor designs for trustworthiness and their solutions; (b) the problems and challenges with current computer architectures for trustworthiness and solutions to them; (c) the Operating System level constructs, objects and functions that must be provided to complement the hardware to enable a trustworthy computing base; (d) the state of the art software-based assurance designs, methodologies or concepts which are better suited for implementation in hardware than software. This area is also interested in research and development for increasing the level of trustworthiness of integrated circuit designs, commodity integrated circuits and currently available systems as a whole. Finally, this area is also interested in research in the implications of state-of-the-art commercially available processor architectures (including multi-core, GPUs, FPGAs, etc.) and specially designed processor architectures in support of Separation Kernels and other secure micro-kernels being developed by real-time operating system vendors for use in environments requiring high assurances, develop solutions for such implications, and also research and develop supporting software, e.g. high assurance middleware technologies, in order to enhance system interoperability and capability to support cross domain solutions that will enable delivery of trustworthy, superior and timely information.</p>

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology. The technical concepts should be clearly defined and developed. The technical approach must be sufficiently detailed to support the proposed concepts and technical claims. (2) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, to establish that the offeror has credible capability and experience to complete the proposed work. (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any) to evaluate whether the costs are aligned with the proposed work plan. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>TPOC Name: Christopher Flynn<br />Telephone: (315) 330-3249<br />Email: Christopher.Flynn@rl.af.mil</p>

<DESC>United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Program Office (CPO), Silver Spring, MD., &nbsp;is exploring options for restructuring its climate applications transition program.
<p>This is request for information (RFI) for Information and Planning Purposes Only, and is not a request for proposal.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals; and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a request for proposal or award a contract as a result of this request. This announcement is a request for information only; therefore, a Request for Proposal (RFP) may not be issued against this RFI. The government will not reimburse the respondent for any cost associated with information submitted in response to this request. All information submitted in response to this RFI is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.</p>
<p>NOAA, CPO is exploring options for restructuring its climate applications transition program. Transition in this case is defined as the transfer of fully mature tools or information products to sustained operations. This RFI seeks input that will guide the program's solicitation for FY2010, as well as the future direction and evolution of the program. Responses to this request for information will help the CPO understand the scope of climate information products that are ready for transition to operations, in addition to the capabilities that exist for transitioning these products to operational endpoints. The CPO also seeks to understand how these products can benefit stakeholders and society as a whole. <br /><br />The CPO seeks information on products and capabilities across sectors (i.e., coastal, water resources, health, energy, etc.). The transition of products across sectors supports the effort to expand NOAA's climate service capabilities by interacting directly with users, while ensuring that information is made available through centralized NOAA portals and data centers. For example, NOAA has already funded the transition of various drought and water resource management information and decision-support products to operational endpoints (i.e., NOAA Regional Climate Centers), in an effort to support the (inter-agency) National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS), while linking products to the associated, centralized U.S. Drought Portal (USDP) (www.drought.gov).</p>
<p>Background<br /><br />Transition Program<br /><br />The overarching objective of the CPO's transition program is to transition fully developed climate tools and products to an operational mode, whereby information is consistently delivered and easily accessible by stakeholders. Solid partnerships between product developers and operational endpoints are essential to the success of these transitions, and all parties are expected to work closely together throughout the entire process. Education and outreach are key components to the transition process. Transitioned products must be marketed appropriately to their intended stakeholders. Partner organizations and extension services are encouraged to be involved in the dissemination of these products. The program may transition climate information products that deal with various timescales, from months to years to long-term climate change. A secondary objective of the program, through collective analysis of the transition projects funded under the program, is to learn how to better accomplish the technology transition process for application and improved risk management. <br /><br />Many of the products transitioned through the program have come out of projects funded under other CPO programs that approach climate applications, both regionally and sectorally. The Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) program researches and addresses complex, climate-sensitive issues at the regional level. The Sectoral Applications Research Program (SARP) explores climate-sensitive issues and applications in key socio-economic sectors. More information about CPO programs may be found at www.climate.noaa.gov.<br /><br />Expanding NOAA's Climate Service Capabilities<br /><br />The transition process is expected to be an important component of the role that NOAA plays nationally in providing climate services. NOAA envisions an enhanced capability for providing essential climate information for more effective decision-making in climate-sensitive regions and sectors. NOAA continues to work with other agencies, including the Department of the Interior, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and others, in maximizing the potential benefits in the provision of climate services. Climate information tools and products that are transitioned to NOAA would support NOAA's effort by providing essential information to decision-makers.</p>
<p>Questions to Address in Response to RFI</p>
<p>1. What climate information products have been developed that could lead to more informed decision-making if operationalized?<br />2. What types of stakeholders would potentially benefit most from these products, and how could these products lead to increased capacity for more informed decision-making?<br />3. Are these products applicable to specific regions? Are they transferrable between regions?<br />4. What are the targeted audiences for these products? Can a lay audience use the products? Are the products targeted toward a more technical audience? Is training required to be able to use the products?<br />5. What capabilities exist for transitioning these products to operations (technological capabilities, etc.) and what obstacles exist to transitioning the products to operations?<br />6. Which entities within NOAA have the most potential for serving as operational endpoints for these products? <br />7. What are the costs associated with the transition of these products to operational endpoints and the education and outreach efforts to support use of the products?<br />8. Provide your firm's capabilities and experience in these areas.</p>
<p>Please limit responses to 5 pages single-spaced, in 12-point font and standard margins on 8.5 by 11 paper.</p>
<p><br />Where to Send Responses, Comments, Questions and Timeframe</p>
<p>Comments, questions, and recommendations may be submitted by mail or e-mail, and should be received by 5:00 p.m. EST, January 14, 2010. Mail responses should be submitted to the following address: Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), ERAD, Attn: Charlene Yaple, 601 East 12th Street Room 1756, Kansas City, MO 64106-2877.

<DESC>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the construction of a Command Control Communication Computers Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Depot Maintenance Facility. The proposed procurement is unrestricted with NAICS code 236220 with a size standard of $33.5M. The construction of the Command Control Communication Computers Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Depot Maintenance Facility will be located at Tobyhanna Army Depot Pennsylvania. The solicitation will be available on or about 18 December 2009 with proposal due on or about 19 January 2010. Estimated cost of the construction will be between $1M and $5M. Construction duration is 360 days.<BR>The requirement will be for the renovation of existing maintenance facilities that will relocate depot maintenance workload from Seal Beach to TYAD. Construction and installation tower is necessary in order to perform operational testing of specific radar systems at Seal Beach; and an existing bay (40,000 sf) within TYAD's maintenance complex requires relatively minor facilitization to permit the set up, repair, and testing of various systems and their associated pedestals. The bay is available for use, but requires selected upgrades to the electrical power, lighting, floor coating, air system, and other characteristics. The facility will also require installation of a crane for efficient material handling of end items and sub-assemblies.<BR>All qualified responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The solicitation will be provided in an electronic format on or around the 18th of December 2009.

Since the Period of performance is set to start in Feb 10 2010, is the solicitation going to be released very soon? Is there an estimated date of release?A: Estimated date is sometime in January2.	Is the incumbent vendor that provides these services currently? Or is this a completely new requirement?A: This is a new requirement.3.	Would we be precluded from bidding/working on other VLER (implementation) if we perform work on this contract? A:  No4.	Can a contractor provide a team to be a coordinator in multiple locations?A:  No.  The requirement is to place a community coordinator in the community and to work in that community full-time.  Trying to work more than one location will not be feasible and will defeat the purpose of having a coordinator in the community.5.	Does the contractor have any participation in supporting the VA in the selection of VLER Health Communities?A:  No.6.	Are there any constraints on teaming?A:  We do not understand the question.7.	Is the Capabilities Statement page limited?A:  No8.	Does the VA require any pricing information at this stage?A:  No9.	Does participating in the Community Coordinator role preclude a contractor from providing services to a potential VLER Health Community?A:  We do not understand the question.DRAFT - PROCUREMENT SENSTIVE

<DESC>Bridge action for the Air Vehicle Engineering Department (AIR 4.3) and the Manned Flight Simulator/Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facilities (AIR 5.4) located at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Patuxent River, MD.

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) to extend the performance period of the existing contract (N00421-04-C-0013) until June 30, 2010.  This effort will involve a maximum of 50 man years of Engineering and Technical Services.  These man years are currently available on the existing contract.

Note:  A sources sought synopsis has been issued in preparation for issuing a competitive solicitation (N68335-09-R-0215) to provide these services in the future.

The Government intends to procure the above services under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302.1 (2) (iii), as a bridge action between the existing contract and the follow-on competitive acquisition, in order to provide continuity of services.  Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling Government requirements.  Reference note 22.  The technical and engineering services are currently provided by SAIC on contract N00421-04-C-0013.  The Period of Performance for this contract was set to end on December 31, 2009 and shall be extended to June 30, 2010 by this action.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal in writing that may be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government to open the requirement to competition based on the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice.
