<DESC><p><strong>The US Navy, Military Sealift Command (MSC), is canvassing industry as to whether potential vendors can provide, either commercially or non-commercially, shipboard mattresses in accordance with the following specification.&nbsp; In terms of a specific size standard, MSC intends to use the following measurements:&nbsp;&nbsp; 76" X 34.75" X 6".&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Interested vendors are encouraged to contact Mr. Robert Zaepfel at 757-417-4444 or <a href="mailto:robert.zaepfel@navy.mil">robert.zaepfel@navy.mil</a> to disclose whether their firm is able to provide the product in accordance with the specification and, if not, advise of the problems in providing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE.</strong></p>
<p>**************************</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>This procedure establishes technical requirements for mattresses to be purchased for use aboard Military Sealift Command vessels. This specification is to be used by any individual with the authority to purchase mattresses on behalf of Ships' Forces. Innerspring mattress requirements derive from COMSCINST 9330.6D, Accommodation Standards for MSC Ships (Table 00-2, Gen Note 2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>This specification is intended for potential vendors in order to detail the technical and regulatory requirements which shall be met when purchasing mattresses.</p>
<p>Mattresses are to be of an innerspring type design; neoprene and other foam block mattresses are not acceptable.</p>
<p>All mattresses purchased are to be in compliance with the following regulations and standards:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><strong>ASTM F1085-03a</strong> - Standard Specification for Mattress and Box Springs for use in Berths of Marine Vessels</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Coast Guard, Department Of Homeland Security, Chapter I, Part 116 - Construction And Arrangement, Subpart D, Fire Protection (<strong>46 CFR 116.405j</strong>)</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Consumer Product Safety Commission Standard for the Flammability (Open Flame) of Mattress Sets (<strong>16 CFR 1633</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful testing meeting standards which exceed the above requirements, will be considered on a case by case basis prior to award.</p>
<p>Complete, passing flammability test reports shall be available for review for each mattress production series proposed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Requirements for record keeping of test results and product labeling shall be IAW the above regulations.</p>
<p>Mattress thickness will be specified in each individual purchase order, but shall not be less than 6 inches.</p>
<p>Length and width of mattresses shall be specified in each purchase order, as the wide variation of berths aboard MSC vessels precludes a standard size be referenced in this specification.</p>
<p>Copies of referenced standards may be obtained from the following sources:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a Request For Information (RFI).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no solicitation available at this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems seeks information and/or proposals from potential sources for a replacement hydraulic cylinder packing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As aircraft land aboard US aircraft carriers, they stop by capturing a cable with their "Tail Hook" and pulling the cable through a hydraulic cylinder based arresting engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This engine transfers the energy from the airplane into the fluid, thus bringing the airplane to a stop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are several hydraulic cylinders within this system that require packing to seal the high pressure fluid within the cylinders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, NAVAIR uses a Chevron style V-ring packing made of neoprene on all engine components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The hydraulic fluid is ethylene glycol based.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the gland is not shimmed properly, there could either be excessive drag on the piston or the gland could leak under pressure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A self energized style of packing may be more reliable in these situations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial component being considered is called the Anchor Damper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The piston rod diameter is 3.872 inches, the packing gland diameter is 5.000 inches and the packing length is 1.80 inches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The maximum stroke of the piston is 192 inches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The maximum speed is 515 inches/sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The peak momentary pressure is 12,500 psi, dropping to 10,000 psi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The event duration is 3 seconds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After each event, the system is reset and made ready for another event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pressure while in this ready condition is 400 psi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When the system undergoes maintenance, the pressure will drop to zero psi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The minimum time between events is 30 seconds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only requirements for any new packing is that it be compatible with the parameters above and seal under pressures from 0 thru 15,000 psi..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>modification to existing components is being considered beyond the possible addition of spacers, if necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Candidate replacements will be technically evaluated and then tested for ease of installation, life cycle and suitability for the intended equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once a candidate is deemed acceptable, there are several other sets of packing, including one that is twenty (20) inches in diameter, that this solution may be acceptable for.</p>
<p>All interested sources with potentially qualifying packaging systems are encouraged to respond to this Request for Information and to identify their devices, the qualifications and production status no later than&nbsp;16 April 2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All information should be UNCLASSIFIED. Information should be forwarded to address indicated below. It is requested that information/samples be submitted NO LATER THAN 16 April 2008 to Ms. Letitia Baker, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (Code 2.5.2.3.1), Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, who may be reached at (732)323-4406.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from this RFI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>this RFI nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. The government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to the RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.</p>

<CONTACT>Crystina R Elkins, Phone (206) 526-6036, Email crystina.r.elkins@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Mammal Laboratory, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, located in Seattle, WA, on a sole source basis with Natural Resources Consultants, Inc.  The Government intends to acquire services indicated below using FAR Part 15.<br /> <br />The National Marine Mammal Laboratory, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, conducts research on a number of marine mammal species that inhabit both U.S. and Russian waters.  These include pinniped species; Steller sea lions, northern fur seals, ring seals, bearded seals, ribbon seals, and harbor seals, as well as cetacean species, humpback whales and killer whales.  The Steller sea lion is listed as threatened (eastern stock) and endangered (western stock) under the U.S. Endangered Species Act,  Steller sea lions range across the North Pacific Ocean rim from Japan to central California.  Biologists from the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) conduct research on this species throughout its range and commonly collaborate with Russian, Japanese, and Canadian researchers on projects jointly funded by their respective governments.  These projects include studies on ecology, physiology, genetics, behavior, and a host of other topics aimed at determining the cause of recent and on-going population declines and ways to enhance recovery.  With regard to Steller sea lions, this work has included investigations of historic abundance along the Russian coast and an exhaustive analysis of Russian fishery-sea lion interactions and subsistence harvest. <br /> <br />The primary objective of this procurement will be to continue past and current work involving the review and evaluation of existing Russian data on fishery management practices in the Russian Far East and their possible impact on Steller sea lion population dynamics. The manuscripts and reports listed are specific to the Steller sea lion population and fishery practices in Russia.  This includes the completion and publication of a manuscript on human related Steller sea lion mortality along the Asian coast, and an in-depth analysis of survival rates of Russian Steller sea lions based on mark-recapture analysis. Those projects and others will include new data yet-to-be collected, the analysis of existing and new data, the writing of annual reports, and professional peer-reviewed publications, and the presentation of work at U.S. and international scientific meetings.</p>
<p>When the Steller sea lion was originally listed as threatened, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) appointed a Recovery Team to help develop a Recovery Plan and to provide guidance on what research and steps NMFS should conduct to facilitate recovery.  One of the recommendations of that Team was that NMFS biologists should assess population dynamics and movement patterns of Steller sea lions in both Alaska and Russia and compare these parameters to management measures invoked by the Soviet and Russian governments.  In 2002 slightly more than &frac14; of the worldwide population of western stock Steller sea lions were counted on Russian territory.  The Steller sea lion recovery team was re-initiated in 2001 and disbanded in 2007.  The May 2007 draft of that plan noted the importance of the Russian segment of the population in recovery and listed a recovery action specifically focusing on the need for cooperative work to assess the status of the Russian segment of the population.  In addition, coordinated conservation efforts and research methods are necessary to examine the interchange of animals and apply appropriate tests based on similar methods.</p>
<p>This procurement also seeks experienced field and logistical assistance with the National Marine Mammal Lab's collaborative research on killer whales, humpback whales, and ice seals in various areas of the Russian Far east.  The individual responsible for this work needs to be fluent in speaking and written Russian and English, familiar with the Russian marine mammal permitting logistics, and able to serve as a cruise leader of marine mammal cruises in Russian waters.  This includes the collection of samples and photographs and when necessary, assisting NMML personnel with the capture and handling of ice seals and sea lions.  Finally as part of these services, the contractor will also be asked to assist in the preparation and coordination of international meetings held in Russia.</p>
<p>The presence of an established relationship with both Russian biologists and Russian government agencies is essential to an efficient collection of information and a transfer of both data and samples via the appropriate permits.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately June 1, 2008.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $6.5 million.  <br />This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. It is the Government' belief that only Natural Resources Consultants, Inc. can provide these services. However, other potential sources with the expertise and required capabilities to provide these services can submit such data discussing the same in duplicate within 10 days from the date of this announcement.  Offerors should include a description of significant collaboration and subcontracting that will be required to provide technically acceptable deliverables. This data must include sufficient information to allow NOAA to evaluate the proposal relative to the above requirements. No cost or pricing data is required.</p>
<p>Responses may be faxed to Crystina Elkins at (206)526-6036 or provided by e-mail to Crystina.R.Elkins@noaa.gov.  THIS NOT A SOLICITATION.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">United States</span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"> Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: </span></p>

<DESC><p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for a General Construction Contractor (GC) to perform construction services for the 'First Impression Improvements of Quincy Court' in Chicago, IL.</p>
<p>The Government has purchased one half block in the Central Business District (CBD) of the City of Chicago adjacent to the Mies van der Rohe designed Federal Center. Quincy court is directly in the middle of the block, east of the E. M. Dirksen U.S. Courthouse and flanked by 230 S. State Street and 220 S. State Street. The result of this construction project will create a portal or entrance way to Quincy Court that will visually identify it as Government property.</p>
<p>The project consist of removing above and below grade site improvements, erection of a steel and formed resin canopy structure, new paving, installation of hardened resign tables and benches, and installation of lighting elements throughout the project area. The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of $1 million to $5 million, with an expected project duration of less than 8 months. Work for this project is expected to begin in June 2008. A qualified contractor will be selected using a best-value source selection procedure, in accordance with Part 15 of the FAR.</p>
<p>Funds are currently not available for this acquisition. This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31 million. Although this procurement is not set aside for small businesses, small firms including women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned and service disabled veteran-owned businesses are strongly encouraged to participate in this project. We strongly encourage the participation of local construction contractors as knowledge of the area could enhance the quality of the project.</p>
<p>Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality contractor team effort. The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will only be available electronically and is anticipated to be available on or about March 25, 2008.</p>
<p>The RFP will not be available on the FedBizOpps website. The RFP can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical data Solution (FedTeDS). FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. Potential offerors must register on the FedTeDS website, www.fedteds.gov to have access to the solicitation. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the RFP and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference will be held on or about April 10, 2008 and notification to the Contract Specialist of proposed attendance will be required. We consider attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive and cost effective proposal and to understanding the total result desired by the Government. Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions and miscalculations in offers. Additional details regarding the pre-proposal conference will be included in the RFP.</p>
<p>The offer due date and time for receipt of proposals will also be included in the RFP. In order to be eligible for award offerors are required to provide electronic representations and certifications at www.bpn.gov/orca and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov/">www.ccr.gov/</a>.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contract Specialist, David Mazzolini at (312) 353-0617.</p>

<DESC><p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for a General Construction Contractor (GC) to perform construction services for the 'First Impression Improvements of Quincy Court' in Chicago, IL.</p>
<p>The Government has purchased one half block in the Central Business District (CBD) of the City of Chicago adjacent to the Mies van der Rohe designed Federal Center. Quincy court is directly in the middle of the block, east of the E. M. Dirksen U.S. Courthouse and flanked by 230 S. State Street and 220 S. State Street. The result of this construction project will create a portal or entrance way to Quincy Court that will visually identify it as Government property.</p>
<p>The project consist of removing above and below grade site improvements, erection of a steel and formed resin canopy structure, new paving, installation of hardened resign tables and benches, and installation of lighting elements throughout the project area. The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of $1 million to $5 million, with an expected project duration of less than 8 months. Work for this project is expected to begin in June 2008. A qualified contractor will be selected using a best-value source selection procedure, in accordance with Part 15 of the FAR.</p>
<p>Funds are currently not available for this acquisition. This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31 million. Although this procurement is not set aside for small businesses, small firms including women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned and service disabled veteran-owned businesses are strongly encouraged to participate in this project. We strongly encourage the participation of local construction contractors as knowledge of the area could enhance the quality of the project.</p>
<p>Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality contractor team effort. The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will only be available electronically and is anticipated to be available on or about March 25, 2008.</p>
<p>The RFP will not be available on the FedBizOpps website. The RFP can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical data Solution (FedTeDS). FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. Potential offerors must register on the FedTeDS website, www.fedteds.gov to have access to the solicitation. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the RFP and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference will be held on or about April 10, 2008 and notification to the Contract Specialist of proposed attendance will be required. We consider attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive and cost effective proposal and to understanding the total result desired by the Government. Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions and miscalculations in offers. Additional details regarding the pre-proposal conference will be included in the RFP.</p>
<p>The offer due date and time for receipt of proposals will also be included in the RFP. In order to be eligible for award offerors are required to provide electronic representations and certifications at www.bpn.gov/orca and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov/">www.ccr.gov/</a>.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contract Specialist, David Mazzolini at (312) 353-0617.</p>
