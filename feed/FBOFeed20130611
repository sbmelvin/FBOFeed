<DESC>This RFI is requesting information on Cyberspace Indications and Warning (I&amp;W) technologies that address the challenge of Air Force needs across all of its core mission functions. Air Force missions across the air, space, and cyber domains are increasingly dependent on cyberspace operations. The Air Force desires to identify technologies that focus on predicting cyberspace adversary/threat development efforts/future operations that could adversely impact the United States (US), US military forces and political and economic interests, or US citizens abroad. This includes forewarning of adversary actions or intentions; the imminence of attack on the US, its overseas forces, or allied nations; hostile reactions to US activities; terrorist attacks; and other similar events. The Air Force seeks to enhance its ability to predict and warn - within operationally relevant timelines - against adversary activity in cyberspace in order to facilitate a proactive network defensive posture and provide for cyberspace resiliency during operations.<br />The Air Force faces three military challenges with respect to Cyberspace I&amp;W: 1) The growing threat, 2) Current AF cyberspace defensive focus, and 3) Integrating an AF cyberspace I&amp;W framework.<br />

<DESC>Synopsis: W15P7T-09-D-M615 Duke V3 <br>  <br> This synopsis is published for informational purposes only.  No response to this posting is required.   <br>  <br> Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) intends to award a contract modification to SRCTec, Inc. 5801 East Taft Road, N. Syracuse, NY13212-3275 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source under IDIQ Contract Number W15P7T-09-D-M615 for the Duke V3 system.  The Duke V3 is a mounted Electronic Counter Measure (ECM) system that utilizes the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) to prevent or inhibit the intended operation of Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIEDs).  The modification will increase the contract's ordering ceiling by an estimated $58.4M and will fully incorporate DUKE V3 primary unit support, inclusive of a Duke Technology Insertion (DTI) effort.  Support includes procurement of services and spares currently on contract.  Services include logistics and engineering support for Duke Systems and spares, to include testing, technical insertion, software updates, depot support, and configuration management.  Spares include items such as GPS/Receive antennas, cables, installation kits, etc.  The DTI portion of the effort includes the procurement of a DTI technical data package (TDP) and up to twenty (20) updated production representative Duke Systems.   <br>  <br> SRCTec is the only source that possesses the required drawings and documentation for the Duke V3 system.  Furthermore, SRCTec, with its knowledge of the Duke V3 System designs and interfaces, is the only source that can provide the required DTI changes along with spare parts that are form, fit and functionally interchangeable with existing system components.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), 4310 Boothby Hill Avenue, APG, MD 21005 intends to issue a solicitation for the Torso Protection (TP) System, a component of the Soldier Protection System (SPS) in support of Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE) of the Program Executive Office (PEO) - Soldier, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060.  The TP System must deliver a torso vest protection (fully scalable from a concealable vest to a full-up tactical vest with integrated load management capability), modular component protection (deltoids, yoke/collar, lower back) and outer pelvic protection system that must provide the same or better fragmentation and hand gun protection at a lighter weight than the current baseline (Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV)).  The modular scalable design does not have to be backward compatible but must allow for insertions of future technologies that support modernization and defeat or mitigate the effects of ballistic, blast, fragmentation, blunt impact, and flame threats seen on the battlefield.  All of the ballistic and non-ballistic test requirements are documented in the Technical Statement of Need (TSN).  The areal density of the ballistic filler for the Torso Vest, Front/Back Pelvic, Deltoid, Collar, and Lower Back Protection subcomponents of the TP component must not exceed 0.95 lb/ft2 at proposal submission, but the areal density shall not exceed 0.85 lb/ft2 to be eligible for a production award at the end of the developmental effort.  The areal density of the ballistic filler for the Center Pelvic and Yoke Protection subcomponents of the TP component shall not exceed 0.36 lb/ft2. <br>  <br> All items being procured under this acquisition are subject to the Buy American Act and Berry Amendment.  <br>  <br> This requirement is a developmental effort for vendors to improve upon their currently produced TP items. The anticipated scope of work includes all procurement and production activities required to manufacture the soft armor and other materials that constitute the TP component.  Contractors must submit the entire TP ensemble and not one or more individual components.  The TP must provide protection as required by the TSN.   The anticipated acquisition approach is a two (2) step, four (4) phased process ultimately resulting in one (1) firm, fixed price award to a Single Responsible Offeror (SRO). Step 1 (includes Phases 1-3) is a competitive acquisition for the award of up to three (3) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) developmental contracts.  Step 2 (Phase 4) will result in an award, to the SRO, of a FFP contract for low-rate initial production (LRIP) quantities and include three (3) optional contract line item numbers (CLINs); two (2) options for Full Rate Production (FRP) quantities and one (1) option for a ten (10) year licensing period. This competitive acquisition is designed for the offerors to achieve the desired weight reduction, scalability, and optimal load management as outlined within the SPS TSN, while maintaining current ballistic requirements.   <br>  <br> Step1 (Developmental Contract) <br> * Phase 1: Solicitation & Pre-Engineering & Manufacturing Development (pre-EMD) <br> * Phase 2: Development Testing One (DT1)  <br> * Phase 3: Development Testing Two (DT2) <br>  <br> Step 2 (Production Contract) <br> * Phase 4: Production; LRIP, FRP, and Licensing  <br>  <br> The Government anticipates full & open competition under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 315990 - Apparel Accessories & Other Apparel Manufacturing.  <br>  <br> The Request for Proposal (RFP) W91CRB-13-R-0042 shall be released on or about 19 June 2013 with all documents, attachments, and amendments posted at the FedBizOpps website located at the following web address: https://www.fbo.gov/. No hard copies of this RFP will be issued.

<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i).

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

<SUBJECT>field emission electron source replacement for a JEOL 7830F Field Emission Scanning Auger Microscope

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), intends to negotiate with JEOL USA, Inc.; Peabody, MA, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1 - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to purchase a field emission electron source replacement for a JEOL 7830F Field Emission Scanning Auger Microscope.
<p>The NIST CNST has a requirement to replace a worn-out field emission electron source on a JEOL Field Emission Scanning Auger Microscope (FESAM). The JEOL 7830F FESAM is the core of a unique electron microscope tool that is used for imaging magnetic nanostructures. The microscope is currently barely useable, and until it is repaired NIST will not be able to measure magnetic materials and devices.</p>
<p>Market research has shown that JEOL USA, Inc. is the sole factory authorized provider and distributor of service and parts for JEOL manufactured instrumentation in the United States. JEOL owns the proprietary rights to the drawings and schematics required to install the replacement. Therefore, JEOL is the only responsible source capable of performing repair services and providing replacement parts for the JEOL 7830F Auger Microprobe.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to JEOL USA, Inc. for this requirement in the 4th quarter of fiscal year 2013.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Eric Bubar at eric.bubar@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted so that they are received at eric.bubar@nist.gov no later than June 26, 2013 at 5:00 pm.</p>

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address</strong><br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions9609 Medical Center Dr RM 1E144, Bethesda, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br /><strong>Description</strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, D-69120 Heidelberg for H. pylori multiplex serology testing.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).<br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $12 million. <br /><br />It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.<br /><br />Helicobacter pylori infection is the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer. The discrepancy between the large number of people infected with H. pylori and the minority of individuals who develop related malignancies is thought to relate to a complex interplay of environmental and host susceptibility factors as well as differing virulence among H. pylori strains.<br /><br />H. pylori is a particularly heterogeneous and highly adaptable bacterium. Virulence can vary greatly from strain to strain, and strains vary greatly in different geographical locations. A number of bacterial virulence factors have been associated with particular gastric pathologies and the severity of these pathologic conditions. Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating toxin (VacA) have long been established factors associated with more severe disease; recent comparative and immunoproteomic studies have suggested additional H. pylori antigens which may be associated with malignant potential.<br /><br />Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) has recently developed a new multiplex serologic assay (based on Luminex fluorescent bead technology) for detecting host antibodies generated against CagA and 14 other H. pylori protein antigens, and has reported data from one cross-sectional study that suggests that some of the other H. pylori proteins may also be significant virulence factors. Finding additional significant virulence factors could be important both for understanding the mechanism of H. pylori - induced carcinogenesis and for better risk-stratification of H. pylori infected individuals.<br /><br />NCI plans to assess the relationship between H. pylori seropositivity in 946 cases and controls from the GEMINI study using both standard ELISA for whole cell H. pylori and a multiplex serology assay. There is existing multiplex serology data for 446 of these cases and controls, while this data is outstanding for 500 cases and controls. There is no prior data on whole cell H. pylori (measured by ELISA) seropositivity for the 946 people, as such, H. pylori whole cell ELISA will be measured for all 946 cases and controls.<br /><br />DKFZ has staff with extensive experience conducting Luminex serological assays, and has designed and optimized the proprietary multiplex Luminex assay for detection of antibodies against 15 H. pylori antigens. Thus, it is THE ONLY SOURCE that can supply the services required in this procurement. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on June 25, 2013. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Erin Breedlove, Contract Specialist at breeerin@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-130073-EB on all correspondence.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.

<CONTACT>Steven Galotti, Contract Specialist, Email steven.galotti@tsa.dhs.gov - Marlene Kratz, Contract Officer, Email marlene.kratz@tsa.dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to solicit industry to provide airport Security Screening Services. Services include comprehensive screening of passengers and personal property at Orlando-Sanford International Airport (SFB), Sanford, FL. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this competition is 561612.
<p>The resulting contract term for SFB will be from the date of award for 12 months with four 12-month option periods. A detailed statement of work will be included in the solicitation. Comments or correspondence must be submitted in accordance with the information/instructions contained in the solicitation posting when it is released. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the Request for Proposal (RFP) and all attachments when posted. Some of the RFP attachments contain Sensitive Security Information (SSI). It is suggested that vendors follow the process below in order to gain approval for access to these documents early on in the process. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the FBO for the release of the solicitation and any amendments that may follow.</p>
<p>TSA intends to hold a pre-proposal conference. A draft Statement of Work is attached as Attachment 1 for reference during the visit. Please monitor the FBO website for further information.</p>
<p>Release of Sensitive Security Information:</p>
<p>A. Background.</p>
<p>Sensitive Security Information (SSI) may be available to offerors in preparing responses to this acquisition. Potential offerors must obtain specific authorization in order to obtain SSI. SSI will not be available or otherwise provided or disclosed to any person not specifically authorized to receive it. SSI provided under this acquisition may only be used to satisfy acquisition requirements.</p>
<p>B. Senior Corporate Official.</p>
<p>Each offeror (and subcontractor/team member) must separately designate in writing to the Contracting Officer a single, corporate official who will serve as the single point of contact for sensitive information. This individual must certify that all appropriate protections will be followed, only authorized individuals will have access to the sensitive information, and that those individuals adequately understand their responsibilities to protect the information. This official must also certify to the Contracting Officer every 60 days that all appropriate protections have been followed, only authorized individuals have access to the sensitive information, and that those individuals with access adequately understand their responsibilities to protect the information. A copy of this certification shall also be emailed to RFP.Access@tsa.dhs.gov. This official will also ensure that the Contracting Officer is notified of staffing changes or circumstances in which individuals no longer need access to the information.</p>
<p>C. Offeror Responsibility.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will review the Excluded Parties List, Dunn and Bradstreet, and the System for Award Management to ensure that the corporate entity would not otherwise be precluded from receiving a contract award. While this review does not replace the responsibility determination required by FAR part 9, it may prohibit offerors from receiving SSI information during the solicitation phase of the acquisition.</p>
<p>D. Criteria for Release.</p>
<p>As part of this acquisition, SSI may only be accessed by individuals which have successfully passed a Security Threat Assessment. This assessment may include a verification of site facility clearance in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP), contractor suitability determination or other federal background investigation, individual security clearance(s), and if required, a criminal history records check (CHRC) and/or a check against terrorism databases.</p>
<p>E. Information Requirements.</p>
<p>Consistent with the criteria release described above, offeror's Senior Corporate Officials must provide the appropriate information to the TSA as identified below. This requirement applies to any prospective subcontractor, joint venture partner, or "team" company whose access to the specified SSI and consequent input into the planned proposal is necessary to prepare and complete the proposal. All information must be emailed to RFP.Access@tsa.dhs.gov with a carbon copy to Steven Galotti at Steven.Galotti@tsa.dhs.gov no later than 7/11/2013. TSA will not guarantee delivery of SSI to companies that submit their requests after 7/11/2013.</p>
<p>(1) Senior Corporate Officials shall provide the Contracting Officer via email with the CAGE code of the offeror's facility that will manage the proposal, company DUNS number, and address; and</p>
<p>(2) Senior Corporate Officials shall provide the following information for all employees who require access to SSI in a single password protected Microsoft Excel spreadsheet emailed to the Contracting Officer. The password for the password protected spreadsheet shall be sent to the Contracting Officer in a separate email, at the same time.</p>
<p>&bull; Employee Full Name:<br />&bull; Employee Gender: (i.e., Male or Female)<br />&bull; Employee Birth Date: <br />&bull; Employee Citizenship:<br />&bull; Social Security Number:<br />&bull; Indication of whether any nominated employees have:<br />&bull; Previously received a TSA suitability determination;<br />&bull; Undergone a federal background investigation; or<br />&bull; Possess an individual security clearance</p>
<p>F. Privacy Act Statement.</p>
<p>TSA will use the information provided to conduct a security threat assessment on individuals who seek access to Sensitive Security Information (SSI). The information will be shared within DHS with personnel who need the information to perform their official duties. Additionally, DHS may share the information with law enforcement, intelligence, or other government agencies as necessary to identify and respond to potential or actual threats to transportation security in accordance with the routine uses identified in the applicable Privacy Act system of records notice (SORN), DHS/TSA 002, Transportation Security Threat Assessment System (T-STAS). This SORN was last published in the Federal Register on November 8, 2005, and can be found at 70 FR 67731- 67735. Authority: 49 USC 114. Furnishing this information is voluntary. However, failure to furnish the requested information may delay or prevent the completion of your security threat assessment, without which you may not be granted access to the SSI.</p>
<p>G. Notification of Assessment.</p>
<p>If it is determined that covered individuals are not eligible to receive access to particular SSI based on the threat assessment, TSA will provide the individuals and company point of contact a written determination that provides notification that the individual does not qualify to receive SSI. Appeal of the determination will not be permitted due to the time sensitive nature of the acquisition process, however, the potential offeror may nominate another individual to receive SSI access. In the event that an individual is determined to be a security threat and the individual believes that the results of the screening are inaccurate, he or she will be informed by TSA on how to pursue redress from TSA, however due to the demanding acquisition schedule, TSA will not delay an acquisition to resolve redress issues.</p>
<p>H. Non-Disclosure Agreements.</p>
<p>Each offeror employee requesting access to SSI as specified herein will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (DHS Form 11000-6). The executed forms shall be provided with and as part of the submission of information reflected in Paragraph E above. The Offeror should understand that employees granted access to SSI and signing a non-disclosure agreement are bound by the terms of that agreement indefinitely, notwithstanding their employment status or any other background checks or clearances granted by any Government agency.</p>
<p>Return of SSI. Any SSI provided to the offeror must be returned to the Government and verified by the Government prior to the beginning of proposal evaluations. Any offeror not returning SSI provided directly to them will be subject to penalties as prescribed by law and otherwise rendered ineligible for further consideration in the evaluation.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION ONLY:  THIS SYNOPSIS IS ONLY A NOTIFICATION THAT A SOLICITATION IS ANTICIPATED AND FORTHCOMING.   <br>  <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District (CESWL), has been tasked to solicit for and award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Design-Build Construction and Initial Outfitting Services (DBIO) in support of the United States Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) Healthcare Facilities Modernization Program throughout CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii, and other customers within Southwestern Division (CESWD) boundaries that may have healthcare facility needs. <br>  <br> The Air Force Medical Service Agency is responsible for managing the programming, planning, design, construction, outfitting, and sustainment for the Air Force Surgeon General's health facility program.  AFMSA/Health Facilities Division (AFMSA/HFD) relies on the support of CESWL to execute this program. A means to manage this program is via the integrated Design-Build-Initial Outfitting (DBIO) IDIQ MATOC.  The DBIO MATOC allows the program to retain a pool of highly qualified and experienced designers-builders-outfitters to execute its five-year program. This contract requires the contractor to fully integrate design, construction, and outfitting processes under one contract and employ integrated cradle-to-grave project delivery. These IDIQ MATOC contracts will support the execution of AFMSA's FY13-FY17 Healthcare Facilities Modernization Program.  <br>  <br> Under this contract, contractors shall provide all necessary labor, material, supervision, and equipment to design, construct, and outfit new or newly renovated medical facilities.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for dredging of NYNJ Harbor Shoal Removal (S-SR-2) Contract #2 for New York and NEW Jersey Harbor and Adjacent Channels. The project area is located in NYNJ Channels in New York and New Jersey. The Contract consists of deepening of the Federal Navigation Channel System (Removal of Shoals) to a depth of -52, -50 and -47 feet (plus 1.0 for dredge tolerance) (MLW) in different locations in the Port of New York and New Jersey. The project S-SR-2 includes the dredging and placement of non-rock materials. The non-rock materials suitable for Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS) placement will be placed at the HARS Site.  The non-rock materials un-suitable for HARS placement will be placed Upland at the Contractor's approved selected site(s).  The contract will involve the use of an environmental bucket such as a cable-arm clamshell dredge with 26 cubic yard bucket, an excavator dredge with a 12 CY bucket or a regular clamshell. These dredges must be able to operate in a minimum of 54 ft of water. Scows and tugs will be needed to place the material at the HARS and Upland.  In addition, the Contractor must be capable of working in an active navigation channel with frequent ship traffic. The Contractor will therefore be required to relocate to allow for passage into the harbor and ports.  Dredgers must be able to handle material at a sufficient rate to maintain a very aggressive schedule. In addition, the presence of dredging equipment in the channel will impact ship traffic, and it is necessary to minimize the duration of this impact.  The duration of this project is approximately 200 calendar days for the base plus optional items.  The work is estimated to cost between $45,000,000 and $55,000,000.   <br>  <br> This procurement is being solicited as UNRESTRICTED.  The applicable NAICS code is 237990 (with a Small Business Size Standard of $20,000,000.00).  The SIC Code is 1629.   <br>  <br> Plans and specifications for the subject project will be available on or about 26 June 2013. Bid opening is scheduled for on or about 29 July 2013 at 2:00 P.M. in Room 1841 at 26 Federal Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10278-0090. <br>  <br> Large business concerns must submit as part of their bid a subcontracting plan for this project in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-8 and FAR Clause 52.219-9. Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan may make the bidder ineligible for award of the contract. Small Business Goals: If a large business, the prime contractor shall provide its small business subcontracting plan conforming to the requirements of FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.7. The small business subcontracting goals for USACE New York District are as follows: Small Business 50.0%, Small Disadvantaged Business 17.0%, Women-Owned Small Business 18.0%, HubZone Small Business 10.0%, Veteran Owned Small Business 4.0% and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 4.0%.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements to provide machining and coating services in accordance with the drawing packages provided by 96 TSS, Eglin AFB FL. All drawings are considered Scientific and Technical Information (STINFO) Distribution D and the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, USC, Sec 2751, et seq) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended . Thus the requirements can only be released to US DoD contractors and subcontractors. In order to be considered a DoD contractor or subcontractor, the contactor or subcontractor must currently be the holder of an active DoD contract. Drawings shall be provided to the contractor at the time of order and are provided in Solid Works Format. In most cases, the tolerances are such that Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machines are required. Coatings include nickel plating, powder coating, and painting as specified on the design drawings. Typically, the fixtures and enclosures shall be fabricated from aluminum, steel, and plastic as specified on the design drawings.<br />The Air Force anticipates utilizing a Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Air Force anticipates the ordering period will be a base year and four (4) option years. Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. DoD firms responding to this announcement shall indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 339999, size standard 500 employees. All prospective DoD contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their CCR. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. <br />All interested contractors shall submit a capabilities document not to exceed 8 pages. Provide recent, relevant experience in all areas, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Recency is considered within the last three calendar years. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements shall be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements: (1) the company has the technical knowledge and manufacturing capability to produce components according to description above, and (2) spare components delivered will meet form, fit, and performance requirements for physical and functional compatibility with provided drawings. Additionally, since the drawings are subject to the Arms Export Control Act please include a list of subcontractors that may be utilized in the performance of this contract. Please Include the following in your statement of capabilities: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; current DoD contract number or numbers; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to AFTC/PZIE (Eglin), Ms. June Crockett,june.crockett@eglin.af.mil no later than June 26, 2013 (date) at 1pm Central Time. <br />The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.<br />If you have any questions, you may contact Ms. June Crockett, Contracting Specialist, at June.Crockett@eglin.af.mil or Ms. Karen Wagner, Contracting Officer, at Karen.Wagner@eglin.af.mil

<DESC> <br> THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUEST ONLY, IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL STUDY. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking Offerors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests. No solicitation document exists at this time, and requests for a solicitation will not be answered. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) and Defense Logistic Agency - Energy (DLA-E) are conducting a market survey to identify potential sources of cetane improvers for use in jet fuel.  The cetane number of jet fuel is critical for the Army's fleet of Ground Vehicles and Ground Support Equipment.  Information on products in development that could be used as a cetane improver additive would be welcome; however, the addition of other fuels to enhance cetane should not to be included.  The intent of the market survey is to identify sources of supply for cetane improvers.  These sources may offer products that are either commercially available or under development.   <br>  <br> Companies or organizations capable of providing cetane improvers are asked to respond to this market survey by providing answers to the following questions. <br>    <br> MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONS: <br>  <br> Part I. Business Information: <br>  <br> 1. Company/Institute Name: <br> 2. Type and Size of Business: <br> 3. Manufacturer or Marketer: <br> 4. CAGE Code <br> 5. Company Point of Contact: <br>    a. Name <br>    b. Telephone <br>    c. Email address: <br> 6. Physical Address: <br> 7. Web page URL:  <br> 8. Approved ISO Certifications <br>  <br> Part II.  Cetane Improver Survey Questions: <br> 1.  Cetane Improver/Product Name <br> 2.  List all of the components of the cetane improver.   <br> 3.  Can the mechanism on how the additive improves the cetane number of the fuel be explained?  If yes, please provide rationale. <br> 4.  Are any of the components hazardous/toxic? If so, please provide explanation and toxicity information.   <br> 5.  What is the suggested treat rate for the product and what is the expected cetane number increase?   <br> 6.  Has any testing been conducted to determine if the treat rate could be lowered but still achieve similar results?  If yes, by what concentration could the cetane improver be reduced? <br> 7.  Does the cetane improver offer any other benefit to the fuel system? <br> 8.  Could addition of the cetane improver cause any negative impacts on the fuel system or other fuel properties?  If yes, please describe the negative impacts. <br> 9.  Would the cetane improver be stable and remain suspended in the fuel over the entire military operational temperature range (-40 F to 180 C)? If not, please explain the limitations of the cetane improver. <br> 10. Will the solubility of the cetane improver change over time and in different temperatures?  If yes, please explain. <br> 11. When added to the fuel, is there a preferred method for mixing? <br> 12. What would be needed in order to blend in a field location (non-refinery)? <br> 13. If fuel is stored (with the cetane improver), will the cetane improver degrade over time? If yes, how would this affect fuel operability? <br> 14. Is this additive used commercially?  If yes, who are the users of this product and what are the suggested treatment rates for this application?   <br> 15. Has the military ever bought the product?  If so, provide details (identify the buying organization(s) and the date(s) of prior purchases.  Provide contract numbers if available). <br> 16. Has any cetane engine testing or other ASTM-certified methods (i.e, ASTM D6890, ASTM D7170 or ASTM D7668) been conducted on this product in jet fuel?  In diesel fuel? If so, how much improvement was recorded and at what concentration?   <br> 17. Could there be interaction between the cetane improver and military jet fuel additives?  The military jet fuel additives are corrosion inhibitor/lubricity improver (CI/LI), fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII), and static dissipater additive (SDA).  Could there be any negative effects from this interaction on the fuel system? <br> 18. In addition to lab based cetane testing, has any other type of lab or engine dynamometer testing been conducted?  If yes, please identify the test methods and results.  <br> 19. If the additive is in the research stage(s), how much data/information is available at this time?  Can the testing be shared with TARDEC?  Please provide explanation.    <br> 20. What is the cost of the product if purchased in the following quantities: 1 ounce, 1 pint, and 1 gallon? <br> 21. Where is the product manufactured? <br> 22. If the product is manufactured outside of the US, can it be shipped to the United States for testing? <br> 23. If the product is manufactured in the US, can the product be shipped overseas? <br> 24. How is the product packaged?  What type of containers and in what sizes? <br> 25. Provide Safety Data Sheet (SDS), if available. <br> 26.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />FOR<br />MANAGED SERVICES CONTRACT INVOLVING<br />GOVERNMENT OWNED<br />PHARMACEUTICAL, MEDICAL SUPPLIES, AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT
<p><br />PURPOSE:</p>
<p>GSA FEDSIM is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) as market research, to obtain industry comments about the anticipated structure of the final RFP as described below:</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Government has the mission to deliver critical medical assets to the site of a national emergency (e.g., man-made disaster, flu outbreak, earthquake, etc.). The Government manages a national repository of antibiotics, chemical antidotes, antitoxins, life-support medications, and medical supplies that can be used to supplement state and local resources during a large-scale public health emergency. GSA FEDSIM intends to solicit for Contractor support on the Open Market using FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition, for the storage of Government-owned pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and medical equipment in accordance with the attached draft Request for Proposal (RFP). The Contractor shall provide all necessary expertise, labor, materials, and space to safely and securely, receive, store, stage, and transport these items.</p>
<p>The Government requires the managed site as follows:</p>
<p>1. Will be located within 20 driving miles of the International Airport for Site B (location will be provided only after a NDA is signed). The Contractor shall manage approximately 50 tons of Government-provided containerized medical supplies (130 containers) and up to 225 pallets of product.</p>
<p>2. The Government anticipates that the final RFP will be for a total period of 5 years. This 5 year period will be structured as a base period of 1 year with 4 one year optional periods. No payment for the facility conditioning will be provided to the Contractor until the facility satisfactorily meets all the requirements as stated in the RFP. The monthly Managed Service Charges will include all costs associated with establishing and maintaining a compliant facility, receiving, managing inventory and all Contractor provided transportation. In light of this, the following information is being requested</p>
<p>a. Please note that the final RFP may require that the facility be compliant and ready no later than 90 days after contract award. What concerns, if any, do you have regarding this timeline and that payment will not be provided until the Government accepts of the facility?</p>
<p>3. The final RFP will require the offeror at time of proposal submission to provide not only the documented commitment from the building owner that the proposed facility will be available for use under this contract if it is awarded, but additionally that the owner has agreed to all the facility modifications required. Failure to provide this information at time of proposal submission would cause the proposal to be found non-responsive and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>b. As a potential offeror, do you have any concerns as to your ability to secure sufficient space in the required area to support a 5 year contract with a 1 year base and 4 optional years?</p>
<p>4. As stated in the draft RFP, the Government plans to require that the proposed facility is not located within &frac14; mile from any hazardous material (excluding those dedicated to airport operations).</p>
<p>c. As a potential offeror, do you have any concerns regarding this criterion?</p>
<p>5. The Government plans to require the Contractor to provide staff and equipment such that they can respond quickly to an emergency at any time, night or day, and transport stored materials either to the airport or over roads to other locations within strict time limits (details are in the attached draft RFP).</p>
<p>d. As a potential offeror, do you have any concerns as to your ability to staff and equip a facility so as to ensure transportation of stored materials is delivered within the allotted time limits?</p>
<p>6. Please provide any questions or other concerns you may have on the attached draft RFP.</p>
<p>RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>The location of this requirement (Site B) is sensitive information. To receive the location, all interested offerors are required to submit a signed corporate Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) (Attachment D of the draft RFP). Upon receipt of the executed NDA, the Government will send details regarding the location. The NDA should be sent to the FEDSIM Contract Specialist, Millicent Hawkins (millicent.hawkins@gsa.gov).</p>
<p>All firms expressing an interest in responding to this requirement shall provide the following information:</p>
<p>a. Name and Address of Firm.<br />b. Point of Contact information (Name, Phone Number, email address)<br />c. A brief description of your responses to the above questions/issues and your level of interest and ability to submit a proposal involving the site in light of the attached draft RFP requirements.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not considered quotes and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government or the Contractor to submit a quote. The Government will not pay for the information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any Government assessments. No awards will be issued as a result of this RFI. However, the information received through this RFI will be used to assist in acquisition planning for this procurement.</p>
<p>The final solicitation, when available, will be posted on FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov). It will be the Contractor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for the release of the final RFP and any applicable amendments.</p>
<p>All responses to this RFI shall be provided to the FEDSIM Contracting Officer, Derrick White, and the FEDSIM Contract Specialist, Millicent Hawkins, via email at Derrick.white@gsa.gov and millicent.hawkins@gsa.gov respectively. <strong>Responses are due no later than 3:00 PM EST, on Friday, June 21, 2013</strong>.</p>

<DESC>Statement of Work (SOW)<br />Provision of Online Training Courseware and Materials
<p>Background<br />The US Department of State's Foreign Service Institute (FSI) is the bureau of record responsible for providing training opportunities in support of the Institute's mission. While the Institute supplies substantial coursework through its classroom offerings, it is impossible to meet the training needs of a worldwide population on-demand. Therefore, the Institute seeks to augment its classroom training with general online content as well as an additional virtual resource of textual materials, delivered via the Internet.</p>
<p>Under the Human Resources Line of Business (HR LOB) overseeing Human Resources Development (HRD), FSI has been designated as the preferred eLearning content provider for agencies requiring training content for the foreign affairs community. USAID is one such federal agency making use of these services in their solicitation for commercially-produced online training products.</p>
<p>Scope<br />The principal goal is to extend FSI's and USAID's reach by providing general online content which is to be used both within already-established training curricula as well as a supplement to each agency's custom online courses, in order to reach its extensive audience. It is not expected to in any way replace existing training offered by either agency.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />The primary objective is to provide contractor services and deliverables through the provision of general online content courseware (both FSI and USAID) and a set of virtual resources (USAID only) delivered via each agency's in-house learning management system. Such content offers training and study opportunities to employees whom, for financial and logistical reasons, may not be able to avail themselves of residential training at the Institute. In addition, it supports the provision of both industry-standard IT certifications, as well as professional certifications (see Appendix A).</p>
<p>Tasks<br />The Foreign Service Institute is in search of a training vendor to provide off-the-shelf online training content (for both agencies), as well as a library of virtual text materials (USAID only). The course collection should be fairly extensive, covering a breadth of topics including but not limited to: accounting, administrative skills, communication, customer service, economics, environmental, finance, health, information technology (desktop and systems), leadership, management, safety, et al. The courses must run seamlessly on the Institute's established learning management system, Learn.com "LearnCenter 9.3," a commercial off-the-shelf product, of which FSI owns the code. To that end, the course content should be SCORMed and 508-compliant. The text library should support IT systems run by USAID (e.g., Microsoft Office 2010 Suite (i.e., Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Office, Outlook, Project, Visio), Adobe Connect, Security+, Exchange, Server et al).

<DESC>1.0 Purpose
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as outlined in FAR 15.201(c) (7). The purpose of this RFI is to accomplish market research pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, and to identify businesses capable of performing the functions described herein.  The government is requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of attracting new service providers to support the requirements of the Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), Office of Security Technology (ST), as described in this RFI. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment on the part of the government to conduct a solicitation for the below-listed services in the future. Responders are advised that the government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, nor will it compensate responders for any costs incurred in the development/furnishing of a response. The government will not entertain telephone calls or questions for this RFI.</p>
<p>Please note that a decision not to submit a response to this RFI will not preclude a vendor from participating in any future solicitation.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>DS is the law enforcement and security arm of the DOS.  DS is responsible for providing a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.  All Foreign Service posts (embassies, consulates-general, consulates, et al.) operate with technical and physical security programs designed and maintained by DS.  In the Department of State's 270 overseas Foreign Service posts, ST has the key role in ensuring overseas technical and physical security systems are installed, maintained, repaired, upgraded, and monitored.<br />Many DOS posts are under continual threat from small arms fire, and it is the intention of the Department to implement a system to detect and warn if such incidents occur.  Life safety for DOS personnel is of premier importance, and such a system would increase the security of those living and working within the post compound.  A small arms detection system will provide an audible warning of attack to compound personnel, allowing them to take immediate cover or move away from the most dangerous areas.  In addition, when the system provides the location of the shooter, local authorities can be notified and respond appropriately, and forensic analysis can be done after the incident.  In most cases, the operator of this system would be a Marine Security Guard (MSG) located in &lsquo;Post 1', which is control station for most of the compound's security systems.<br /><br />ST is seeking a commercially available solution for compound-wide detection and warning of small arms fire, including rifle, rocket propelled grenades (RPGs), and rockets.  The system provided should be able to integrate into the current security condition at DOS installations, including physical and electronic hardware as well as security procedures already in place.  Because of the diplomatic mission of DOS, the implementation of any system should be as unobtrusive as possible so as not to project an image of military preparedness.</p>
<p>3.0 Prerequisites</p>
<p>At this time, there is no requirement for a facility security clearance or cleared staff under the National Industrial Security Program.  However, if a respondent participates in the National Industrial Security Program and has facility and personnel clearances, please provide that information in the response.</p>
<p>4.0 Requirements</p>
<p>1. Provide immediate detection and location of direct fire systems ranging from a single gunshot round (.223 to .50 caliber) up to an RPG or small rocket (107mm).<br />2. The system should not require a full-time operator or maintainer for daily operation.<br />3. The solution cannot use purely acoustic means of detection.<br />4. The system should be able to classify the incoming fire according to its type (i.e. small rifle, large rifle, RPG, rocket).<br />5. Disseminate alerts to guard staff personnel via audible and visual (display on a map) means, in order to move personnel to a safe area of the compound. A system to produce the audible warning is not required, only the ability to trigger an installed alert system.<br />6. The system should provide a general location (azimuth/elevation/range or point on map) of the shooter.<br />7. The solution should have the capability to add/control pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) and CCTV video cameras which are currently in use at DOS installations.<br />8. The system should try to minimize its physical footprint, be discreet in appearance, and disguised, if possible.<br />9. Information will be sent to Post 1 or other operations center over an IP network, which is open, but may contain encrypted data.  This will provide the ability to integrate with other systems in the future.<br />10. The system should provide information to, and be able to be controlled from, multiple places such as Post 1, an operations center, or a safe haven. <br />11. The system should be able to create or provide data (round classification, shooter position, number of rounds, etc.) for post-incident forensic reports.<br />12. Delivery of the system must be expeditious and leverage existing DOS installation protection efforts. Please provide information detailing an estimated delivery schedule to include any implementation processes affecting schedule.</p>
<p>4.1 Environment</p>
<p>The environment consists of a compound, which could include one or more buildings.  The buildings may vary in length, width, number of floors and shape.  The compound is fenced and has existing protection assets.  The compound is typically in an urban environment that is complex and asymmetric.  The environment is busy with friendly, neutral and enemy personnel and vehicle traffic on some or all of the sides of the compound on a 24/7 basis, but perhaps busier during business hours.  Vehicle and personnel access to the compound is restricted and screened. From 20-100+ personnel could be in the compound at any given time including known personnel, and visitors or temporary personnel under the control of DOS personnel.  Due to potential locations in developing countries, consistent and clean power may not be continuously available.  The electromagnetic environment is complex involving commercial frequencies, friendly DOS frequencies, threat frequencies, and sniffers as well as typical clutter.  The exterior of the compound is monitored by a variety of cameras which include fixed, PTZ, low-light, and infrared (potentially with infrared spotlights).  There is not an integrated command and control system for the cameras; they are monitored and controlled by the MSGs at Post 1.  Manpower is limited, so increasing the number of operators is not an option.</p>
<p>5.0 Summary of Requirements<br /><br />Diplomatic Security is seeking a Small Arms Detection (SAD) system solution for implementation in an urban environment for compound protection in locations around the world.  A purely acoustic system is not desired due to the inherent difficulties of an urban environment.  The SAD system must be able to provide a minimum amount of information regarding the location of a shooter, including but not limited to azimuth, elevation, and distance in relation to the compound.  The precision of locating the shooter's position is a significant factor in the judged efficacy of the solution, and the ability to display that position on a map (such as Google Earth) is preferred.  The system must be able to detect both single and multiple round fire from firearms (5.56mm and larger), RPGs and low elevation rockets (107mm e.g.).  Detection of high altitude indirect fire (IDF) is not a requirement.  The system must be able to classify the incoming fire as Small Rifle, Large Rifle, RPG, or Rocket.  The system should be able to integrate with existing DS security systems, including cameras (to provide shooter information) and audiovisual alarms (to provide compound-wide warning).  There is potential for the solution to be implemented at a location that is protected by a DS Sense &amp; Warn IDF detecting radar system, and it is desired that the SAD system will be integrated with that Command and Control software.  This would allow the SAD system to be controlled from an operations center other than Post 1.  The solution should have enough flexibility to be able to adapt to the unique aspects of each compound in order to provide optimal coverage.  The implementation of the SAD solution should not require additional staffing for daily operation, but there is potential for an on-site Field Service Representative for maintenance.  Operational software which is included with the system must be able to provide information for a post-incident forensics report<br />Instructions</p>

<p>Please note that a decision not to submit a response to this RFI will not preclude a vendor from participating in any future solicitation.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>DS is the law enforcement and security arm of the DOS.  DS is responsible for providing a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.  All Foreign Service posts (embassies, consulates-general, consulates, et al.) operate with technical and physical security programs designed and maintained by DS.  ST has the key role in ensuring overseas technical and physical security systems are installed, maintained, repaired, upgraded, and monitored.  Monitoring of technical security systems is done both locally and through an advanced, global, remote monitoring and control system and network, named the Security Management System enterprise (SMSe).<br />SMSe is the worldwide integration of selected technical security systems, with data availability to DS staff at post and to remote DS monitoring centers, for the purpose of better protecting people, information, facilities, and operations.  <br />SMSe provides real-time and historic data by integrating technical security sub-systems at Foreign Service posts, then connecting posts and monitoring centers via the SMSe Network (SMSeNet).  SMSe data is available to Regional Security Officers (RSO), Security Engineering Officers (SEO) and Marine Security Guards (MSG), regional Engineering Service Center (ESC) staff, the DS Command Center (DSCC), and to the SMSe Network Operations Center (NOC).  <br /><br />ST is seeking a commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) solution for aggregating, parsing, analyzing, and displaying security data from various systems related to automated access control, intrusion detection, imminent danger notification, and digital video recording.  This solution should display data logically and utilize geospatially correct 3-D digital models, of designated foreign sites, to assist with security environment situational awareness.</p>
<p>3.0 Requirements</p>
<p>3.1 General Requirements</p>
<p>DS is interested in exploring the various COTS Physical Security Information Management (PSIM) systems in the marketplace, particularly those capable of ingesting data from various security subsystems.  The PSIM should further integrate interactive 3-D models with interactive icons to enhance situational awareness.  Compatibility with Google Earth for all geospatial information is highly desired.  The solution should provide a foundation for future capacity and capability to allow for the integration of custom connectors for integration of new technology or data sources.  The PSIM systems must be able to acquire, parse, analyze, and display data in such a manner that all monitoring personnel can quickly determine the urgency of any reported situation.</p>
<p>3.2 Environment</p>
<p>The PSIM servers will be provisioned on government-owned hardware.  Components such as web servers, messaging servers and database engines shall be COTS products, NIST-certified and text-based, where possible.  The ability of the application to utilize FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing and signing for communication, is an important factor.  The system must communicate with PSIM clients on an IP-based intranet.  Network bandwidth for remote sites is extremely variable and selected remote sites should be capable of standing alone during any network outage.  Operations at remote sites should remain stable during interruptions in connectivity to the Wide Area Network (WAN) and should have buffering and synchronization capabilities, such that all relevant sites are updated and return to normal operations upon WAN reinstatement.  Network latency to remote sites of up to 600ms should be expected and cause no inherent problem in the method by which data are displayed to on-site personnel or to associated remote monitoring stations.  The solution should be able to leverage Active Directory for authentication and role assignment purposes, operate in an environment utilizing a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, be configurable for high availability to include application redundancy, and be capable of operating in IPv4 and IPv6 environments.</p>
<p>3.3 Hardware</p>
<p>The PSIM shall have a proven ability to integrate inputs from the following list of equipment, such that automated analytical functions can be applied to display actual event information in the appropriate manner.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
OneVA Pharmacy

1.  PURPOSE:  

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Solicitation, a Request for Quote, or an indication that the Government will award a contract for the items contained in this RFI.  This notice is not be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested, or reimburse expenses incurred for responses to this RFI.  

The Government is seeking all business types that have the capability or capacity to provide the items and services identified below.  Responses to this notice will assist the Government in determining a socioeconomic strategy for a potentially forthcoming Request for Proposal.  

2.  ANTICIPATED SCOPE OF WORK:

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Grassroots Innovations Program is a cooperative effort between the Chief Technology Officer, the Health and Medical Informatics Office, and VA's Office of Information and Technology to catalyze and support VA's next generation of Health Information Technology Innovation.  The Innovations Program provides VA employees (innovators) with a mechanism to propose new opportunities and to develop these ideas into functional prototypes.

There are two separate phases to the Innovations Program.  The low bar phase is a proof of concept phase and all work will be accomplished outside of the VA's network in a VA virtual testing environment (Innovations Sandbox). This proof of concept/prototype shall have scalability to a full development version.  The high bar phase occurs when a concept is moved to a developmental/production environment after the proof of concept has been developed, tested, and approved for full scale development.  The Veterans Health Administration has a requirement for OneVA Pharmacy because Veterans travelling across the United States are currently unable to obtain an active VA prescription refill on-site at any VA pharmacy.  In the community, this is a standard of practice.  Example:  A prescription with active refills processed at any Walgreens pharmacy can be refilled at any other Walgreens pharmacy nation-wide.  The goal is to expand currently available pharmacy information in Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) to provide pharmacists direct access to any active, refillable prescription from any VA Healthcare System.  

This project falls within the low bar parameters and will be performed solely within the Innovations Sandbox to determine if a full-scale prototype can be achieved for regional and/or national implementation.  The purpose of this project is to forecast if all VA pharmacists would be end-users of a successful project.

The Contractor shall provide a software development prototype which will modify existing VistA software to allow pharmacies at OneVA locations to make changes and address prescriptions.  The Contractor shall provide documentation, testing, training, and technical support for the prototype.  

See attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for additional information and anticipated requirements.
  
3.  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:

It is requested that any interested and qualified company submit the information required below via email to the point of contact listed at this bottom of this announcement.  
Interested companies shall provide the following information:

    - Company Name;
    - CAGE/DUNS Number under which the company is registered in SAM.gov
    - Company Address;
    - Point of contact name;
    - Telephone number;
    - Email address;
    - Company's business size, including applicable North American Industry
      Classification System (NAICS) code(s); and
    - Capability Statement (10 page limit)

The capability statement for this requirement is not to exceed 10 pages (including any attachments).  It should clearly detail the firm's ability to perform the aspects of the requirement described in the PWS.

Specifically, the Government requests that capability statements demonstrate:

a)	The ability to perform based on relevant examples of similar performance or involvement with similar contracts or projects, such as software development efforts and VistA modifications

b)	A brief explanation of a potential technical approach to tasks listed in PWS paragraph 5.2, specifically Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2

4. RESPONSES DUE:  

Please submit the above requested information by 3:00PM EST on June 25, via email to Elisa Coluccio, Contract Specialist, Elisa.Coluccio@va.gov.

This request for information, or Sources Sought notice, shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal.   Information is to be provided on a voluntary basis.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges including postage and shipping will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-1853<br />Name:		Cover, Certificate-Document, Gold Foil Stamped, Green<br />Description:	Green certificate-document cover with gold foil stamped front cover. Certificate-document cover is from a die-cut design and can hold an 8-1/2 x 11", 8" x 10" or an A4-size award or document. Made with 80-lb. linen stock paper. UOI is PG. PG = 5</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-9910<br />Name:		Cover, Certificate-Document, Gold Foil Stamped, Burgundy<br />Description:	Burgundy certificate-document cover with gold foil stamped front cover. Certificate-document cover is from a die-cut design and can hold an 8-1/2 x 11", 8" x 10" or an A4-size award or document. Made with 80-lb. linen stock paper. UOI is PG. PG = 5</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-9917<br />Name:		Cover, Certificate-Document, Gold Foil Stamped, Red<br />Description:	Red certificate-document cover with gold foil stamped front cover. Certificate-document cover is from a die-cut design and can hold an 8-1/2 x 11", 8" x 10" or an A4-size award or document. Made with 80-lb. linen stock paper. UOI is PG. PG = 5</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-1853<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	GEO 47399</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-9910<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	GEO 45333</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-9917<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 25, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>The National Forests in Alabama intend to issue a sole source purchase order to IronWolf Manufacturing, LLC of Noble, OK for two-to-four week rental of an IronWolf Rock Crusher with 8-ft wide head mounted on a Cat 950G Wheel Loader, including delivery to and return from Alabama and instruction to the local operators. The purpose of this rental is to provide equipment for a contractor to perform for refurbishment of Forest Service roads on the Talladega National Forest. The equipment must be capable of crushing roadbed rock up to 12 inches below grade. The anticipated value of the order is less than $50,000.
<p>Authority for this single source procurement is FAR 13.106(b) for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. A sources-sought synopsis issued in 2012 did not reveal any firm with comparable equipment reasonably available for work in a nearby state of Georgia. Nor did a subsequent special notice synopsized on May 17, 2013 (AG-435H-S-13-0016) for the same equipment disclose any other sources. <br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotations. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. Any firm that believes it can provide the equipment listed may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination not to compete this proposed order based on responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>All responses shall be e-mailed to Margie Yeaton at myeaton@fs.fed.us no later than Jun 25, 2013, at 4:00pm C</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Research and Development Center - Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Thermo Electron North America LLC (as a part of ThermoFisher Scientific) upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. ERDC-CERL intends to purchase a Dual Pressure Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer as well as an Ultimate 3000 Binary Pump. After extensive market research, it was determined that Thermo Electron North America LLC is the only vendor that can provide these items to meet the laboratory's specifications. These specifications include: Trap Capacity: A linear ion trap mass spectrometer is required due to its larger trapping volume which can trap a greater number (~30,000) of ions than 3-dimensional traps (Paul trap).  Limits of Detection:  2  L of a 50 fg/ L solution of reserpine (100 femtograms total) injected at a flow of 500  L/min will produce a minimum signal to noise ratio of 100:1, for the transition of the isolated protonated molecular ion at m/z 609 to the largest two product ions, m/z 397 and m/z 448, when the mass spectrometer is operated at unit resolution in the full-scan MS/MS mode, scanning the product ion spectrum from m/z 165 - 615.  Speed and Resolving Power:  Must acquire and display full scan MS/MS spectra to produce full scan product ion spectra at a speed of 66,000 Da/s with unit resolution.  Must be capable of determining 3+ and 4+ charge state ions at 10,000 Da/s.  Must resolve ion peaks from 5+ charge state or greater from a scan range of 50-2000 Da at a scan speed of 2200 Da/sec.  Must be able to fastest scan model of 125,0000 Da/s.  Must have high resolution scan mode capable of obtaining resolutions up to 20,000.  Iterative Ion Fragmentation and Analysis - MSn:  Must have MSn capabilities from n=1 to n=10. This decision was based on proprietary rights which Thermo Fisher has to produce items that meet ERDC-CERL's requirements. <br>  <br> This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement by 10:00 AM EST, 26 June 2013, by e-mail to Ashley.m.north@usace.army.mil. A determination by the Government not to compete the contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  <br>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  technical, price, and past performance. The award decision will be based on the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable offer.  Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. quote mark  <br>  <br>  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br>  <br> (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br>  <br> (End of provision) <br>  <br>  <br> ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 <br>  <br> Paragraph (a) is hereby supplemented with the following: <br>  <br>  (a).  The total evaluated price must be reasonable, and any additional expense must be justified by a corresponding value for technical merit, or an expectation of greater quality of performance.   <br>  <br> (b).   Contractors may not qualify if any of the following are not met:  <br>  <br> 1.   	Proposal does not reasonably address the requirements in the request for proposal (RFP). <br> 2.	Proposal includes major deficiencies or omissions which discussions could not be expected to cure without a major revision or a new proposal. <br>  <br> 3.	Proposal is so technically inferior or so out of line in price as compared to other proposals as to preclude it from having a reasonable chance for award. <br>  <br> 4. 	An unrealistically low price, may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement for the geographic area of service, or unbalanced pricing of line items, as proposed initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an imprudent offer. <br> 5.   The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if necessary. <br>  <br>  <br> PART I    TECHNICAL: <br>  <br> Technical capability to include product literature, catalog price lists if available; warranty, guarantee, technical specs, and delivery information. <br>  <br> Technical will be evaluated as either Acceptable or Unacceptable. Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. <br>  <br> Definitions are as follows:  <br>  <br> ACCEPTABLE: To be rated acceptable, the offeror's technical proposal must demonstrate it can meet all requirements.  <br>  <br> UNACCEPTABLE: A technical proposal that fails to demonstrate it can meet one or more requirements will be determined unacceptable.  <br>  <br>  <br> PART II   PAST PERFORMANCE <br>  <br> Offeror is required to submit information, on a single page, identifying federal, state and local Government and private contracts performed within the past three years, which are similar in scope and complexity to the effort described in this solicitation.

It shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305 and DFARS 215.305.  However, the comparative assessment in FAR 15.305(a)(2)(i) does not apply.  Therefore, past performance will be rated on an  quote mark acceptable quote mark  or  quote mark unacceptable quote mark  basis using the ratings below. <br>  <br> Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.) <br>  <br> Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br>  <br> Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, <br>  quote mark unknown quote mark  shall be considered  quote mark acceptable. quote mark    <br>  <br> PART III    PRICE: <br>  <br> Price will be evaluated separately from Technical and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability.  <br> Offeror shall provide their published price list with their offer.  <br>  <br> 52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2012) ALTERNATE I (APR 2011) <br>  <br> Vendors shall include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications with their offer.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award to SA Scientific, 4919 Golden Quail, San Antonio, Texas 78240, on a sole source basis, for the purchase of  the Loopamp LA-500 Real-time Turbidimeter for the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  SA Scientic was granted distribution rights by the international manufacturer of this item, Eiken Chemical Co., Ohtawara Japan.  WRAIR's collaborators at AFRIMS currently utilize Eiken Reagents and an Eiken turbidemeter to perform all of their LAMP assays.  LAMP has been shown to provide high specificity and amplification efficiency.  The LA-500 provides the ability to perform two different experiments simultaneously.   Competing this requirement and awarding to any other source would result in substantial delays and would result in  increased cost to the Government.  This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.    After the publication of this announcement for fifteen (15) days, solicitation W81XWH-13-T-0226 will be posted for five (days). The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is:  lottie.p.morris.civ@mail.mil  <br>  <br>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Acquisition Operation - Technology Acquisition Center - Austin (TAC-Austin) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Halfaker and Associates upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. TAC-Austin intends to purchase a six-month firm-fixed-price (FFP) effort for hosting and maintaining the VetGov Partner (VGP) portal, implementing enhancements and software patches, and providing end user support and training.   After extensive market research, it was determined that Halfaker is the only source with the unique skills and capabilities to ensure the enhancements are developed, tested, and deployed by July 19, 2013.  Halfaker is also the only source that can ensure the VGP is hosted and operational, as well as provide training and user support during the conference.  Any other source would result in duplication of cost and effort that would not be recovered through competition, in order to understand the current VGP application coding, and develop, test, deploy and train enhancements timely.  If another vendor is selected, additional risk would be incurred as the new contractor's staff may not fully understand the intent and context of the complex requirements included in this application.  Furthermore, another source would require a steep learning curve of at least 60 days in order to gain familiarity with VGP. 

This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement by 10:00 AM CST, 13 June 2013, by e-mail to leonard.eddie@va.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete the contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This notice serves as a pre-solicitation notice / procurement synopsis for the High Speed Anti-Radiation (HARM) Targeting System (HTS) System Level Automated Test Set (SLATS) upgrade. The Armament Directorate (AFLCMC/EB), Lethal SEAD/DEAD Branch (EBAS) intends to award a sole source contract to Raytheon Company, Missile Systems, 1151 E. Hermans Road, Tucson, AZ 85706-9367. This effort is to upgrade four (4) SLATS stations using modern hardware to continue providing depot support for the life cycle of the HTS pod, currently 2025 and beyond. This pre-solicitation notice covers all CLINs under the proposed contract. HTS SLATS upgrade is anticipated to be a Cost-Plus-Incentive Fee (CPIF) type contract. The contract award is planned in August 2013 with a 24 month performance period. The estimated value of this contract is $4M.
<p>The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (iii), Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Service Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Upgrading the System Level Automated Test Sets is comprised of designing, building, integrating software, and proving-in of the test sets. The software integration is HTS specific for repair. HTS uses unique testing procedures, including thermal chamber tests that must be fully integrated with HTS testing software. The combination of identifying obsolete parts, designing a SLATS test station with modern hardware, building to design, fully integrating existing HTS capability, and proving-in the completed test sets is something that cannot be accomplished by another source without an extensive amount of resources and time. Consequently, fixing the SLATS obsolescence issues requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for upgrades and integration.</p>
<p>Negotiations are expected to begin in early August 2013. The NAICS Code/Size Standard is 811219/$19M. Should your firm desire subcontracting opportunities, contact Shawn Nielson (Raytheon Company) at the above address or phone (520) 794-3027. The response date to this synopsis is 31 Jul 2013.</p>
<p>Communications concerning this acquisition should be directed to JT Tolar, Contract Specialist, (850) 883-0456 or Herbert B. Hill, Contracting Officer, at (850) 883-0180. Facsimile responses or requests sent to (850) 883-0543 are authorized if you also call and verify receipt.</p>

Additional requirements will be addressed when implemented.</p>

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 72 days before your offer is evaluated.

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

<DESC>As part of GSAs continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.

Full Products and Broad Services Offerings

Offeror must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). 

Fair and Reasonable Pricing

To determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 3 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.   

PLEASE NOTE:  ALL RESPONSES SHALL BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY AS EOFFERS 
 
The following link provides guidance on utilizing the eOffer and eMod systems, obtaining digital certificates, and using the eOffer and eMod Training Guides:  http://eoffer.gsa.gov.

The current Solicitation 6FEC-E6-030292-B, Refresh 21, dated June 11, 2013 is hereby issued to incorporate multiple clause and regulation updates, and other administrative changes. Refresh 21 replaces Refresh 20, issued December 21, 2012, in its entirety.  Offers received after June 11, 2013 using any templates or attachments from previous refresh solicitations will be rejected.
 
This solicitation is open continuously with no closing date. The resultant contracts are awarded as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity; Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment. Contract periods commence on the Date of Award through a 5-year base period with three 5-year option periods. The resultant contracts provide a streamlined acquisition approach for federal agencies to obtain services related to facilities maintenance and management solutions for real property and energy management, water conservation and support services.  Agency ordering procedures for services and further information on the GSA Multiple Award Schedules program may be found at www.gsa.gov/schedules.   
Offerors are responsible for payment to Open Ratings, Inc. for past performance evaluation prior to submission of an offer.

GSA is only issuing this solicitation/request for proposal through the FedBizOpps internet site, GSA will not provide paper copies of this solicitation. Interested parties may access the solicitation at Internet address http://www.fbo.gov. This site contains information describing the Federal Business Opportunities and how to register to receive automatic notices of acquisitions.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>3C.This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
 The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. 

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx

Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

 
These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.

 
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Brochure is now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx".

<DESC>This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a
source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of
DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing
knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor
qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the
intended application.  Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and
selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review
discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession
and cannot be economically obtained.
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not
been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have
been solicited.
  The time required for approval of a new source is normally
such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you

(3) If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (i) A contractor may obtain a DUNS number- (A) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or (B) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

(6) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (7) (i) (A) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to- (aa) Change the name in the SAM database; (bb) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (cc) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. (B) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g) (1) (i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g) (1) (i) (C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (ii) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (8) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer&rsquo;s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  <br>    <br>  HQ Army Material Command  <br>  Office of Command Counsel  <br>  9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401  <br>  Ft.

Belvoir, VA 22060-5527  <br>    <br>  The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp.  <br>  If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest Procedures.  <br>  (End of Provision)  <br>    <br>  Contract provisions and clauses may be found at:  <br>  http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm  <br>  http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vfdfara.htm  <br>  http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vfafara.htm  <br>    <br>    <br>  All quoters shall submit a signed copy of the representations and certifications specified in FAR 52.212-3 and DFARS 252.212-7000 with their quotes unless both FAR and DFARS representations and certifications are on record in SAM.gov.  <br>    <br>   Invoicing and payment shall be made using Government Purchase Card.   <br>    <br>  The point of contact for this solicitation is Dominique Howard, Contracting Specialist; via e-mail at: dominique.c.howard.civ@mail.mil.

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.
  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.
(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number?

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB685010-13-03807 <br />AMENDMENT 001
<p><br />The purpose of the following amendment is to address questions submitted regarding the specifications. The below Q&amp;A is now applicable to the specifications for the sodium heat pipe furnace liners in solicitation NB685010-13-03807.</p>
<p><br />1. What is the operating temperature range?</p>
<p>A sodium heat pipe starts working at 500 &deg;C with a nominal upper limit of 1100 &deg;C. NIST needs to use the heat pipe from 500 &deg;C to 1090 &deg;C. Lifetime goes as a function of temperature and enclosure material. From a safety point of view NIST is converting from Inconel to Haynes for the enclosure material.</p>
<p>2. What is the external diameter?</p>
<p>Nominal diameter is 3.5 inches, though a value up to 3.6 inches would be acceptable.</p>
<p>3. Are there any weight restrictions?</p>
<p>As long as one person can pick it up.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.5.&nbsp; This acquisition is not a small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System Code is&nbsp;541922 and the business size standard is $6.5 Million.&nbsp; This is an Indefinite Quantity Contract with a minimum and a maximum as contemplated by FAR16.504<br /><br />In a national effort to promote patient safety, NLM has undertaken the creation of an authoritative, comprehensive, public digital image inventory of the nation's commercial prescription solid dose medications. Our effort is a continuation and extension of three previous projects: providing the Veterans Administration with a complete digital photographic catalog of the VA Centralized Mail Order Pharmacy formulary for prescription tablets and capsules, the establishment of the NLM Pillbox information resource, and the NLM Computational Photography Project for Pill Identification (C3PI).
<p>We are creating a collection of digital photographs of prescription tablets and capsules or Oral Solid Dosage Formulations (OSDFs). The purpose of this announcement is to provide for the continuation of image acquisition of OSDFs through an open commercial competition for R&amp;D support services. The resulting award for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract will be made to a contractor or vendor who will be responsible for acquiring the sample medications (if necessary), handling, transporting, and storing medication samples, creating high resolution digital photographs of the front (obverse) and back (reverse) surfaces of the samples using conventional techniques for color management and size measurement, confirming that the images match the description of the medication, developing and matching the images of the samples to relevant metadata (including size descriptions, dimensions, color, and the provenance of the sample), composing digital images by suppressing the background and combining the front and back images into a single output image, and transmitting those data (images and metadata) to the NLM. As part of the current effort, NLM has crafted a recommended specification, SPLIMAGE, for images of oral solid dose formulations of medications to be included in the FDA's Structured Product Label initiative (see attachment of the SPLIMAGE specification). Responses to this announcement should include the necessary digital processing to generate SPLIMAGE files from the digital photographs of OSDFs. We believe that ultimately nationwide there are between 5,000 and 32,000 prescription oral solid-dose medications to be cataloged through this process.<br />The resulting digital image collection from this effort will be placed by NLM in the public domain. The impact of this collection will target patient safety including assisting in drug identification for poison control hotlines as well as online services for the public and nursing care professionals to confirm the identification of a drug to help prevent mistakes in medication. Other uses of the image collection include education and applications in pharmacy pedagogy such as its inclusion in textbooks and digital teaching materials. These applications demand high resolution, high quality images with good color reproduction to faithfully represent the medications through imagery. Smaller images and subsets of the collection can be generated from the original high-resolution data for other applications that do not require the same level of fidelity; however, we are committed to acquiring the best data possible through this mechanism.</p>
<p>NLM intends to identify a contractor or assemble a contractor-and-subcontractor team to address these issues, with the emphasis on experienced digital macro-photography talent as well as credentials and experience necessary to safely handle oral solid-dose prescription medications. The matching of the images to the correct identification of the medications is at least as critical as the dispensing of the medications to patients for treatment in that the impact of a mis-identification could have grave consequences. The need for quality control and verification in this project is likely to be significantly higher since the distribution of the resulting data could have widespread public impact, both a positive one if the collection is comprehensive and detailed, and significant negative impacts if there are errors in the database. The contractor should have clear explicit procedures for verifying the data and its correct correspondence to the medications from which it was derived. NLM expects the final team to incorporate photographers, assistants familiar with the handling of pharmaceuticals, a pharmacist for the appropriate qualifications in receiving, handling, and disposing of prescription medications, administrative technicians for the verification and electronic delivery of the digital images and their associated data, and information technology support for image processing and digital composition of the resulting reference images, the extraction of metadata, and technical support of the digital camera, its software, data storage and backup, as well as internet support to enable the electronic delivery of the digital data.</p>
<p>Optional work: A possible byproduct of this award, generated through an option to the primary contract, would be a test data collection for the advancement of automatic pharmaceutical identification through computer vision from photographic data. NLM expects to promote computer vision research applied to the domain of content-based information retrieval (CBIR) of solid-dose pharmaceuticals. The current C3PI effort has created an initial set of such images from the ongoing imaging of OSDFs and anticipates the continuing need for generating test data, including variations of photographs of the same drug or sample under different conditions and with different cameras or equipment. We invite ideas and plans for the structure for such a test collection subset of the overall imaging effort including a discussion of issues such as: (1) the number of validated sample images needed to evaluate automated drug identification algorithms, (2) the different photographic conditions and equipment necessary to effectively support a test image collection, and (3) a plan for deploying and maintaining such a collection in support of a grand challenge or other mechanism for promoting computer vision for solid-dose pharmaceutical identification.</p>
<p>We anticipate that this award will encompass the handling, storage, photography, and the electronic delivery of the resulting digital data of between 500 and 1,000 prescription medications over the course of one year. Therefore, proposals addressing this requirement should not surpass 1 year in duration. Up to&nbsp;four (4) option years for additional services with a duration of 1 year each per option (the additional acquisition of images of pharmaceutical samples in lots of between 500 and 1,000 samples) should be provided by teams responding to this requirement. Teams should also address in their proposals a additional separate option for crafting a test data collection to promote computer vision for identification of oral solid-dose formulations of pharmaceuticals, including up to&nbsp;four (4) option years for this supplementary effort.</p>
<p>Technical proposals should cover:</p>
<p>(i) Technical details for:<br />1. Sample Acquisition<br />&bull; NLM will prioritize the list of images of samples to be acquired, beginning with the most widely prescribed drugs as well as the those medications that pose a public threat either through abuse or as a poisoning hazard. NLM proposes the use of DailyMed as the source of the initial list of prescription medications (4,676 medications listed as of 10-June-2009)<br />&bull; If samples are offered by participating manufacturers or vendors, the contractor will accept these samples as available.<br />&bull; The contractor will be responsible for establishing a source of medications and ensuring that their supply chain remains viable through the life of this project.<br />&bull; The contractor will establish and maintain procedures that comply with all state and federal regulations for the management, handling, and disposal of prescription medications.<br />2. Photographic quality<br />&bull; The contractor will adhere to image quality guidelines established by the NLM pertaining to issues of: color management (ensuring that the images provided reflect the actual color of the medication), image resolution (Minimum of 6 MPixels for the field including the pharmaceutical sample), file formats, color background (18% grey color background), and fiducial marks for size, color, and white balance. NLM will provide a standard color reference for matching colors in the raw digital images.<br />3. Quality control and Data transfer<br />&bull; The contractor will develop quality control procedures with the NLM for the verification of acceptable images, matching the images with the correct metadata, and data transmission.<br />&bull; Images and metadata will be transferred to NLM, subject to verification.<br />4. Transition plan - project completion<br />&bull; After the data collection is firmly established and the period of performance nears its end, the contractor may be required to transfer the program another contractor. The plan should address a process for disclosing all documentation, file formats, database organization, and open-source software. This transition is essential for the long-term sustainability of the project.</p>
<p>(ii) Qualifications of key personnel to execute this project.<br />1. Background expertise - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team as a whole have access to the range of educational backgrounds in macrophotography, in particular in photography for documenting scientific or records of physical samples.<br />2. Experience - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team include significant experience and expertise in the production workflows for documentation photography.</p>
<p>(iii) The commitment and experience of the institution or offeror in building and releasing public data resources for patient safety in pharmaceutical information.</p>
<p>(iv) Proposed relevant facilities</p>
<p>The Technical Proposal should include examples digital images of pharmaceutical samples, demonstrating the capabilities of the respondent. These images are not included in the 15-page limit. Beyond these digital images 15 pages of technical proposal, resumes of key investigators, reprints of relevant technical papers, and other supplemental materials can be provided outside of the page limit. Reviewers are instructed that the 15-page technical proposal and the representative digital images are required reading, and supplemental materials are available as part of the support documentation but not required.</p>
<p>NLM is specifically seeking contractors with the discipline necessary to conduct this project, adhering to high standards of quality and consistency necessary to acquire high quality reference images through digital macrophotography and to verify and validate that images of these solid-dose pharmaceuticals are accurately tied to their respective medications. Regular progress evaluations may be initiated, and frequent interaction with NLM staff responsible for the imaging informatics and release of the data to the public domain is expected.</p>
<p>The deliverables for this proposed project are the photographs of the solid-dose pharmaceutical samples, the metadata and information for correctly identifying and correlating the images with their corresponding medications. The resulting images and the final data will be owned by the National Institutes of Health and distributed to the public.</p>
<p>NLM reserves the right to include a site visit as part of the proposal evaluation.</p>
<p>NLM reserves the right to include key personnel named in a proposal as well as any or all parts of the technical proposal in the contract award.</p>
<p>NLM anticipates that the first award of the photographic collection (up to 1,000 samples) will be completed within one year and costs not expected to exceed $500,000 including the cost of acquiring and disposing of the sample medications. All proposals will be evaluated on technical merit, qualifications of the personnel (including photographers, computer scientists, image processors, pharmacists, and technicians), cost, and past performance on research and development projects.<br /><br />Electronic copies of the technical proposal are due by the application deadline. In addition to the official electronic submission, five (5) printed copies of the technical proposal are required. These printed hard copies should be printed, 3-hole punched, and submitted in binders. NLM anticipates an official deadline for electronic submission by noon (12:00 PM), Tuesday June 18, 2013, with an official deadline for printed hard copy submission by close of business, Tuesday, June 18, 2013. Electronic copies of submissions should be sent via e-mail to the contracting specialist, Suet Vu, at vus@mail. nih.gov. The submission may be split into multiple e-mails to accommodate e-mail servers. At the completion of the submission of responses to the RFP, even if only a single e-mail is transmitted, an additional confirmation text-only e-mail should be transmitted, communicating that a complete submission has been sent and detailing the contents of each file and how many separate e-mail files should be expected. Paper copies may be submitted in writing to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 6707 Democracy Blvd., Suite 105, Bethesda, Maryland 20894; Attention Suet Vu, Contracting Specialist.</p>

<DESC>McAfee ESM is a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) product.  The McAfee ESM is a high performance system capable of handling tens of thousands of data events per second, it collects and correlates security information from firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems, routers, servers and other mapped devices and presents a common correlated threat picture for use by security personnel. The managed composite display and correlated security event logs of all networks is a key advantage in cyber security situation awareness. The aforementioned licenses enable use of McAfee ESM to provide real-time visibility into network, database, and application activity on the Project Manager (PM), Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 1 network.   <br>    <br>  We request that sources capable of meeting the Government's technical requirements provide a white paper of no more than 25 pages about its products and their ability to provide a situational and risk-aware SIEM system that is interoperable with the current software utilized in the PM WIN-T Increment 1 suite of Network Operations systems.  <br>

<DESC>***Update 11 June 2013- The Government plans to issue an RFP no earlier than 21 June 2013. Once the RFP is released, instructions for obtaining it will be posted to this announcement. Please feel free to contact John Conlin with any questions (john.conlin3.civ@mail.mil, 508-233-6164) <br>  <br> ----------------------- <br> SUMMARY  <br>  This is a notice of a proposed contract action issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.203(a). The Government intends to issue a solicitation and award up to 1 contract for the services described below. This acquisition is set aside 100% for small businesses, as defined below. This notice is not a solicitation; information on release of the solicitation is provided below. The Government will use the procedures of FAR Part 12  quote mark Acquisition of Commercial Items quote mark  for this acquisition.  <br>    <br>  BACKGROUND  <br>  The Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) conducts Navy Medicine Research and includes subject areas such as: (1) combat casualty care research, including traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, wounds from improvised explosive devices, etc.; (2) non-communicable disease research, including cancer research; and (3) infectious disease research, including respiratory or enteric disease research. NHRC performs both intramural and extramural research, the latter meaning that the work must be outsourced or contracted out to industry or academia performers. Therefore, NHRC is in need of Research Acquisition Specialist (RAS) contractor personnel who understand the aforementioned subject areas significantly enough to act on the relevant regulations and statute but can also translate the requirements of these subject areas into meaningful acquisition documents that a Contracting Officer can execute on. Of particular concern is that the RAS is knowledgeable of, experienced with, and can successfully act on regulations, statutes, and protocols such as those relevant to the FDA clinical trial process, which may include human use and/or animal use.  <br>    <br>  REQUIREMENT AND TYPE OF SERVICE  <br>  The RAS must be able to develop and administer acquisition documents containing human-use requirements. A contract action that involves human-use research does require assurance certification by the contractor performer. Any contract that does require research on human subjects requires that the DoD component be responsible for contractor oversight of compliance with 32 CFR Part 219, Protection of Human Subjects; and that the Government personnel responsible for such oversight is the client's Human Research Protection Official as defined by DFAR S 252.235-7004, Protection of Human Subjects. The RAS must be at a level of qualification sufficiently enough to support these Government representatives through the development and administration of acquisition documents. All research needs to be determined to be compliant with Federal and DoD regulations for protecting human subjects. All studies similarly need to be compliant with the requirements of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. Further, evolving human-subject protection regulations need to be investigated and training plans developed to educate researchers as to their human subject responsibilities. Contractor performers shall support Institutional Review Board (IRB) functions and HIPAA Privacy Office functions by reviewing all agency studies, including those in the areas of medical resource planning, enhancing performance during shipboard and ground operations, investigating and monitoring disease incidence among military personnel, development of computer systems for monitoring the physiologic status of individual patients, clinical research studies, survey administration efforts, and evaluating physiological effects of various agents found in military operational environments. Such support shall include analyzing research protocols to determine compliance with relevant human subject protection regulations and drafting administrative correspondence detailing review proceedings and findings. Support shall also include development of educational materials, monitoring of research, and database development for tracking of research protocols. Therefore, the RAS must be able to understand the aforementioned and act on such.  <br>    <br>  A contract action that involves animal use does require assurance and accreditation by the contractor performer. Any contract that does require the use of animals in research shall be compliant with all applicable Federal and DoD regulations, specifically including 7 U.S.C. 2131 et. Seq. and 9 CFR 1-4,  quote mark Animal Welfare Act quote mark ; DoDI 3216.01,  quote mark Use of Animals in DoD Programs quote mark ; and specific DoD component management plans. Evolving animal use and care regulations need to be investigated and training plans developed to educate researchers regarding their animal use and care responsibilities. Contractor performers shall support Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) functions and comply with any procedures required for IACUC approval, including research protocol submission, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) accreditation, DHHS Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) assurance, and USDA site inspections. Therefore, the RAS must be able to understand the aforementioned and act on such.  <br>    <br>  There are many more regulations, statutes, and protocols within the medicine research sector that the RAS must be able to comprehend sufficiently enough to assure that all necessary provisions are included in the acquisition documents and that that contract administration is of sufficient caliber to assure that these medical research regulations, statutes, and protocols are being adhered to by the contractor performer.  <br>  Such services are non-personal in nature and do not include inherently Governmental duties.  <br>    <br>  RELEASE OF SOLICITATION  <br>  The Government will set aside the entire requirement for small business concerns. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541611  quote mark Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, quote mark  which has a size standard of $7,000,000 in annual receipts. Concerns with annual receipts less than or equal to $7,000,000 will be considered small businesses for this acquisition.   <br>    <br>  The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) no earlier than 21 June 2013. Proposals will be due 30 calendar days following release of the RFP.  The Government will only consider proposals offered from responsible small businesses.   <br>    <br>  The Government intends to award no more than 1 firm fixed priced, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with a term of 36 months using the procedures of FAR Part 12  quote mark Acquisition of Commercial Items. quote mark   <br>    <br>  QUESTIONS  <br>    <br>  Questions about this acquisition may be directed to John Conlin (john.conlin3.civ@mail.mil, 508-233-6164)  <br>

No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this sources sought or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this sources sought synopsis. No contract will be awarded from this announcement.

The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.  <br>    <br>  PEO Aviation   <br>  Tactical Systems Branch  <br>    <br>  Applicability:  AH-64, CH-47F, OH-58F, UH-60M  <br>  Based on the exponential growth of digital data on aircraft and significant growth in use/re-use of recorded data and derived analysis results in the need for higher volume, faster download, lower total ownership cost, and reduced logistics footprint.  Additionally, the U.S. Army desires extensible, functional requirements: mission recorder, crash survivability, data loader, digital video recorder, maintenance diagnostics, and encryption of recorded data among its aviation assets.  A cross domain solution that provides hardware and software for the transfer of information between the DoD's classified and unclassified networks. This transfer of information between networks of different security domains is conducted using various cross domain guard technologies and accomplished with high assurance, speed, and integrity.  <br>    <br>  The desired approach includes a single, common high capacity recorder combining independent capabilities into a multifunctional solution for cost savings, ease of integration, decreased logistics footprint, and reduced life cycle costs.  This solution would also serve as a ready replacement for legacy recorders that go out of production, become obsolete/unsupportable, or require upgrade of operational capability.  It is imperative the solution use of a mature, fielded, well-defined inter-service software standard to allow for non-proprietary use and development of third-party software packages.   <br>    <br>  Please submit your product information if it meets the required capabilities below.    <br>    <br>  Required Capabilities:  <br>    <br>  User Workload:  <br>    <br>   	Cannot increase user workload in the cockpit  <br>    <br>  Storage:  <br>    <br>   	Capability to have at least 4 storage drives in one device  <br>   	All storage types must be user removable media   <br>   	Consolidate to one primary media type while being backwards compatible with older media  <br>   	Option for Compact Flash Memory Type 1 storage greater than 128 GB  <br>   	Option for PCMICA Flash memory storage greater than 4 GB  <br>   	Option for SSD memory storage greater than 300 GB  <br>    <br>  Encryption and Classification:  <br>    <br>   	Capable of classified data processing  <br>   	Capable FIPS 140-2 Type 1 and Type 2 Encryption  <br>   	Provides hardware and software for the transfer of information between the DoD's classified and unclassified networks  <br>   	Encryption key wipe and drive wipe capability  <br>   	Capable of clear/purge I/A/W SP 800-88 (REV1)  <br>    <br>  Key Management:  <br>    <br>   	Encryption keys must be easily shared across multiple aircraft and platforms  <br>   	Encryption keys must be easily shared across multiple computers  <br>    <br>  Physical Interfaces:  <br>    <br>   	At least 4 Gigabit or higher Ethernet digital communication interfaces  <br>   	At least 2 MIL-STD-1553B digital communication interfaces  <br>   	At least 1 Fiber Channel digital communication interfaces  <br>   	At least 1 SATA digital communication interfaces  <br>   	At least 1 RS232 digital communication interfaces via CMWS  <br>   	Connectors should be adaptable to each platform to prevent rewiring of aircraft   <br>    <br>  Protocols Supported at a Minimum:  <br>    <br>   	FTP  <br>   	TFTP  <br>   	CIFS/SMB  <br>    <br>  Component Size:  <br>    <br>   	Weight - less than 4 lbs.  <br>    <br>  Component Power:  <br>    <br>   	Consume less than 25 Watts at 100-125VAC, 1.55Amps, 380-420Hz single phase.  <br>    <br>  Component:  <br>    <br>   	Family of System (FOS) utilizing a Modular Open System Approach (MOSA)  <br>   	Have the ability to obtain an airworthiness release (AWR) for utilization in flight  <br>   	Source data necessary to facilitate Airworthiness Release (AWR) approval   <br>   	Minimal impact to aircraft structures   <br>   	Reach full qualification approval within 6-9 months from full procurement contract award  <br>   	Provide warranty and level of customer support   <br>   	Level of Repair Analysis (LORA) indicating the skill level required for the repair of the common data loader  <br>   	Identify any necessary training materials required for operation  <br>   	Identify any assumptions  <br>   	Extensible to allow for ease of memory replacement and obsolescence issues  <br>    <br>  Certification and Accreditation:  <br>    <br>   	MIL-STD-810G  <br>   	DO-178B - Level B (Hazardous)  <br>   	DoD 8500 Defense Information Assurance Certification & Accreditation Process (DIACAP)  <br>   	AR 25-2  <br>   	AWR  <br>   	NSA for encryption  <br>    <br>  The attributes listed below are advantageous to the Common Data Loader:  <br>    <br>  Storage:  <br>    <br>   	Option Compact Flash Memory Type 2 storage greater than 128 GB   <br>  Encryption and Classification:  <br>   	2 Channel Cross Domain Solution   <br>    <br>  Component:  <br>    <br>   	Have 1 (one) configuration to satisfy all aircraft  <br>   	List of airframe impacts and modifications necessary  <br>   	Proposed schedule for reaching First Article Test (FAT), fielding  <br>   	Government Furnished Equipment/Information (GFE/I) requirements  <br>   	Tradeoffs identified  <br>   	Incremental and phased approach to achieve all desired requirements  <br>    <br>  The attributes listed below would further benefit the Common Data Loader:  <br>    <br>  Encryption and Classification:  <br>    <br>   	3 Channel Cross Domain Solution   <br>    <br>  Please provide as much technical specifications as possible.

<DESC>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requires Design/Build construction contract documents including, specifications, and drawings depicting existing conditions and proposed construction, a finalized construction cost estimate and construction of the approved drawings and specifications for construction of a boat dock/loading/offloading area at Partners Point on Lake Havasu. The work requires furnishing transportation, labor, equipment and materials to design and construct foundations, seawall, retaining wall, and improvements including associated earthwork, erosion control and surface drainage and ramps, railings and security fencing/gate required to provide a safe and functioning area for loading and offloading materials and personnel from boats alongside the shoreline of Lake Havasu in Arizona. The Concept Drawings and Outline Specifications represent a solution which requires furnishing transportation, labor, equipment and materials to design and construct a concrete retaining wall and seawall comprised of interlocking steel sheet-piles along the shoreline of Lake Havasu. This work includes site survey for contours, design planning and development, preparation of specifications and drawings, construction layout, sheet pile installation backfilling and compaction, tie-back anchor installation, concrete slab and decking, temporary and permanent security fencing and gates, concrete retaining wall, pipe railing, concrete caps, erosion control and surface drainage. The project area is approximately 0.2 acres, not including a potential additional stockpile/staging area that is located northerly from the project site, approximately 300 feet away, alongside the project site access road.  The work requires design and construction personnel with knowledge of wave action and river flows. LOCATION:  Travel 0.26 miles west on Sweetwater Avenue to the BLM Lake Havasu Field Office, which is located at 2610 Sweetwater Avenue, Lake Havasu City, AZ. 86406; thence 1.16 miles south on an unnamed road to the Partners Point work yard.

<p>Technical Support for the Advisory Board on Radiation and</p>
<p>Worker Health's Review of NIOSH Dose Reconstruction Program</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Draft Statement of Work dated January 2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C1. Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide technical support to the Board to fulfill its obligations under its HHS Charter to review the scientific validity and quality of radiation dose reconstructions conducted by NIOSH and to advise the Secretary of HHS on whether doses can be estimated with sufficient accuracy for classes of employees at DOE and AWE facilities petitioning to be added to the SEC. More specifically, the objectives are to perform the following activities in support of the Board, using review methods and criteria consistent with relevant statutes and the HHS regulations cited above, as interpreted by HHS, and conforming to the current policies, procedures, and precedents of completed Board reviews:</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate the scientific validity and quality of a sample of dose reconstructions completed by NIOSH under EEOICPA;<br />&bull; Evaluate the scientific validity and quality of procedures and methods by which NIOSH conducts dose reconstructions under EEOICPA, including but not limited to the review of site profiles, implementation guidelines, technical basis documents, technical information bulletins, workbooks, and other forms of dose reconstruction procedures; and<br />&bull; Evaluate the technical merits of SEC petitions and NIOSH evaluations of these petitions.</p>
<p>C2. Background and Need</p>
<p>In October 2000, President Clinton signed into law the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act of 2000 (EEOICPA), establishing a federal compensation program for employees of the Department of Energy (DOE), its predecessor agencies and their contractors and subcontractors, and Atomic Weapons Employers (AWEs). On July 31, 2001, covered employees with cancer, beryllium disease, or silicosis that may be related to work at nuclear weapons production programs of DOE and its predecessor agencies began applying to the Department of Labor (DOL) under the procedures and requirements of 20 C.F.R. pt. 30.</p>
<p>Under Part B of EEOICPA, a covered employee with cancer may submit a claim for a lump sum monetary compensation of $150,000 and medical benefits by either obtaining a probability of causation determination or becoming a member of the Special Exposure Cohort (SEC). EEOICPA established an SEC consisting of classes of employees who have one or more of 22 specific cancers and have worked for a specific period of time at one of the SEC work sites. These employees' cancers are presumed to be radiogenic and a dose reconstruction is not required. The EEOICPA permits individuals to petition the Secretary of HHS on behalf of a class of employees to be added to the SEC.</p>
<p>For most employees with cancer, EEOICPA requires a probability of causation determination that the cancer was "at least as likely as not" caused by the occupational radiation dose incurred by the employee. Specifically, EEOICPA mandates that guidelines for determining the probability of causation should be based on the radiation dose received by the employee (or a group of employees performing similar work) at such facility and the upper 99 percent confidence interval of the probability of causation in the radioepidemiological tables published by the National Cancer Institute. The radiation dose would then be incorporated into the dose reconstruction methods established by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), while taking into consideration the type of cancer, past health-related activities (such as smoking), information on the risk of developing a radiation-related cancer from workplace exposure, and other relevant factors.</p>
<p>On May 2, 2002, HHS published 42 C.F.R. pt. 81, "Guidelines for Determining the Probability of Causation," and 42 C.F.R. pt. 82, "Methods for Radiation Dose Reconstruction under the Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000," as final rules in the Federal Register (Vol. 67, No. 85). 42 C.F.R. pt. 81 is used by DOL to determine the probability of causation for a claimant's cancer; while 42 C.F.R. pt. 82 is used by NIOSH to provide DOL with dose estimates for claimants who submitted Part B claims for dose reconstructions. <br />The dose reconstruction rule describes the general methods that NIOSH uses in estimating occupational radiation doses under EEOICPA. These methods are designed to provide fair and efficient processing of a high volume of dose reconstructions.</p>
<p>Specifically, once DOL receives a Part B claim, it forwards the claims to NIOSH and requests it to provide an estimate of the radiation dose received by the employee. NIOSH uses the dose reconstruction guidelines to reconstruct the occupational radiation doses incurred by the employee. As discussed in the rule, the radiation dose estimates will first take into account information from personnel monitoring records (for example dosimeter badge readings and bioassay sample analyses) and then apply dose reconstruction methods as necessary. DOL then uses the radiation dose and the HHS probability of causation guidelines to determine the probability of causation for a claimant's cancer.</p>
<p>DOL has referred more than 35,000 claims to NIOSH for dose reconstruction through November 30, 2011. DOL continues to refer new and rework cases to NIOSH at the rate of about 275 per month.</p>
<p>As stated above, EEOICPA established an SEC consisting of classes of employees who have at least one of the 22 specific cancers and have worked for a specific period of time at one of the SEC work sites. Congress also allowed for additional groups, or classes of, employees to be added to the SEC, and this task is delegated to HHS per Executive Order 13,179. On May 28, 2004, HHS issued 42 CFR 83 as a final rule (Federal Register Vol. 69, No. 104). This rule describes the procedures HHS will use to designate additional classes of employees as members of the SEC. Classes are added to the SEC when HHS determines that radiation dose reconstruction is not feasible because the information available is not adequate to allow doses to be reconstructed with sufficient accuracy. The SEC petition process is administered by NIOSH on behalf of HHS.</p>
<p>There are two ways to initiate an SEC petition for adding a class of workers to the SEC. Individuals may initiate the evaluation of a class by submitting a petition to NIOSH documenting reasons why dose reconstruction is not feasible (as described in 42 C.F.R. &sect; 83.13); or NIOSH may initiate the addition of a class on its own, based upon its research into the potential exposures at a covered facility (as described in 42 CFR . &sect; 83.14). When NIOSH initiates the addition of a class, a simplified petition is obtained from a representative claimant from the class. Regardless who initiates the SEC petition, NIOSH prepares a petition evaluation report, which describes the information available for reconstructing doses, reaches a conclusion about the feasibility of dose reconstruction, and determines if there was a potential for harm to the members of the class.</p>
<p>EEOICPA also established the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health (referred to hereafter as "ABRWH" or "the Board") to provide independent review of the scientific validity and quality of the NIOSH dose reconstruction program and to recommend to the Secretary of HHS whether it is feasible to "estimate doses with sufficient accuracy" for each class of employees petitioning to be added to the SEC. The Board is also charged more specifically under its dose reconstruction review function to review a sample of dose reconstruction cases, as an element of evaluating scientific validity and quality. The scope of the sample is unspecified by EEOICPA and the Board's charter but the Board has a target of reviewing up to 2 percent of the total number adjudicated dose reconstruction cases. For the evaluation of SEC petitions, the Board begins its work once NIOSH has presented its evaluation report providing its recommendations for the disposition of the petition. The Board evaluates the NIOSH evaluation report but also independently evaluates the petition and any other information it deems pertinent to establishing its recommendation for the disposition of the petition.</p>
<p>The Board is supported technically in all of its abovementioned functions by a contractor, which is the subject of this contract solicitation. The contractor is responsible for providing a variety of evaluative work products (technical reports), as specified below, that the Board considers in performing its various types of reviews and producing its recommendations. These work products are heavily dependent on health physics science and practices, related disciplines (e.g., statistics, ionizing radiation physics, nuclear engineering), and extensive informational research and analysis relying on NIOSH-accumulated reports as well as de-novo data collection from DOE and its site contractors, and other sources. The contractor is also responsible for providing technical support to the Board (and its subcommittees and work groups) as it works to resolve findings of its technical support contractor with the determinations of the NIOSH Division of Compensation Analysis and Support (DCAS), which operates the NIOSH dose reconstruction program. The NIOSH DCAS Web page at: www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas includes detailed information on the legal infrastructure of the dose reconstruction program, its policies and technical procedures (both generic and specific to individual DOE and Atomic Weapons Employer ["AWE"] facilities), Board policies and procedures, SEC recommendations and final HHS designations and determinations, transcripts from the Board and its work groups and subcommittees, as well as the work products of its current technical support contractor. Careful review of this information would provide a thorough grounding in the nature, methods, and conditions of technical support of the Board described here, and it would also be instructive on the scope and content of this support.</p>
<p>C.3. Contract Tasks</p>
<p>The support services that the contractor will provide are listed below. It is expected that the level of support required during the base year and during each option year will vary. However, while the number of dose reconstruction cases, dose reconstruction procedures, and SEC petitions and petition evaluation reports to be reviewed may vary substantially from year to year, offerers should prepare their proposals assuming that the levels of support specified below will be required annually. It should be understood that this is not a guarantee of this level of effort annually, but these target values will facilitate comparison of proposals from multiple offerers.</p>
<p>The contractor providing technical support to the Board will have access to all NIOSH documentation, procedures, and data used in dose reconstruction and in the evaluation of SEC petitions. This includes the following:</p>
<p>(1) All documents that describe radiation exposures, radiological operations, radiological conditions, and other information useful to performing dose reconstruction, evaluating SEC petitions, or performing other functions of the project will be stored in the Site Research Data Base (SRDB). The SRDB contains documents that relate to DOE and AWE facilities. These documents can include, but are not limited to, general overview documents, publications for a site that describe a particular process or operation, or reports from a site addressing particular issues such as specific contaminants to which some workers might have been exposed. Project personnel populate and use the SRDB to develop and write Site Profiles, TBDs and TIBs, as well as to perform dose reconstructions.</p>
<p>(2) Information relevant to individual claims will be stored in the NIOSH OCAS Claims Tracking System (NOCTS). NOCTS was developed to track the claims made under EEOICPA. The NOCTS application tracks claimant data and documents, and is thus a central repository for all information related to each claim. The web-based interface allows the application to be accessed by any computer equipped with Internet connection and browser software. The primary goal of NOCTS is to facilitate the processing of claims in an efficient and accurate manner. The application also provides an instrument for effective and timely communications with claimants during this process. Another goal is to establish and maintain interagency communications among all the parties involved in the claims process.</p>
<p>The contractor will also need to conduct data captures from DOE and employees of DOE and AWEs to fulfill this requirement, which will be governed by existing Board policy and procedures to ensure national security (see Board "Data Access and Interview Procedures, Proc-010" on the NIOSH DCAS Web page) and appropriate stewardship of Federal records. The contractor will be required to submit to NIOSH immediately upon release to the contractor all data, reports, and other information it acquires during its data captures from DOE and AWE facilities, other sources of documentation accessed, and completed (DOE cleared - as applicable) interviews of current and former employees of these facilities. NIOSH will maintain these submissions as require by law and Federal regulations under the NIOSH system of records associated with the EEOICPA dose reconstruction program, which is organized as described above. NIOSH recordkeeping will ensure these submissions remain available to the contractor as needed.</p>
<p>Support Services Requirements</p>
<p>1.0 Dose Reconstruction Case Reviews</p>
<p>The contractor will complete up to 60 dose reconstruction case reviews annually.</p>
<p>A. OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>A.1 For full internal and external (i.e., "best estimate") dose reconstructions (up to 45 annually), reviews must:<br />&bull; Report on compliance with DCAS dose reconstruction procedures (current at the time of the dose reconstruction) including site specific and generic procedures.<br />&bull; Report on defects of procedures employed in the dose reconstruction that underestimate dose or improperly overestimate dose OR have the potential to result in such errors for other cases not reviewed.<br />&bull; Report on data employed in or omitted from the dose reconstruction that by use, misapplication, or omission, inaccurately underestimate dose or improperly overestimate dose OR have the potential to result in errors for other cases not reviewed.<br />&bull; Report on errors or patterns of errors when such are indicative of a potential deficiency in quality management.<br />&bull; Characterize errors with respect to their consequence for the compensability of the review case and their likely consequence for other cases not reviewed.<br />&bull; Specify whether assumptions conferring claimant favorability were applied to uncertain information employed in estimating doses.<br />&bull; Report on the extent to which claimant-provided information is acknowledged and addressed in dose reconstruction report to the claimant.<br />&bull; With respect to the appropriateness and adequacy of procedures and data sources used in the dose reconstruction, reviews must be fully consistent with decisions produced from the Board's issue resolution process from its reviews of site profiles, SEC petitions, and dose reconstruction procedures. However, reviews should re-raise resolved issues if the review produces a new perspective on the resolved matter not previously considered by the Board that substantially calls into question the agreed upon resolution. Further, reviews should identify any issues brought to light by the individual case that have not been addressed by the Board through prior reviews of relevant dose reconstruction procedures, the site profile, or SEC petitions.</p>
<p>A.2 For dose reconstruction cases representing efficiency-driven overestimates and underestimates (up to 15 annually) , reviews must:<br />&bull; Report on compliance with DCAS dose reconstruction procedures (current at the time of the dose reconstruction) including site specific and generic procedures, specifying instances of non-compliance that result in errors in the estimation of dose.<br />&bull; Report on the appropriateness of the efficiency processes applied in the case.<br />&bull; Report on procedures employed to underestimate or overestimate dose if such procedure may not have underestimated or overestimated dose (as intended) in the specific case or may not consistently underestimate or overestimate dose (as intended) for other cases not reviewed.<br />&bull; Report on data incorrectly employed in or omitted from the dose reconstruction. <br />&bull; Report on errors or patterns of errors when such are indicative of a potential deficiency in quality management. <br />&bull; Characterize errors with respect to their consequence for the compensability of the review case and their likely consequence for other cases not reviewed.<br />&bull; Specify whether "worst case" assumptions and/or assumptions conferring claimant favorability were consistently applied as appropriate in place of further research in cases that are non-compensable "overestimates".<br />&bull; Report on the extent to which claimant-provided information is acknowledged and addressed in dose reconstruction report to the claimant.<br />&bull; With respect to the appropriateness and adequacy of procedures and data sources used in the dose reconstruction, reviews must be fully consistent with decisions produced from the Board's issue resolution process from its reviews of site profiles, SEC petitions, and dose reconstruction procedures. However, reviews should re-raise resolved issues if the review produces a new perspective on the resolved matter not previously considered by the Board that substantially calls into question the agreed upon resolution. Further, reviews should identify any issues brought to light by the individual case that have not been addressed by the Board through prior reviews of relevant dose reconstruction procedures, the site profile, or SEC petitions.</p>
<p>B. REQUIRED PROCEDURES</p>
<p>The procedure for the review of dose reconstructions should include (but is not limited to) the following elements, as appropriate:</p>
<p>B.1. Review Data Collection</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate whether NIOSH received all requested data for the DOE or AWE site from any relevant data source or repository and whether all relevant data sources, including sources maintained by NIOSH, were appropriately queried and applied to the case (not necessary for compensable cases).</p>
<p>&bull; Review the entire administrative record to evaluate whether all relevant information was considered by NIOSH (not necessary for compensable cases)</p>
<p>&bull; Review the relevant data elements of the Site Profile, Technical Basis Document, and other dose reconstruction procedures, as they apply to the individual case, to evaluate the adequacy and completeness of the data used in the case and to evaluate whether the information from the procedures is consistent with the information used for the case.</p>
<p><br />B.2. Review Claimant Interview and Documentation</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate whether NIOSH appropriately addressed all documentation and reported work history and events submitted by the claimants including but not limited to a) incidents or occurrences, b) actual monitoring practices, c) personal protection practices, and d) work practices.</p>
<p>&bull; Assure that interview information is consistent with data used for the dose estimate, and when not, evaluate whether there is appropriate justification for inconsistencies.</p>
<p>B.3. Review Internal and External Dose Estimates</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate whether the data were appropriately adjusted, as necessary, to reflect limitations of site radiological monitoring protocols of the time period (not necessary for efficiency-driven underestimates).</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate the treatment of &lsquo;missed dose' and/or &lsquo;unmonitored dose' when relevant to the case.</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate whether the dose estimate is consistent with relevant radiological information in the NIOSH site profile (e.g. evaluate whether air monitoring or swipe data are consistent with bioassay results, to the extent expected in light of work and safety practices and other factors).</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate whether appropriate doses from co-worker models were derived and applied, when relevant to the case.</p>
<p>B.4. Evaluate relevant portions of the methods and/or procedures used by NIOSH</p>
<p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate methods for estimating each component of dose (internal, external, ambient, medical) relevant to the case.</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate methods for estimating &lsquo;missed dose' and &lsquo;un-monitored dose' (for cases related to monitoring technology and for cases where monitoring was not performed, monitoring data are not available, incomplete, or otherwise inadequate).</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate the statistical approaches developed for multiple dose reconstructions.<br /><br />&bull; Evaluate methods or procedures used for substituting exposure information (area monitoring, swipe samples, source term and process analyses) for unavailable or incomplete personal monitoring information,</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate methods for accounting for uncertainty in dose distributions and uncertainty distributions around internal and external dose estimates on a facility and time specific basis and evaluate whether the uncertainties were addressed by a claimant favorable approach.</p>
<p>&bull; Review the relevant aspects of the Site Profile, Technical Basis Document, and other dose reconstruction procedures, as they apply to the individual case, to evaluate their appropriate application to the case and their adequacy for estimating all doses associated with the case. Review should also reflect the current status of reviews of relevant procedures by the Board, taking into account the Board's approval of procedures as well as any unresolved consideration by the Board of procedures that remain under review.</p>
<p>B.5. Evaluate Effectiveness of Quality Control</p>
<p>Identify any quality control failures as evidenced by defects in cases that represent non-compliance with established dose reconstruction procedure and characterize the seriousness of the defects as they impact the case or potentially impact other cases not reviewed.</p>
<p>B.6. Provide Case Reports</p>
<p>Summarize the findings of individual cases reviewed, present summary findings to Board member teams (assigned to each case by the Board Chair), incorporate any changes arising from this consultation with Board members, and produce and distribute a written report.</p>
<p>C. BLIND DOSE RECONSTRUCTION CASE REVIEWS</p>
<p>The contractor will complete up to 6 "blind dose reconstructions reviews" annually in which the contractor independently conducts dose reconstructions on cases already completed by NIOSH (without information on the results of the NIOSH dose reconstruction) to examine the scientific validity of dose reconstruction procedures, the adequacy of available data, and the degree of professional judgment implicit in the procedures and its impact on dose reconstruction results. Blind dose reconstructions will:</p>
<p>&bull; Use all raw data available to NIOSH,<br />&bull; Produce two cases; one which follows all NIOSH dose reconstruction procedures, and a second which follows all NIOSH dose reconstruction procedures reviewed and approved by the Board but uses independent discretion in applying or diverging from procedures not yet approved by the Board,<br />&bull; Apply independent professional judgment on all matters left by dose reconstruction procedures to be determined by professional judgment,<br />&bull; Formulate and apply procedures to address any matters not addressed by approved NIOSH procedures, <br />&bull; Estimate radiation doses and apply IREP to the results,<br />&bull; Compare the resulting dose reconstruction(s) (potentially 2) to that completed by NIOSH, identify and characterize the causes and consequences of any differences, and discuss the acceptability or potential problems associated with these findings.<br />&bull; Propose follow-up evaluations or actions, as necessary, based on the findings.</p>
<p>D. ISSUE RESOLUTION</p>
<p>The contractor will provide technical support to the Subcommittee on Dose Reconstruction Review in the resolution of findings from its own reviews and from those of members of the Board or the Subcommittee that may be questioned or disputed by NIOSH or by members of the Board or Subcommittee. This existing resolution process is documented in the transcripts of the Subcommittee, which can be found at www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas. It will include producing matrix-style reports summarizing the findings of individual and groups of dose reconstruction case reviews, as directed, and updating these reports as findings are resolved.</p>
<p>2.0 Dose Reconstruction Procedures Reviews</p>
<p>As part of NIOSH's program of completing individual dose reconstructions, NIOSH has established and is routinely updating and improving dose reconstruction procedures that include site-specific procedures, guidance, and data, such as "site profiles," and "technical basis documents", and related "work books" (programmed implementation tools), as well as generic multi-site and universal procedures, such as "technical information bulletins -- TIBs", "implementation guidelines IGs", "program evaluation reports "PERs", and other reports. These various procedures, as well as past reviews of such procedures by the Board's technical support contractor can be found at www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas. NIOSH also maintains a "Site Research Data Base" ("SRDB") which includes extensive records and reports that provide some of the bases for these dose reconstruction procedures as well as data applied by these procedures for completing individual dose reconstructions.</p>
<p>The contractor shall review selected procedures and related implementation tools and data established by NIOSH to evaluate their scientific validity and quality as applied for purposes of individual dose reconstructions under EEOICPA.</p>
<p>A. Scope</p>
<p>The contractor will complete annually up to 6 site profile reviews, up to 6 reviews of generic dose reconstruction procedures, and up to 6 reviews of program evaluation reports. Actual activity annually may vary from these estimates, which are provided to facilitate comparison of proposals from multiple offerers.</p>
<p>B. Review Approach</p>
<p>Reviews will focus on whether the procedures and related data used by NIOSH are scientifically valid and of adequate quality for correctly determining individual eligibility for compensation. The review should include a close evaluation of the health physics, statistical treatments, and other dose reconstruction methods employed and an evaluation of whether NIOSH identified, evaluated, and where appropriate, incorporated all available and necessary data sources (from the NIOSH SRDB, DOE, and other sources as applicable) within the procedure. In some instances, evaluating whether the data identification, collection, and evaluation processes were adequate may require the contractor to conduct interviews (one-on-one or group) with employees, employee representatives, advocacy organizations, health and academic researchers and other site &lsquo;experts' (those with long standing knowledge of processes, materials, events, and exposures). The contractor may be required to conduct meetings with these individuals or groups at locations near the facilities of interest. It will frequently be important for the contractor to examine the availability of dosimetrically relevant information in relation to scope, characteristics, and times and locations of radiological exposures. This information will often be relevant in evaluating the adequacy of related dose reconstruction procedures. For certain procedure reviews, such as select PER reviews, the contractor may also be directed to review a small number of individual dose reconstructions completed under the procedure to examine the adequacy of the procedure and its implementation.</p>
<p>C. Issue Resolution</p>
<p>The contractor will provide technical support to the Subcommittee on Procedure Reviews, Board work groups (many of which are site-specific), and the Board in the resolution of findings from its own reviews or Board member reviews that may be questioned or disputed by NIOSH or by other members of the Board, the Subcommittee, or Board work groups. This existing resolution process is documented in the transcripts of the Subcommittee, the Board work groups, and the Board, which can be found at www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas. The process will include producing a matrix-style report summarizing findings of the procedure review and updating the report as findings are resolved. It may also include producing "white papers" and other limited analyses required to examine, verify, and/or validate findings and or approaches proposed by NIOSH, Board members, or the Board's contractor to resolve findings. The volume of this resolution work may vary widely from one procedure review to another. Offerers should assume that resolution work for a procedure review will require 10 percent of the effort involved in producing its initial review report.</p>
<p>3.0 Review of SEC Petitions</p>
<p>42 C.F.R. pt. 83, Procedures for Designating Classes of Employees as Members of the Special Exposure Cohort under EEOICPA of 2000, describes the general procedures to be followed in the review of SEC Petitions. Section 83.15 describes how the Board will consider and advise the Secretary of HHS on a petition.</p>
<p>The contractor shall evaluate SEC petitions and associated NIOSH Evaluation Reports as requested, consistent with the provisions of sections 83.13, 83.14, 83.15, and in accordance with related NIOSH and Board Procedures. These and other relevant materials, including past reviews of the Board's technical support contractor, can be found at www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas.</p>
<p><br />A. Scope</p>
<p>The contractor will review annually up to 8 SEC Petitions and associated NIOSH Evaluation reports, or review parts thereof as directed. The extent of original research, data capture, and interviews of experts and site employees and retirees required of the contractor will vary. It will depend on the extent to which this information has already been captured by NIOSH and the Board's technical support contractor and is available through the SRDB or in holdings set aside for NIOSH and the Board at DOE. At the recommendation of the Board, the contractor may be asked to review either the complete SEC Petition and NIOSH Evaluation Report or specified elements of these.</p>
<p>B. Review Approach</p>
<p>Reviews will focus on the adequacy and reliability of available documents and monitoring data as well as an analysis of the scientific validity and quality of methods proposed by NIOSH to accomplish individual dose reconstructions for all members of a petitioning class. The review will examine whether all radiological doses associated with the class can be bounded or estimated more precisely using approved methods and adequate data. The central concern of reviews will be to support the Board with technical information and analyses by which it can deliberate and recommend to the Secretary whether, in its view, doses can be reconstructed with sufficient accuracy. Complete reviews of petitions will typically involve the following: <br />&bull; some original data capture and interviews of petitioners, site experts, employees, and/or retirees;<br />&bull; analysis of proposed procedures and available monitoring, process, and source term data and information in comparison to information indicating actual and potential radiological conditions;<br />&bull; statistical analyses to assess data completeness and representativeness;<br />&bull; assessment of the pedigree and reliability of essential data; <br />&bull; evaluation of the appropriateness of any use of surrogate data in light of Board and NIOSH criteria for such use; and<br />&bull; consideration of illustrative dose reconstructions examples provided by NIOSH to demonstrate the feasibility of dose reconstruction with sufficient accuracy.</p>
<p>C. Issue Resolution</p>
<p>The contractor will provide technical support to the Board and its relevant work groups in the resolution of findings from its own petition review analyses and from those of members of the Board that may be questioned or disputed by NIOSH or by members of the Board. This existing resolution process is documented in the transcripts of Board work groups and the Board, which can be found at www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas. The process will include producing a matrix-style report summarizing findings of the petition review and updating the report as findings are resolved. It may also include producing "white papers" and other limited analyses required to examine, verify, and/or validate findings and/or approaches proposed by NIOSH, Board members, or the Board's contractor to resolve findings. The volume of this resolution work may vary widely from one SEC petition review to another. Offerers should assume that resolution work for a SEC petition review will require 30 percent of the effort involved in producing its initial review report.</p>
<p>4.0 Program Management</p>
<p>A. Within 90 days of award, the contractor will develop and implement procedures for complying with NIOSH's Conflict of Interest Policy, provided as Attachment 3. Copies of those procedures and the completion of documentation required for their implementation will be provided to NIOSH at that time.</p>
<p>B. The contractor will prepare and submit to NIOSH monthly performance and cost reports covering all tasks under this contract. The monthly report shall include but need not be limited to progress reports on the following: <br />&bull; dose reconstruction case reviews (on a per-set basis), using an earned value management (EVM) system of reporting; <br />&bull; dose reconstruction procedure reviews (on an individual review basis);<br />&bull; SEC petition reviews (on an individual review basis); and<br />&bull; Program management actions.<br />Reports will clearly specify the tasks, progress and monthly and cumulative cost of each activity (and items within the activity) above that is scheduled or underway and summarize each activity completed. For each activity underway (e.g., review of site profile "xyz"), the report will specify the individuals who worked on the activity during the month, and the hours and task(s) conducted by individual.</p>
<p>D. Within 30 days of award, the contractor will ensure that all personnel intended to access the relevant NIOSH system of records and CDC information technology systems have submitted appropriate applications and completed relevant mandatory CDC training for security IDs, information security, and records management. This standard of 30 days also applies to all new personnel recruited during the award period. No personnel shall receive such access until all approvals are complete.</p>
<p>E. The contractor must provide among its staff an adequate number of individuals with the proper level of Department of Energy (DOE) security clearances ("Q clearances") to complete the work envisioned under this contract. All contractor staff must comply with applicable HHS and CDC policies for safeguarding information retrieved from HHS, DOE, and other government and non-government information, including the NIOSH/Board Security Plan with DOE.</p>
<p>F. All reports produced by the contractor shall be 508 compliant. Additionally, the recipient of the records (the contractor) will maintain the records captured in accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. &sect; 552) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Privacy Act Regulations (5 C.F.R. &sect; 5b), Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. &sect; 552), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Freedom of Information Regulations (45 C.F.R. &sect; 5.65), Executive Order No. 12,600, and the Federal Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1905 as applicable.</p>

<DESC><p>NOMENCLATURE: FEED COLUMN<br />NSN 5840 01 145 4684<br />QUANTITY: 2<br /><br />INSPECTION/ACCEPTANCE - ORIGIN<br />FOB POINT - ORIGIN<br /><br />DELIVERY - 425 DAYS<br /><br />STOCKING LOCATION - BARSTOW, CA<br /><br />APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY - LOCKHEED MARTIN / 03538<br /><br />APPROVED PART NUMBER&nbsp;- 7327460G1<br /><br />CERTIFIED COST AND PRICING DATA IS REQUIRED</p>

<p>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate or remove the following (A, B, &amp; C) from the solicitation # SPRAL1-12-R-0023 since Lockheed Martin (sole source) proposed FOB origin with inspection/acceptance at origin.</p>
<p>A) The Inspection/Acceptance and FOB Point under CLIN 0001 is hereby incorporate to read as follows:</p>

<p>Note: Remove all reference to provision # 52.213-9001 "Evaluation factors for source inspection".</p>
<p>B) Supplies and Packaging address is hereby incorporate:</p>
<p>03538<br />Lockheed Martin<br />497 Electronics PKWY BLDG 5<br />Liverpool, NY 13088</p>
<p>ADMINISTER BY (Block# 6 of the first page of the contract).</p>
<p>DCMA Syracuse (S3306A)<br />615 Erie Blvd. West<br />Suite 300<br />Syracuse, NY 13204-2408</p>
<p>INCORPORATE all reference to provision/clause # 52.246-9008: "Local Guidance: Use DLAD guidance unless procuring FMS. Used in all FMS orders regardless of PIC code. Paragraph (e) 1 of clause provides inspection requirements". "DLAD 46.503: Use as needed to indicate origin inspection and acceptance points in solicitations and contracts for supplies".</p>
<p>C) The following clauses will be incorporate in the solicitation/contract:<br />Provision # 52.247-29 F.O.B. - ORIGIN<br />Fill-In Info: Vendor<br />Use in solicitations and awards when requesting F.O.B. Origin. It is Land and Maritime policy to obtain quotes on a F.O.B. destination basis for procurements below the simplified acquisition threshold whenever possible unless there are valid reasons to the contrary (e.g., sole source refusal). In determining whether offers are to be invited on f.o.b. origin or destination basis, or both, the primary consideration will be the selection of that delivery basis which will be most advantageous to the Government.<br />a. Solicitations generally will be on f.o.b. origin basis - (1) When overseas consignees above parcel post except for valid reasons (e.g., vendor's pricing policy includes cost of transportation to first CONUS destination). In this case, both the address applicable for parcel post shipments (FPO/APO) and the freight shipping address will be furnished in the order. (2) When destinations are tentative, (2) When diversions are anticipated, (3) When supplies are to move by premium transportation (IPD 01 through 03), or (4) When consolidation of small shipments can be made, (5) When weights are from 1 -150 lbs., IPD 01 - 08, a special low rate from FEDEX contract Worldwide Express (WWX) may be obtained and shipped direct overseas to the customer. b. Solicitations generally will be on an f.o.b. destination basis - (1) When CONUS consignees (including consolidation points) except for valid reasons as cited above. (2) When overseas consignees (FPO/APO) if item is within parcel post limitations (generally shipments of less than 70 pounds). In this case, vendor must be queried as to whether the parcel post limitations can be complied with. (3) When administrative delay and costs in evaluating origin offers would outweigh the potential advantage of a f.o.b. origin delivery basis. This is a matter of judgment to be based on circumstances of the individual acquisition as further outlined: (i) The obtaining of rates and computation of transportation costs for the evaluation of f.o.b. origin offers involves administrative costs and delays. Generally, for large purchases, 2 - 3 days are required to secure such data. This entails documentation on the part of the contracting officer, the DDC's transportation office, and MTMC; also, the cost of issuing and administering GBLs must be considered. For simplified acquisitions, transportation costs are given verbally, either by phone or email - no documentation needed, the same day. (ii) On the other hand, inviting offers on both a f.o.b. origin and f.o.b. destination basis may frequently result in savings in transportation costs. Such potential savings may be estimated based on past experience or informal advice. Buyers should consider special low rates available from FEDEX contract Worldwide Express (WWX) on f.o.b. origin basis only (see paragraph a 4 above) before awarding high priorities on a f.o.b. destination. (iii) All aspects should be considered including such factors as urgency of the acquisition; whether anticipated shipments clearly qualify for carload/truckload; in the case of multiple destinations, whether just one or several qualify for carload/truckload shipment, etc.<br />c. When export shipments are involved, solicitation will include M47C01, 52.247-9001, <br />PORT HANDLING AND OCEAN COSTS IN OFFER EVALUATION, which must be completed in accordance with guidance for the use of that provision.</p>
<p>Provision# 52.246-9006 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE - GOVERNMENT INSPECTION, ACCEPTANCE AND SHIPPING POINT (MAR 2013) DLAD<br />DLAD 46.503-90(b)(1) - Use this clause in solicitations and awards with F.O.B. origin delivery terms where Government quality assurance will occur at one or more locations other than the prime contractor's location.</p>
<p>Provision # 52.247-9056 ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.247-29, F.O.B. ORIGIN (SEP 2012) (FOB ORIGIN)<br />DLAD 47.305-95 - Use in solicitations and contracts to allow contractor to specify the shipping point. To be used in conjunction with F.O.B. Origin.</p>
<p>Provision# 52.247-1 COMMERCIAL BILL OF LADING NOTATIONS <br />FAR 47.107-4 - The contracting officer, in order to ensure the application of section 10721 rates, shall insert in solicitations and contracts when the contracts will be --<br />(a) Fixed-price f.o.b. origin contracts (other than contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold) (see 47.104-2(b) and 47.104-3).<br />(b) The contracting officer may insert in solicitations and contracts made at or below the simplified acquisition threshold when it is contemplated that the delivery terms will be f.o.b. origin.</p>

<DESC>Statement of Work (SOW)<br />Provision of Online Training Courseware and Materials
<p>Background<br />The US Department of State's Foreign Service Institute (FSI) is the bureau of record responsible for providing training opportunities in support of the Institute's mission. While the Institute supplies substantial coursework through its classroom offerings, it is impossible to meet the training needs of a worldwide population on-demand. Therefore, the Institute seeks to augment its classroom training with general online content as well as an additional virtual resource of textual materials, delivered via the Internet.</p>
<p>Under the Human Resources Line of Business (HR LOB) overseeing Human Resources Development (HRD), FSI has been designated as the preferred eLearning content provider for agencies requiring training content for the foreign affairs community. USAID is one such federal agency making use of these services in their solicitation for commercially-produced online training products.</p>
<p>Scope<br />The principal goal is to extend FSI's and USAID's reach by providing general online content which is to be used both within already-established training curricula as well as a supplement to each agency's custom online courses, in order to reach its extensive audience. It is not expected to in any way replace existing training offered by either agency.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />The primary objective is to provide contractor services and deliverables through the provision of general online content courseware (both FSI and USAID) and a set of virtual resources (USAID only) delivered via each agency's in-house learning management system. Such content offers training and study opportunities to employees whom, for financial and logistical reasons, may not be able to avail themselves of residential training at the Institute. In addition, it supports the provision of both industry-standard IT certifications, as well as professional certifications (see Appendix A).</p>

Amendment to cancel synopsis in its entirety

This solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Argon ST, Inc.  Newington, 8419 Terminal Road, Newington, VA 22122. The scope of this effort is to procure supplies, engineering, logistical and repair support of the WBR-2000 Electronic Support Measure System for the Littoral Combat Ship program.
  The period of the BOA is expected to be five years.  Periodic review and synopsis of the BOA will be performed at this activity.  Individual job orders will specify required tasks and all applicable delivery terms and conditions.  The proposed BOA will be issued on or about 21 August 2013.  All responsible sources may inquire into the specific terms and conditions included in the BOA; such inquiries will be considered by this agency.  Contact Karen Hammontree, Code CXNN via e-mail: Karen.Hammontree@navy.mil or by mail.  The complete mailing address is: Ms. Karen Hammontree, Code CXNN, Bldg. 2035, NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, 300 Highway 361, Crane IN 47522-5001.

This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c) (1) (a) (2) (iii) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The basis for restricting competition is: Argon ST designed, developed and manufactured the WBR-2000 ESM and holds key technical data and corporate knowledge that are unique to this system.  Procurement of systems and components, which are not form, fit and functionally interchangeable, would result in not only development costs but significant sustainment costs.  The solicitation will be available on or about 17 JUN 2013 at FedBizOpps located at http://www.fbo.gov and at Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.

No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed.
 Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. It is the responsibility of interested offerors to monitor FedBizOpps and/or NECO for any additional amendments that may be issued. Offers must be submitted in the format specified in the solicitation. Submitting a bid from the NECO website by clicking on Submit Bid does not guarantee offers will be received by the proper person in the correct format. It is the responsibility of the offeror to submit offers to the Point of Contact (POC) at NSWC Crane. The POC is Ms. Karen Hammontree, Code CXNN, email: Karen.Hammontree@navy.mil.

Reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.
 For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.

The intent of the updates is to better communicate the status of ongoing procurements within PEO STRI.  <br>  <br> Each PALT update session will provide Industry the opportunity to request updates on specific procurements of interest in a Question & Answer (Q&A type forum.

The Government will not provide any procurement sensitive information that would violate the integrity of the source selection process.  <br>  <br> Although minutes/notes for each session will not be provided, a document library has been created on STRIBOP for posting of miscellaneous briefings/presentations that may be provided during the PALT update sessions. These presentations can be accessed via the following link:  <br>  <br> https://bop.peostri.army.mil/sites/bop/PALT%20Update%20Session%20Briefings/Forms/AllItems.aspx  <br>  <br> New briefings will be posted to the document library within 3 business days after the applicable session.  <br>  <br>  <br> IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PARKING: Due to limited parking in the Partnership II/III parking lot, all visitors MUST park in the large parking lot on the corner of Science Drive and Technology Parkway.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source as this is a follow-on contract, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has awarded a sole source contract to LS3P Associates, LTD (LS3P).  This sole source contract is required for Architect-Engineering services for the completion of the design of Pope Holbrook Elementary School, Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The required completion date is 400 days from issuance of notice to proceed. <br>  <br> The 15% design effort for Pope Holbrook Elementary School has already been completed by LS3P, and will be used as the starting point for completing the rest of the design effort up to the final design. The contract used to award the 15% design was awarded as a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) with a base year and four (4) option years for Architect Engineering Support to the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), both CONUS and OCONUS, with a maximum capacity of $12,000,000. This contract has capacity remaining, but has expired.  The work will consist of performing the remaining Engineering, Design, and Support services necessary to complete the development and approval of construction plans and specifications for the Pope Holbrook Elementary School, Fort Bragg, North Carolina in strict compliance with the requirements included in the approved DD Form 1391 for the project and the 15% design already completed by LS3P. This action is to complete the required design to create construction level plans and specifications to allow award of a construction contract. LS3P will not perform work for any other project or program under this specific contract action. <br>  <br> The plans and specifications shall be prepared in accordance with the Department of Defense Education Association (DoDEA) 21st Century Educational Concepts, DoDEA Facility Education Specifications, local school district program requirements, the Fort Bragg design guide, the USACE design guide, and integration of the geographic conditions and site constraints. The design shall also include a comprehensive interior design package. The effort will include design review conferences at 35%, 65%, final, and design complete stages, as well as presentations to the DoDEA Design <br> Center and DoDEA Leadership at specified design intervals. An option for construction phase services in support of Pope Holbrook Elementary School is included in this contract. The construction phase services will enable the Designer of Record (DOR) to provide critical support throughout the construction process including, but not limited to, responding to request for information/support by the Resident Office overseeing construction, reviewing shop drawings, and performing site visits. Participation in the construction phase services will also enable the DOR to identify and capture lessons learned to be incorporated back into the programming and standard design specifications being developed by the DoDEA Design Center staff.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to fulfill the requirement of FAR 5.201.&nbsp; The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to issue a contract to the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) for the purchase of a membership to gain access to the Diesign Institute for Physical Property Data, a cooperative industrial and governmental effort dedicated to the compilation, measurement, and evaluation of physical property data for industrially-important chemicals. By participating in this unique partnership, NIST obtains access to state-of-the-art database technology, evaluated and experimental data on pure chemicals and mixtures, petrochemical and related industries.&nbsp; The Applied Chemicals and Materials Division of NIST seeks to procure Process Design Data Member Dues for 2014 from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), 3 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016-5991.&nbsp; The intent is to award to AIChE with a base year (1/1/2014 - 12/31/2014) and four one year option period at an estimated annual cost of $7500.&nbsp; Due to the proprietary rights to gain access to the database,&nbsp;there are no known sources other than AIChE from which to procure access to a database with compiled, measured, and evaluated physical property data for industrially-important chemicals.&nbsp; The estimated date of award of this action is 6/28/2013 with an effective date of 1/1/2014.
