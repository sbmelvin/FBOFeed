The following summary of work is for the purpose of general information and is not intended to include and describe every feature or item or to define the scope of work.  It is expected that the Contractor will visit the site of work and thoroughly familiarize himself with the conditions.
The intent of this project is for the necessary services, labor, material, equipment and control components required to provide, install, test and make operable a Battery Exchange System (BES) in Bldg 2001 at the Defense Distribution Depot Susquehanna, New Cumberland, PA.  The system shall include multi level racks with 2 changer vehicles equipped with battery pullers for side extraction and 2 cranes with hoists for overhead extraction, with one of each at each end of the BES.  Battery and charger racks must provide capability for chargers to be mounted above, beside or behind batteries, not below them.  Adequate space must be provided for air-cooling.  Chargers cannot be stacked more than three high.  The BES must be readily expandable.   The requirement also includes an Optional Battery and Charger Management System to provide a central server (Windows O/S, 17? flat screen monitor) running a relational database management system to facilitate flexible data acquisition and reporting.  The client/server computer architecture will be capable of simultaneously supporting multiple clients to accommodate future growth (400 batteries and 400 chargers minimum).  There shall be a Wireless communication between on-board changer vehicles and central server to assure continuous computer controlled battery handling with multiple racks supported via Ethernet or Fiber optic link.  An interactive, laptop-based demonstration of the Battery and Charger Management System shall be required to exhibit the full range of management reports, charts and tables that will be used to manage the battery exchange process.  The ability of the management system to perform custom search and sort functions on data, similar to an excel spread sheet, will be evaluated during this demonstration.  The NAICS code is 423830.  
Delivery shall be 180 days from date of contract award to final acceptance.

Currently, training at the National Police Training Academies, Camp Dublin focuses on maintaining the capability of the Emergency Response Unit (ERU), Provincial Special Weapons and Tactic (SWAT) Teams,  the personal security details of high-level governmental officials that are trained at the Center for Dignitary Protection (CDP), teaching the Iraqi National Police how to conduct the day to day Base Support Operations (BSO) necessary to maintain the camp after the transition of control to the Government of Iraq, and teaching certain leadership and select skill courses to members of the National Police as directed.  There are also cooperative training programs in place with the Ministry of Justice and United States Marshall Service to provide similar training as the needs occur.  The CPATT staff is also assisting with the stand-up of the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the National Police. In order to build the ERU Battalion capability, thirteen (13) Basic Crisis Response and five (5) Advanced Courses have been conducted as well as Leadership and Train the Trainer courses. The site has provided an ERU training and operational mentorship program that acts in an advisory capacity to the ERU Operating Companies.

By conducting a total of fifty-seven (57) Tier I and Tier II courses, this CPATT training site supported the creation of a high level government dignitary protection force for Iraq. The site provided a mentorship/advisor program for the Iraqi Tier 1 Dignitaries.  The Dignitary Protection Services (DPS) assisted in building skilled Iraqi Tier I PSDs who have assumed the responsibility of protecting the lives of their respective Principals, the DPS also functions as a liaison element for Multi National Forces Iraq Strategic Operations ? Protection (MNF-I STRATOPS), Multi National Forces Iraq Personal Security Coordination Cell (PSCC), Multi National Forces Iraq Joint Area Support Group (JASG), and CPATT.  Tier I dignitaries include but not limited to the President, two Vice Presidents, Prime Minister of Iraq and the Speaker of the Council of Representatives.

The training will not be limited to the Core Logistics Courses, Apprenticeship program and mentorship of trainees.  The Tier 1 Advisors will continue to function as mentors to the Tier 1 PSDs and as liaisons to MNF-I.  It should be noted that due to the restricted nature of the training and missions conducted from Camp Dublin that the awardees will not use the camp for an equipment staging or storage area and/or temporary billeting for personnel supporting other contract operations in the CENTCOM AOR.
