The Government intends to issue an award to a single SBA certified 8(a) concern under a firm fixed price contract on or about 21 Nov 2017. Services will be procured pursuant to the regulatory direction of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The expected award shall consist of one base period of performance (12 months, 1 Jan 2018 through 31 Dec 2018) and may include up to four optional periods of performance (each 1 year in duration, and running consecutively from the expiration of the base period of performance).

The BTS consists of the base telephone system switch, the outside plant (OSP) and inside plant (ISP) systems, network, transmission systems, and all associated equipment, which may include other systems (e.g. radio, etc.). The Contractor shall operate and maintain all BTS equipment and systems in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturers' (OEM) technical manuals and specifications, Department of Defense (DoD) and US Air Force (AF) policy and regulations, as well as all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.<br />The closing date and time for submission of offers shall be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation package shall be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Requests for copies of the solicitation package, or any cumulative parts thereof, by any other means shall not be honored. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 11 Aug 2017, for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and for downloading their own copy of each associative amendment, if any.<br />All firms wishing to submit a proposal subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database or risk their otherwise-timely proposal being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations. Information on SAM registration can be obtained at the following web site: http://www.sam.gov.<br />No response to this announcement is required. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. The solicitation subsequent to this announcement may be cancelled. After solicitation and prior to award the possibility exists to reject all offers when cancellation is clearly in the public interest. This announcement does not obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.<br />Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (Jun 2016), the following applies:<br />(a) an ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.

B.2  STATEMENT OF WORK

The                Medical Library at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center (LSCVAMC) is seeking a Contractor with established relationships with publishers to provide subscriptions and support services for serials, database subscriptions, e-book subscriptions, and point of care subscriptions. 
1.  SCOPE OF WORK
Contractor shall be responsible for the management, labor and equipment necessary to provide subscriptions and related services for journals, books, databases, e-books, e-journals, point-of-care and other related online services from multiple publishers to LSCVAMC. Related services include paying publishers, handling claims for non-receipt, cancellations, submission of required reports, electronic access services, and other service problems. The initial list of subscriptions can be found in Attachment A. Additional subscriptions may be added during the year. The majority of the subscriptions have a January 2018 start date.  
2. DEFINITIONS 
Back Orders: Orders that could not be filled by the supplier when originally placed are kept on file pending availability of the material. 
"Bill-Laters": A type of continuation in which a Contractor does not bill a library customer until the publisher has confirmed the price and/or availability of the item(s). 
Consignee: The location to which items are shipped. 
Contractor: The organization providing subscription services to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  For purposes of this solicitation, used interchangeably with Offeror. 
Database: A subscription service that assembles knowledge-based information from a variety of source types. These types can include any mixture of e-books, e-journals, drug information, patient handouts, news updates, and/or videos in any format or content in any type developed specifically for the database. Cross-searching across all of these sources is usually available.
 e-book: A book-length publication in digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, and produced on, published through, and readable on computers or other electronic devices.[1] Sometimes the equivalent of a conventional printed book, e-books can also be born digital. The Oxford Dictionary of English defines the e-book as "an electronic version of a printed book,"[2] but e-books can and do exist without any printed equivalent. e-books are usually read on dedicated hardware devices known as e-Readers or e-book devices. Personal computers and some cell phones can also be used to read e-books.
 e-journal: Electronic serials, are scholarly journals or intellectual magazines that can be accessed via electronic transmission. In practice, this means that they are usually published on the Web. They are a specialized form of electronic document, they have the purpose of providing material for academic research and study, and they are formatted approximately like journal articles in traditional printed journals.
Licensing: Terms and conditions required by the owners of proprietary systems, software or intellectual property regarding the terms of its use. 
Online Claiming: Computer-to-computer interactive communication to determine the current status of individual subscriptions, to register service complaints, and/or to 
facilitate communication between Library staff and Contractor. 
Periodical: A serial appearing or intended to appear indefinitely at regular or stated intervals, generally more frequently than annually, each issue of which is numbered or dated consecutively and normally contains separate articles, stories or other writings. Serials may be published in any medium or format (including electronic, print, microform, or other non-print media), and may be available through purchase (as with traditional print magazines) or license (as with online journals).   
Publisher Price: The established publisher's list price for the given subscription period at the time of order acceptance; the price at which a publication is made available to the public.  It is established by the publisher and is exclusive of any discount.  
Loosely, the price quoted by the publisher s catalog. 
Serial: A publication in any medium issued in successive parts bearing numerical or chronological designations and intended to be continued indefinitely. Serials include: periodicals, newspapers, magazines, annuals, yearbooks, journals, memoirs, 
proceedings, transactions, and numbered monographic series and other serially published works.  
Station: A VA Medical Center. 
Subscription: The term subscription, as used in this agreement, means a payment for access to or ownership of knowledge-based information, in a time limited or permanent access. It can take the form of access to online databases, e-books, e-journals, print journals, back file e-journals, and other related services. VA determines the subscription period, publisher permitting, and Contractors shall, for print subscription, place and service it for the life of the subscription plus three months. 
Supplemental Invoicing: Billing submitted, on a quarterly basis to cover bill-later titles, unscheduled issues for which publishers charge, etc.

<DESC><p>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for a five-year contract (one-year base period and four 1-year options) with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) of the Earth Institute at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. <br /><br />This requirement is for the continued development and operation of the Socioeconomic Data and Application Center Distributed Active Archive Center (SEDAC DAAC) for the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS,) pursuant to FAR 6.302-3, industrial mobilization; engineering; developmental or research capability; or expert services. <br /><br />Specifically, the SEDAC DAAC is part of an established program of scientific research, academic involvement and education outreach at the university. <br /><br />As an institutional element within EOSDIS, SEDAC was created provide products and services for policy formulation and decision making which combined Earth Science and socioeconomic data as well as improve the exchange of data and information between Earth Science and socioeconomic data users. To perform this function, SEDAC utilizes data from NASA's Earth Science research satellites as well as other Government and private sector programs. <br /><br />Using this data, SEDAC develops and manages geospatial data and information products which furthers understanding of&nbsp;the Earth as a system and enhances the interaction between scientific efforts at NASA and those at other agencies, as well as communication with the public and social science communities. <br />Finally, SEDAC works with other EOSDIS data centers, which provide operational data and information services for other disciplines and are a source of products that are useful for socioeconomic research applications. There can be no interruption in services to the current contract that expires July 31, 2018. <br /><br />The current sets of capabilities possessed by Columbia University are essential to NASA in that the combination of technological skills, scientific and theoretical knowledge and practical hands-on experience are necessary to operate and manage SEDAC. NASA requirements include the following: 1)Information and data system management, software and system development necessary to support the socioeconomic data and applications; 2)Sustaining and expanding the existing information gateway between Earth science and socioeconomic science communities; 3)Sustaining a granule-based inventory for socioeconomic data archived and distributed by SEDAC; 4)Ensuring the long-term integrity and viability of the data products SEDAC generates or holds; 5)Dataset acquisition and applications development to include documentation, guides, metadata, and incorporation into SEDAC holdings as well as populating the Common Metadata Repository (CMR), a repository of NASA Earth science Metadata; 6)Electronic distribution of data and products in formats consistent with the users needs, and; 7)User Services for SEDAC data products and for users attempting to overcome obstacles to analyses presented by the organization of the data. <br /><br />The Columbia University CIESIN facility is uniquely qualified to take the remotely sensed data from NASA satellites and combine it with socioeconomic data including population information and other statistical data gathered by governments and agencies around the world. The CIESIN is widely known for its expertise in acquiring socioeconomic data as well as complementary earth science datasets, processing and gridding this data to create higher level geospatial informational products, and managing and disseminating these data and products effectively and efficiently to the user community. <br /><br />This unique synthesis of earth science and socioeconomic datasets allows researchers and policy analysts to more fully understand the human dimensions impact of global climate change, both the impact of changes on populations and the impact of human populations on the climate system. <br /><br />CIESIN's socioeconomic science expertise and experience coupled with its data management expertise distinguish this Columbia University facility from other potential sources having data and information capabilities. The combination of the institutional elements with an active science community makes Columbia University a unique resource, both nationally and internationally, for socioeconomic research and data applications. <br /><br />A unique organizational strength of CIESIN is the number of prominent scientists in the field of socioeconomic science and applications working at the Center and the close affiliation with other national socioeconomic scientists on the SEDAC DAAC User Working Group. CIESIN has affiliated scientists that provide science leadership in&nbsp;the mission areas of Population, Land Use, and Emissions (PLUE,) Environmental Treaties and Resource Indicators (ENTRI,) socioeconomic Model Visualization and Analysis (MVA), Environment &amp; Health (EH,) Hazard Vulnerability Assessment (HVA,) Environmental Sustainability (ES,) Poverty &amp; Food Security (PFS,) and socioeconomic information useful for geospatial analyses and applications. <br /><br />The CIESIN has direct contact with a group of these research scientists who interact frequently on data management and data set priority issues. Further, NASA has affirmatively designated the SEDAC DAAC, among eight other discipline-specific data centers, to be the entity, which provides state-of-the-art data products for socioeconomic research. Without these skills, GSFC would be unable to meet needs of the EOSDIS in the area of socioeconomic research. No other institution was identified by GSFC to have similar experience and expertise. <br /><br />The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact, Rogenia M.B. Dean via email: Rogenia.M.Burton-Penderga@nasa.gov no later than November&nbsp;01, 2017 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. <br /><br />Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br />All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing via email to: Attn: Rogenia M.B. Dean, Email: Rogenia.M.Burton-Penderga@nasa.gov no later than October 25, 2017 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. <br /><br />Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is a Government effort in accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to conduct market research to support potential future planning initiatives through data collection. The Government is issuing this RFI in an effort to understand market availability, technical characteristics, and functionality of Information Technology (IT) tools, applications or products capable of satisfying the technical, functional, and/or operational capabilities described in this RFI.
<p>As a part of its life cycle management responsibility to provide enduring warfighting capability, the NC3I Directorate must ensure the NC3 Weapon System performs its function as designed. This requires the establishment of Secure Supply Chain (SSC) capability through rigorous application of the Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) processes to ensure all hardware, software, and firmware currently installed or planned to be installed into the weapon system are genuine (e.g. reliable, meet specs, come from approved source, etc.). The SCRM, as defined by DoD, is a systematic management process identifying susceptibilities, vulnerabilities and threats throughout DoD's "supply chain" and the development of mitigation strategies to combat those threats; whether presented by the supplier, the supplied product and its subcomponents, or the supply chain (e.g., initial production, packaging, handling, storage, transport, mission operation and disposal).</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet qualification requirements to repair the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Data Transfer Unit (DTU), NSN 7025-01-658-0455GC (Master); PN 30192-0501 or DTU NSN 7025-01-481-7741GC, P/N 30192-0201, Remote Data Concentrator (RDC), NSN 1680-01-500-6388GC, P/N 30201-0501 and the Control Display Unit (CDU), NSN 1680-01-533-8587GC, P/N 10150-024 which are components of the Integrated Vehicle Health Management System (IVHMS) installed on the HH-60G helicopter. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This requirement is for repair services. Our repair services strategy is a five-year contract (basic plus four option years) and will continue through FY24.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The projected quantities will be Best Estimated Quantities (BEQ) of 10 per year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government's needs for repair services are required in order to support current combat search and rescue operations. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The HH-60G aircrew's mission to rescue downed crewmembers in diverse and hostile combat environments as well as adverse, inclement weather conditions is vital. The IVHMS provides integrated health and usage management information that enhances aircraft safety by identifying and precluding premature component failure.</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HH-60G IVHMS </strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Collects and processes vibration and aircraft data, routes the data to the DTU for recording and the CDU for flight crew display. The RDC converts aircraft signal information from the junction boxes into a data stream that is sent to the IVHMU via an ARINC-429 bus interface (single line cable).</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Performance Requirements </strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">1. The repaired assets must not diminish the performance of the HH-60G. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">2. The repaired assets must meet MIL-STD-461F and MIL-STD-810G. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">3. The repaired assets must successfully pass current acceptance test procedures (ATPs). Any deviation must be approved by the H-60 Program Office (AFLCMC/WIU, SOF/PR and Rotary Program Office). </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">4. The Contractor must have access to the engineering drawings, repair tools, test equipment necessary to perform the repairs, testing, and troubleshooting of the asset. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">5. The Contractor must be ISO 9001 certified or at an equivalent level. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">6. The Contractor shall be expected to demonstrate that he/she has access to adequate repair capability to repair the IVHMS assemblies, the work planned for in-house accomplishments, and the work if any, to be outsourced.</span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The CDU allows the aircrew to view aircraft status, along with status messages alerting the aircrew to exceedances that may exist. It also provides recommended rotor, trim and balance adjustments, and is used to perform system Built-in-Test (BIT). </span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The DTU<strong> </strong>provides data transfer for the health and usage management system (HUMS) located on-board rotary winged aircraft. The DTU uses industry standard PCMCIA/FLASH memory cards that transfer data between the aircraft on-board system and ground based stations. The DTU operates under control of the HUMS main processor unit (MPU) to upload data to the HUMS MPU. </span></p>

<DESC>PURPOSE: The Program Executive Office Ground Combat Systems (PEO GCS) is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support requirements for industrial base assessments and studies. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. <br />BACKGROUND: Significant capability, capacity, and cost impacts are being placed on defense programs. These impacts could in the short term have dire consequences to manufacturers, resulting in major losses of critical industrial base sectors and suppliers along with potentially impacting core workload at depots and arsenals. PEO GCS and U.S. Army policymakers must develop overarching strategies that will sustain, preserve and retain the defense industrial base. <br /><br />SCOPE: PEO GCS is contemplating awarding multiple task orders for varying industrial base projects described below. The effort will involve extremely detailed and complex analyses through multiple layers of data, reports and studies held at a multitude of Original Equipment Manufacturers' (OEM's) sites, PEOs, arsenals, depots, other U.S. Army and Department of Defense (DOD) agencies, and the multiple tiered vendor bases supporting each of these organizations. The data gained from these requirements will provide the PEO and/or the U.S. Army with the ability to independently assess current state and reduce or prioritize the budget across the Army's industrial base. Areas of potential Government and/or industry assessment include but are not limited to the following:<br /><br />1. Strategic planning, program evaluation, monitoring and measurement<br />2. Assessments determining financial health, viability and competitiveness<br />3. Engineering Analysis, capabilities and risk of loss<br />4. Should cost training and development<br />5. Commonality studies<br />6. Assessments of facilities<br />7. Improvement Plans for Government and industry facilities<br />8. Reset of manufacturing production lines<br />9. Ameliorate facility shutdown, or facility efficient restart, or facility alternative production assessments<br />10. Labor skill assessments <br />11. Identification, retention and maintenance studies of critical labor categories<br />12. Cost, capacity, and capability assessments or affordability assessments<br />13. Current state assessments, bench marking, and scenario analysis<br />14. Supply, maintenance, logistics or Organic network strategies<br />15. Organic or supplier assessments<br />16. Studies on the impact of schedule and force structure across the industrial base<br />17. Strategies for program cost reductions, organization, processes, design affordability and acquisitions<br />18. Analysis of Alternatives<br />19. Identification of cost reduction opportunities to include material, labor, overheads, collaborative material sourcing, vendor deep dives, maintenance, commodity sourcing, affordability initiates, strategies and implementation plans<br />20. Government, OEM, vendor efficiency and/or effectiveness studies<br />21. Restructure, transformation and infrastructure assessments<br />22. Strategic sourcing assessments<br />23. Cost modeling or cost structures<br />24. Specification streamlining and analysis<br />25. Scenario analyses, network strategy planning, actionable recommendations, implementation plans, risk mitigation plans and communication plans.<br />26. Arsenal work loading <br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS: If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: <br /><br />1.

Background:

Currently the GPS units are submerged in a solid metal tank. Using a crane and lifting rig, the GPS unit is lowered into a tank and remains attached during the test. The metal tank is not designed for water testing and creates maintenance issues. The bubbles released during the test can be hard to see.

Contractor Requirements:

The contractor shall provide all parts, labor, tools and materials necessary to produce a sealed, clear acrylic, leak proof tank.

The tank shall be 36D x 40H minimum if cylindrical. Cylindrical is preferred. A rectangular tank shall be 36Lx36Wx40L. Access shall be at the top of the longest dimension.

The tank shall have a lid with handle that is capable of being removed if attached. The lid shall protect the water from dirt, dust, and debris.

There shall be a drainage port at the bottom of the tank that can accommodate a general hose pipe. The connection point shall extend at least 2 inches from the outside diameter of the vertical wall.

The tank shall have a base with locking, swivel casters with 2-4 of floor clearance. The base does not have to be removable. The tank plus base with casters shall not exceed 46H. The shop floor is tile covered with textured paint.

Contractor shall provide technical drawings, technical data information, and maintenance instructions for all parts.

3.7 Acceptance Testing: The tank shall arrive at Anniston Army Depot fully assembled and crated properly. There shall be no leaks, seals, cracks, crazing, scratches, pitting and/or hazing that may obscure vision of the GPS unit under test. Acceptance of work completed shall be done by the assigned Government Contracting Officers Representative (COR).

The Contractor shall provide a warranty for a period of not less than one (1) year.  The warranty shall begin the day following government acceptance of the upgrade described in this document.  During the warranty period, the contractor shall be responsible for all costs, including parts, labor, travel and lodging required to complete any and all repairs of any defects of material, parts and/or workmanship.  The warranty shall be written in the Anniston Army Depots name.

<RESPDATE>111617
<CONTACT>Jared Leisner, Email jared.s.leisner@nasa.gov
<DESC><br />1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary<br /><br /></span>
<p>Consistent with the 2013 Heliophysics Decadal Survey ("the Decadal Survey"), Solar and Space Physics: A Science for a Technological Society, NASA intends to form a Science and Technology Definition Team (STDT) to conduct a study of mission options, including new science and technology options, for its next major Living With a Star mission, Geospace Dynamics Constellation (GDC). This study will include an assessment and update of the science rationale for the mission and the provision of science parameters, investigation approaches, key mission parameters, and any other needed scientific studies.</p>
<p>In order to inform the STDT process, NASA seeks information from the broader scientific community. The requested information includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the GDC science goals, potential mission architectures, potential scientific instrumentation and/or measurements, and how GDC will fit into the larger Heliophysics System Observatory and can relate to missions flown by non-NASA organizations.</p>
<p><em>NASA particularly encourages the submission of responses on relevant scientific and technological discoveries, innovations, and advances that have been made since the Decadal Survey's publication.</em></p>
<p>2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></p>
<p>As recommended by the Decadal Survey, GDC is a mission with the primary objective to "characterize and understand how the ionosphere-thermosphere behaves as a system, responding to, and regulating, solar wind/magnetosphere energy input". The mission's primary science questions are (see pages 106-107 of the Decadal Survey):</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1.	How does solar wind/magnetospheric energy energize the ionosphere and <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>thermosphere?<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2.	How does the ionosphere-thermosphere system respond and ultimately modify <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>how the magnetosphere transmits solar wind energy to Earth?<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3.	How is solar wind energy partitioned into dynamical and chemical effects in the <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>ionosphere-thermosphere system, and what temporal and spatial scales of <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>interaction determine this partitioning?<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>4.	How are these effects modified by the dynamical and energetic variability of the <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>ionosphere-upper atmosphere introduced by atmospheric wave forcing from <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>below?</p>
<p>Due to the significant challenges in studying global dynamics with a single satellite, the Decadal Survey presented a nominal plan for GDC that consisted of six identical satellites in circular orbits at 300-450 km altitude and spread individually into equally spaced orbital planes separated by 30&deg; longitude. The satellites would nominally have an inclination of 80&deg;, in order to use precession to help separate the local time planes, while maintaining adequate coverage of the high-latitude region (illustrated in Figure 4.10 of the Decadal Survey).</p>
<p>In order to enable answering of the primary science questions, the Decadal Survey recommended that GDC measure the following key parameters (modified from Table 4.6 of the Decadal Survey):</p>
<p>Neutrals: Velocity, temperature, density, broad composition<br /> Ions: Velocity, temperature, density, broad composition<br /> Electrons: Three-dimensional energy distribution (0.05 eV to 20 keV)<br /> Fields: Vector magnetic field</p>
<p>3.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requested Response Topics</span></p>
<p>As part of the mission formulation process, NASA intends to convene an STDT in late 2017 to study the GDC concept. While the STDT will build on the recommendations given in the Decadal Survey, it will consider a broader set of options. It will be charged with conducting a mission concept study (or studies) and defining a design reference mission (or missions) for GDC. This charge will include an assessment and update of the science rationale for the mission and the provision of science parameters, investigation approaches, key mission parameters, and any other needed scientific studies.</p>

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>This Request of Information/Sources Sought is for Planning Purposes.</strong></div>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the Request for Information (RFI)/Sources sought notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>This request is issued for the purpose of exchanging information to improve the understanding of industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain services, at a reasonable cost/price, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.</p>
<p>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting information, on behalf of the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for Observer Support Services.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>NOAA Fisheries is the federal agency responsible for the management, regulatory compliance, economic data and protection of living marine resources within the United States Exclusive Economic Zone.  NMFS also plays a supportive and advisory role in the management of living marine resources in coastal areas under state jurisdiction.  It provides scientific and policy leadership in the international arena, and implements international conservation and management measures as appropriate.</p>
<p>NMFS has an extensive program to monitor and observe living marine resources and associated communities to provide information on biota, their habitats, and the human activities and actions that may impact coastal and ocean ecosystems.  Data are the foundation of scientific advice, which provides information to management to support decision-making.  A more consistent flow of high quality, credible information is required to improve decision-making.  To collect the quantity and quality of data necessary, NMFS intends to improve its capacity to conduct surveys and to conduct research and studies for a better understanding of ecosystems.  These efforts rely on extensive collaboration with fisheries participants and other stakeholders in the living marine resource decision process.</p>
<p>Observers are the only independent data source for some types of at-sea information such as bycatch composition and mortality, and marine mammal, sea bird and sea turtle interactions.  Although vessel self-reporting is often utilized, only limited data collection demands can reasonably be placed on the captain and crew.  In addition, the reliability of self-reported information is a concern for scientists and policy makers who use the data to make fishery management decisions for the purpose of maintaining the nation's marine resources.</p>
<p>Currently, more than 1,040 observers are deployed in 31 observer programs, most of which are administered through six (6) regional NMFS Fisheries Science Centers (FSC).  The NMFS observer programs are typically authorized by the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act.  The SEFSC currently conducts observer programs in the South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean, with over 70 observers deployed in the programs.  Specific observer programs include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Southeast Shrimp Trawl Observer Program - Year round program to collect observer data in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico on shrimp otter trawls (including rock shrimp fisheries), skimmer trawls, and other fixed gear.<br />&bull;	Atlantic Pelagic Longline Observer Program (including enhanced Bluefin tuna coverage) - Year round program to collect observer data in the Northwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean pelagic longline fisheries.<br />&bull;	Southeast Shark and Coastal Gillnet Observer Program - Year round program to collect observer data on Southeast shark and coastal teleost gillnet fisheries.<br />&bull;	Southeast Shark Bottom Longline Observer Program - Year round program to collect observer data on South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico directed large coastal shark bottom longline fisheries.<br />&bull;	Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Observer Program - Year round program to collect observer data on all fishing gears targeting reef fish.<br />&bull;	Gulf of Mexico Menhaden Observer Program - Conducted from April through November to collect observer data on menhaden fisheries (voluntary).<br />&bull;	Platform Removal Observer Program (PROP) - Year round program to protect sea turtles and marine mammals from underwater explosives used to remove oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>NMFS is required to collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance, and economic data for fisheries by placing observers aboard U.S. domestic fishing vessels.  This data cannot be obtained at the dock or on Government research vessels.  The data is needed for the management of fisheries occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas beyond the EEZ.</p>
<p>NOAA is seeking a Contractor to provide and retain the necessary qualified personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities (except as otherwise specified) to perform quality environmental, biological, and fisheries operations data collection, data analysis, and information dissemination for the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC).  Data quality is of the utmost importance.  Quality data collection, analysis, and dissemination are expected to increase the critical information gathered for stock assessments to manage the South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean species as well as protect sea turtles and marine mammals from underwater explosives used in the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent waters.</p>
<p><strong>The DOC/NOAA is seeking the following information:</strong><br />The Government requests capability statements from all businesses who qualify under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541715 (Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology).   Company size status for the NAICS Code stated above (small business concern per 13 CFR, educational institution, federal, local or state entity, commercial entity, nonprofit organization, etc.); and socio-economic status for NAICS Code stated above (i.e., 8(a), hubzone, small disadvantaged business, service-disabled/veteran owned, women owned, etc.).  The Contractor should also state if they currently hold a General Service Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS).</p>
<p>Note: Responses to this RFI are due no later th<strong>an October 25, 2017 at 12:00 P.M. Eastern.</strong> Responses shall be sent via e-mail to Julia Callahan, Contract Specialist, at julia.callahan@noaa.gov.  The electronic copy of your response must be in ".pdf format" and readable by the Adobe Acrobat Reader.  Questions pertaining to this notice may be emailed to julia.callahan@noaa.gov.  NO TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>The Government will not reimburse Contractors for any expenses associated with responses to this RFI, though the Government sincerely appreciates Contractor's efforts and input.  No federal funds have been implemented to fund any initiative discussed in this RFI.  In submitting a response, you are solely responsible and accountable for all of the expenses associated with your response.</p>

This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement, a market survey for information to be used for preliminary planning purposes. The information received will be used within the Navy to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency. The intent of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to identify potential qualified Small Businesses, U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) Businesses, SBA certified HUBZone Small Businesses, Economically Disadvantaged Women‐Owned Small Businesses, and/or Service‐Disabled Veteran‐Owned Small Businesses.

This Sources Sought Synopsis is one facet in the Governments overall market research in regards to whether the proposed solicitation will be issued as a competitive set-aside or as full and open (unrestricted).
 No procurement strategy will be determined based solely on the information received in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this market research.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest is seeking Small Business, SBA certified 8(a) Business, SBA certified HUBZone Small Business, Economically Disadvantaged Women‐Owned Small Business, and/or Service‐Disabled Veteran‐Owned Small Business sources with current and relevant experience, personnel, and capability to perform a multiple award construction contract for demolition projects.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237310 (Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction) with a Small Business Size Standard of $36.5 million.
  Task orders issued under the proposed multiple award contract(s) will be performed at various federal sites within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility (AOR) including, but not limited to, California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.  However, it is anticipated that most projects will be performed in the state of California.  The proposed contract will have a maximum performance period of five (5) years.  The estimated total contract price for the base year and all option years for all contracts combined is $499,000,000.  Task order range is estimated between $500,000 and $20,000,000. 

Projects will be primarily design-bid-build (fully designed) or secondarily design-build.
  Projects may include, but are not limited to, paving of airfield runway, taxiway, apron, and support areas for aircraft.  Note that, for the purposes of this announcement, excluded are 237310 NAICS definition project types that do not primarily involve construction of heavy duty pavement areas intended to support aircraft. 

Interested sources are invited to respond to this sources sought announcement by using the forms provided under separate file titled Sources Sought Information Forms.  Provide the following:
1) Contractor Information:  Provide your firms contact information, including DUNS number and CAGE Code.
2) Type of Business:  Identify whether your firm is a Small Business, SBA certified 8(a), SBA certified HUBZone, and/or SDVOSB concern.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has found that cleaners from different vendors within the same cleaner category have a wide range of technical characteristics thereby requiring different shipboard storage locations. NAVSEA and Naval Supply Command (NAVSUP) have also found that vendors are directly soliciting products to U.S. Navy ships in violation of U.S. Navy policy (OPNAVINST 5100.19E). Lastly, the process to approve general use cleaning products for U.S. Navy shipboard use differs from the process to approve other hazardous materials (HAZMAT). To remedy these issues, NAVSEA developed commercial item descriptions (CIDs) in conjunction with NAVSUP and General Services Administration (GSA). The CIDs standardize the salient characteristics of cleaning products, notably pH range, flash point, and constituent chemicals in order to ensure compatible stowage of products within a category. Environmental requirements, such as aquatic toxicity, are also applied to ensure the U.S. Navy remains a good steward of the environment. The CIDs were divided into three groups.
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis is to issue a Request for Information to identify vendors and products which comply with all requirement set forth in the Group 1 CIDs identified below, and potential sources of supply for each CID. The CIDs are provided in Attachments A-O. Information submitted to the RFI will be reviewed by NAVSEA and vendors/products found to be compliant with the CIDs and with acceptable shipboard units of issue will be forwarded by NAVSEA to GSA for establishment of National Stock Numbers.</p>
<p>The Group 1 CIDs apply to the following General Purpose Cleaner categories: Air Freshener, Carpet Cleaner, Dishwasher Descaler, Hand Dishwashing Detergent, Disinfecting Wipes, Foam Hand Soap, Furniture Polish, Hand Sanitizer, Borax Hand Soap, Liquid Hand Soap, Metal Polish, Oven Cleaner, Pre-soak Cleaner, General Purpose Ready-to-use Detergent, and Waterless Hand Cleaner.</p>
<p>The NSNs established under this process will be added to the Navy's Ships' HAZMAT List (SHML) and be approved for use aboard U.S. Navy ships. All other NSNs on the SHML falling into the Group 1 CID categories will be removed from SHML and prohibited from use onboard U.S. Navy ships. <br />It is also important to note that NSNs established during this CID process are not vendor specific. Multiple vendors may share a NSN. GSA will select a source using their established solicitation process.</p>
<p>Instructions for specific information to be provided in the response are provided under the attachment titled "Sources Sought Submission Instructions."</p>
<p>Sources Sought for both Group 2 and Group 3 General Purpose Cleaner categories will be issued at a later date. CIDs for the following Group 2 General Purpose Cleaner categories will be issued once a universal concentrate dispenser is identified and approved by NAVSEA: Floor Stripper, Glass Cleaner, Concentrated Heavy Duty Cleaner, and Non-food Contact Disinfectant. CIDs for the following Group 3 General Purpose Cleaner categories will be issued once a galley suitable dispenser system is identified and approved by NAVSEA and the Navy Exchange Service Command (NEXCOM): Machine Dishwashing Detergent, Dishwasher Rinse Additive, and Food Contact Cleaner. Products submitted which fall into a Group 2 or Group 3 CID category will not be considered under this RFI.</p>

Since 2012, and through 5 rounds of CIP, NREL has executed subcontracts that are intended to target these program objectives and increase the competitiveness of U.S. wind turbine technologies in the expanding global market for distributed energy systems. In July, 2017, North American Clean Energy published an article (http://www.nacleanenergy.com/articles/27632/doe-s-competitiveness-improvement-projects-are-delivering-substantial-cost-reductions-in-the-u-s-distributed-wind-industry) featuring the many successes achieved by previous CIP awardees.</p>
<p>Building on prior successes, in 2017 five separate RFPs were released under "Distributed Wind Turbine Competitiveness Improvement Project - Round 5". These RFPs included the topic areas referenced below:<br />Component Improvement and Overall System Optimization - Round 5<br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOE/NREL/NR/RGZ-7-70164/listing.html</p>
<p>Manufacturing Process Upgrades - Round 5<br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOE/NREL/NR/RGZ-7-70165/listing.html</p>
<p>Prototype Testing - Round 5 <br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOE/NREL/NR/RGZ-7-70167/listing.html</p>
<p>Certification Testing (&lt;200m2 RSA) - Round 5<br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOE/NREL/NR/RGZ-7-70166/listing.html</p>
<p>Type Certification &gt;200m2 and 1000m2 RSA) - Round 5<br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOE/NREL/NR/RGZ-7-70204/listing.html</p>
<p>No assumption should be made regarding the specific topic areas for any future competitive solicitations based on the past solicitations provided. The RFPs planned for 2018 will again include cost share requirements. Offerors should anticipate needing to demonstrate active engagement in the U.S. market, have links to the U.S. supply chain, demonstrate strong team skills and capabilities, and provide detailed financial information.</p>
<p>In advance of the release of the 2018 RFPs, NREL will host an informational CIP workshop at the National Wind Technology Center outside of Boulder, Colorado. This workshop will be held Wednesday, December 6 and will cover a number of topics including a review of the common topics of previous CIP solicitations, merit criteria for proposal reviews, design evaluation requirements, and testing and certification standards. Additional topics may be added. The workshop also affords an opportunity to meet with other members of the distributed wind community. Attendees will also be encouraged to provide feedback on the CIP and the focus of potential future solicitations. The workshop will provide the option to participate in person or via webinar. Registration is required for attendance and is available at: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/competitiveness-improvement-project-workshop-tickets-38086287110.</p>
<p>To be placed on a list to receive the RFPs when they are released, please contact Procurement Office Subcontract Administrator Kyndall Jackson at Kyndall.Jackson@nrel.gov.</p>

This is NOT a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this announcement.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Solicitation Number: W58RGZ-18-R-1103<br />Agency: Department of the Army<br />Office: Army Contracting Command<br />Location: ACC-RSA - (Aviation)<br />Notice Type: Request for Information</p>
<p>Synopsis:<br />The U.S. Army Utility Helicopters Project Office (UHPO) is seeking potential sources that currently possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to develop an improved method for detecting loss of nitrogen pressure in UH/HH-60A/L Black Hawk helicopter Main Rotor Blades through process improvements, material/design improvements to the current pressure indicator, and/or a complete redesign of the indication system. This notification is a Request for Information (RFI) only to support Market Research for obtaining the latest industry information.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The current pressure indicator is installed on the back wall of the spar at the root of the main rotor blade. The current design gives the maintainer a visual cue if the blade becomes unserviceable. The indicator compares a reference pressure built into the indicator with the pressure in the main rotor blade spar. When the pressure in the blade spar is within the required service limits, indicating the blade is serviceable, the spar pressure inspection method will give the maintainer a visual cue that the main rotor blade is serviceable. If the pressure in the blade spar drops below minimum permissible service pressure, the spar pressure inspection method will provide the maintainer a visual cue that the main rotor blade is in an unserviceable condition.<br /><br />The current pressure indicator is a significant system degrader with respect to reliability and maintainability. The primary failure modes or reasons for maintenance include: False readings, corrosion and leaking. The USG currently sustains the Pressure Indicator through competitive overhaul and repair contracts from multiple contractors both Government and commercial.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions:<br />Submissions from industry should include both design and sustainment concepts that would improve the current pressure indicator performance and provide a cost effective strategy for repair and overhaul capabilities or identify potential alternatives for the current pressure indicator. These concepts should include but not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull;Key design characteristics that will provide enhanced reliability<br />&bull;A path to Government purpose rights of a level 3 technical data package<br />&bull;Organic Depot Repair capability<br />&bull;Level of Repair Analysis for primary failure modes<br />&bull;Storage and Transportation requirements/limitations</p>
<p>Any interested party shall provide a written response NLT 30 days from the date of RFI posting. The written response shall be limited to 15 pages and shall include the following information:</p>
<p>(1)Offeror's names, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address.</p>
<p>(2)Offeror's Business Type and Business Size (whether HUB Zone, Service Disabled, Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), large business or small business).</p>
<p>(3)Current Market Pricing which meets the definition in IAW FAR 2.101.</p>
<p>(4)Description of proposed product to include estimated weight, timeframe availability, diagrams/sketches/drawings/schematics and existing product qualifications/certifications and reliability.</p>
<p>The response date for this market research is November 17, 2017. No collect calls will be accepted. All responses to this RFI may be submitted via e-mail to Emily Crittenden, Contracting Officer, at emily.a.crittenden2.civ@mail.mil, courtesy copy to Josh Flinn, Contract Specialist, at joshua.e.flinn.civ@mail.mil,and with a hard copy to the U. S. Army Contracting Command, Building 5303 Martin Rd., Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898.</p>
<p>The information provided in this RFI is for informational purposes only. It shall not be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to solicit for or award a contract. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse any expenses incurred by responding to this RFI. Any responses received will be treated as information only and shall not be used as a proposal.</p>

<DESC>PLA SYNOPSIS:<br />The Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements, (PLAs), for a large scale construction contract, (exceeding $100 million) for the following project:
<p>Project Description: Construct Airman Training Complex Dormitory #5 and ATC #6 and Dining/Classroom Facility #3</p>
<p>Project Location: Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) - Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas</p>
<p>Summary: Construct two ATC dormitories of approximately 280,000 GSF each and a Dining/Classroom Facility #3 of approximately 105,000 GSF. Each ATC dormitory houses 1,248 basic military trainees (BMT) and the DCF dining/classroom supports two ATC dormitories with a full service kitchen, two serving lines and 16 120-person stadium seating classrooms.</p>
<p>Description of Proposed Construction: This request for proposal (RFP) is a design-bid-build (DBB), full and open competition contract for construction which includes the fifth of potential eight dormitories and the third of potential four dining/classroom facilities. This project provides for the construction of a 1,248 person basic military training (BMT) dormitory and a dining/classroom facility that supports two BMT dormitories. The dormitory is approximately 280,550 GSF, four stories, reinforced concrete structure, single elevator, clad with pre-cast concrete panels and provided with a standing seam metal roof. Supporting facilities include a free standing Equipment Building to house the mechanical equipment and a Weapons Cleaning Pavilion, running track, exercise pads, parking lots, AT/FP low security wall with integrated street lights and landscaping/irrigation. The dining/classroom facility is approximately 106,537 GSF, three stories with the first floor consisting of a full service commercial kitchen, dining area, support spaces, the second and third floors consist of eight 120-person classrooms with stadium seating each with supporting spaces per floor. The dining/classroom facility is to include structural steel frame on a pre-cast first floor, single elevator, clad with pre-cast concrete panels and be provided with a standing seam metal roof. Supporting facilities include parking lots, AT/FP low security wall, loading dock and landscaping/irrigation. Special foundations to support this new dormitory and dining/classroom facility will be required. Both the dormitory and dining/classroom facility will include building information system, intrusion detection system, energy monitoring and control system, fire/smoke detection and alarm system and connections to installation central systems. Supporting facilities include water, sewer, gas, and electric utilities, exterior communications, site drainage and final grading. Access for individuals with disabilities will be provided. In addition, the successful offeror will be required to establish the ATC West Campus construction "Free Zone" construct a temporary construction haul road to access the ATC #5 dormitory and DCF #3 dining/classroom facility construction site.</p>
<p>DFAR 236.204 Disclosure of the magnitude of construction projects. Range of Magnitude: Between $100,000,000 and $250,000,000. Period of Performance: 1030 calendar days after notice to proceed, estimated.</p>
<p>PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy Subpart 22.503:</p>
<p>a.) Project Labor Agreement, (PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b.) An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p>1.) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and...</p>
<p>2.) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br />a.) The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br />b.) The complexity of the project.<br />c.) Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d.) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br />e.) The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br />f.) The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g.) The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. h.) Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reference FAR Provision: 52.222-33 "Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement" and FAR Clause: 52.222-34 Alternate I (May 2010) "Project Labor Agreements."</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLA's. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a.) Should PLA's be executed on this selected large dollar contract at JBSA - Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?</p>
<p>b.) Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c.) Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d.) Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e.) Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f.) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g.) Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h.) Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the Lackland, San Antonio, Texas area?</p>
<p>i.) Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential Offerors and/or subcontractors to meet their Small Business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Note: For yes or no answers, please provide a supporting narrative.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via email ONLY to: vernon.valigura@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 31 October 2017 Central Time 10:00 AM.</p>

<DESC><p>This is not a request for proposal (RFP). It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by respondents is strictly voluntary. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market research knowledge. Subsequent to this RFI, a Pre-solicitation notice will be posted IAW FAR 5.203(a).</p>
<p>United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Directorate of Procurement intends to solicit and negotiate solely with Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), 444 Saloman Circle, Sparks, NV 89434-9651. Considering SNC's Tactical Radio Application eXtension (TRAX) and Android TRAX (ATRAX) products are the only integrated Air / Ground tool that implements coded waveforms to Bi-Direction Translation of Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and IP Cursor on Target (CoT) that have been tailored for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use on the battlefield objective; it is the only product currently validated as fully interoperable with the Hand Held Link 16 radio and the Digitally aided Close Air Support Gateway-SOF (DACASG-S) as displayed through multiple joint exercises. TRAX supports specific message translations required by SOF and is the only product certified by the Joint Interoperability Test Center and approved for use for irregular warfare. Entertaining procurement of a like capability during deployment of the TRAX in a combat theater would require extensive duplication of effort related to integration and developmental and operational testing, disrupting combat operations and greatly extending the time to deliver capability to the warfighter by 18-24 months. As the sole developer of TRAX software, only SNC can provide the appropriate software upgrades and level of services and support required for the product such as software patching, upgrade, support installation, integration, training, exercise support, as well as planning, engineering, integration, and software support without a service gap or significant duplication of costs. The specific support requirements include the following six standard support tasks:</p>
<p>1. Software Assurance - Track and validate a list of bug fixes, confirm version compatibility, perform configuration management, and ensure version control. The contractor shall work to identify and repair all bugs associated with TRAX/ATRAX. Areas to be tracked include: application access, navigation, functionality, inputs and outputs. Issues may be in the form of both compatibility and bug fixes. The contractor shall research and document all items and in the case of reports of bugs, will attempt to replicate/validate. The contractor will ensure TRAX/ATRAX compatibility with supported operating system.</p>
<p>2. Software Maintenance - Provide tested revisions of TRAX (v)2.x, ATRAX (v)1.x, and any version upgrades.</p>
<p>3. Help Desk Support - Maintain a full-time help desk technician to answer questions via phone and email. The help desk technician shall provide level-one guidance via phone and email in an effort to resolve user issues as soon as possible during business hours. Help desk will ensure that the Support Server is operational with minimal down time, and that authorized users can easily navigate to the most up to date information and software updates. The help desk shall be responsible for tracking trouble tickets and following up resolutions. The help desk shall identify mid to high-level user issues and coordinate for higher level support. Help desk technicians shall maintain help desk equipment and associated media to reflect best practices. Help desk metrics shall be provided.</p>
<p>4. Field Support-Training - Shall maintain a dedicated training team consisting of two personnel experienced with the TRAX/ATRAX software and operational usage. TRAX/ATRAX classes shall consist of a 5-day course of instruction with two instructors per course. Courses shall be tailored to support specific customer usage and reflect most current tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as well as software revisions. TRAX/ATRAX trainers shall update all related training material. The training team shall provide a syllabus along with thorough instruction of TRAX/ATRAX configuration as well as SADL/ Small Tactical Terminal (STT) radio networking, configuration, and troubleshooting. The Government will provide all required peripheral equipment such as radios, crypto, computers, class location, etc. If possible, training courses shall be scheduled in conjunction with ongoing events such as close air support(CAS)/Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) training events (during last day) to best illustrate data link usage and added value to specific mission sets.</p>
<p>5. Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) and Joint Staff J6 (JITC/JS J6) Collaboration - <br />Shall collaborate with JITC/JS J6 as necessary to achieve requested JITC/JS J6 certifications. Program personnel shall work with JITC/JS J6 to establish test criteria and plans, perform tests, and review test results. Shall make required revisions to TRAX/ATRAX in a timely manner to be tested as required. JITC/JS J6 support includes four 7-day Continental United States (CONUS) collaboration trips to be used for coordination and interoperability certification events. Shall collaborate with JITC/JS J6 and make all necessary revisions to achieve and maintain requested JITC/JS J6 certifications.</p>
<p>6. Field Support - Exercises - Shall provide three TRAX/ATRAX program personnel to support exercise and demonstration events. These personnel shall be available to assist in low to mid-level TRAX/ATRAX integration such as Joint Operations Center (JOC) and computer system TRAX/ATRAX setup. Low to mid-level integration means that TRAX/ATRAX do not need to be altered, it only requires configuration for unit specific mission set. Shall coordinate with the end user to establish the details of each support event. Shall utilize the most up to date TTPs for related software and TTPs regarding the user's specific mission set. Shall support a minimum of 8 exercises each year.</p>
<p>Upon the Government's request, the following three additional support tasks are needed:</p>
<p>1. Complex Integration Support - Shall support TRAX/ATRAX and new technology demonstrations during CONUS training events/demonstrations upon request of USSOCOM. Shall work with USSOCOM to establish scope and additional funding requirements for all aircraft demonstrations. Aircraft demonstrations can be used to both support training exercises in an ISR role, as well as demonstrate new technology. Upon request, shall provide a cost estimate/rough order of magnitude (ROM) to support technology demonstration events. Shall utilize a leased aircraft that is capable of supporting events as well as coordinate for pilot support. Events shall require one week of integration time prior to the event. It is an assumption that all Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) [i.e. sensor, radios, video downlink (VDL), workstation, etc.] will be provided as GFE by the Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (MARSS) ISR program and any additional required technology shall be provided as GFE from supported unit [i.e. Wave Relay, STT, Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS), etc.] prior to integration.</p>
<p>2. Aircraft Demonstrations - Support the software and new technology demonstrations during CONUS training events/demonstrations upon request of USSOCOM.</p>
<p>3. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Support - Shall support TRAX/ATRAX in Outside CONUS (OCONUS) locations as requested. Upon request, shall provide a cost estimate/ROM to support training and integration overseas. Shall provide the cost for a five-day training course at the specified location. The user will provide all peripheral equipment such as computers and radios and the contractor will provide instruction and syllabus. Shall perform low to mid-level integration at overseas locations such as operation centers and vehicles. Low to mid-level integration does not require changing TRAX/ATRAX, but the configuration of TRAX/ATRAX for specific platforms.</p>
<p>Per FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement that will be considered by the agency. Any party responding to this notice shall send clear, factual documentation demonstrating their capabilities to meet this requirement to the Government no later than Wednesday, November 1, 2017 12:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. E-mail statements will be accepted; however, responders are responsible for ensuring the complete transmission and timely receipt. All inquiries to this RFI notice shall be sent via e-mail to david.tenenbaum3@socom.mil and ashley.commiso@socom.mil.</p>

With exception of the Aircraft OEM, a capable vendor must be deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore must be a FAA Certified Service Facility, and/or an OEM approved distributor facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM Data required to complete the commercial buy, and be able to certify the accessories and parts are for the HC-144 (CN-235). Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond. This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their quote for capability determination or for registration in WWW.SAM.GOV . If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS item managers and engineering, vendors who believe they would otherwise qualify based on the aforementioned criteria are encouraged to contact Mr. David Allen (252)335-6501 for a capability evaluation and determination toward future awards consideration. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 366413. The Coast Guard intends to issue a firm fixed price purchase order to the Aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for spares as follows: <br /><br />1.

<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a security upgrade project at the Carol Stream IL P&amp;DC located at 500 Fullerton Ave, Carol Stream IL 60199-9080. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $1,100,000 to $1,500,000 with construction completion within 365 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1)Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation. USPS does not exempt suppliers from licensure for federal projects unless indicated otherwise in the solicitation. <br />(2)Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3)Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4)Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.<br />(5)Company must submit information for three comparable buildout projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $750,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2 of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE USPS CAROL STREAM IL P&amp;DC ON WEDNESDAY AUGUST 23, 2017, AT 10:00 A.M. CDT LOCATED AT 500 FULLERTON AVE, CAROL STREAM IL. 60199-9080. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Thomas Pio, Thomas.M.Pio@usps.gov or Paige Lyne, Jacquelyn.P.Lyne@usps.gov or James Cooley, James.A.Cooley@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon Eastern Time on August 31, 2017.</p>
<p>Submit proposals via Emptoris, the USPS esourcing venue, registration in EMPTORIS is required. Registration instructions are included.<br />The link https://uspsprod.emptoris.com For help with the eSourcing program, please contact the USPS eSourcing at esourcing@usps.gov or call 1-800-332-0317, options 4 and 5.

Upon award, the name of the successful offeror and the amount of the contract will be released as public information. The names of offerors and the amount of their offers will not be released as public information. This information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, Exception 4.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. (End of clause)</p>

<p>NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to joel.heisler@noaa.gov no later than 1700 hrs PST, October 24, 2017.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Joel Heisler at (541) 867-8736 or joel.heisler@noaa.gov  for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options.

<p>(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards.</p>
<p>(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The<br />Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>

<p>(i) Cloud computing services shall be subject to the security requirements specified in the clause 252.239-7010, Cloud Computing Services, of this contract.</p>
<p>(ii) Any other such IT service or system (i.e., other than cloud computing) shall be subject to the security requirements specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(2) For covered contractor information systems that are not part of an IT service or system operated on behalf of the Government and therefore are not subject to the security requirement specified at paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the following security requirements apply:</p>
<p>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered contractor information system shall be subject to the security requirements in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br />Special Publication (SP) 800-171, ``Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations'' (available via the internet at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171) in effect at the time the solicitation is issued or as authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(C) If the DoD CIO has previously adjudicated the contractor's requests indicating that a requirement is not applicable or that an alternative security measure is equally effective, a copy of that approval shall be provided to the Contracting Officer when requesting its recognition under this contract.</p>
<p>(D) If the Contractor intends to use an external cloud service provider to store, process, or transmit any covered defense information in performance of this contract, the Contractor shall require and ensure that the cloud service provider meets security requirements equivalent to those established by the Government for the Federal Risk<br />and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate baseline (https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/) and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and<br /><br />protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment.</p>
<p>(3) Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2)<br />of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate special circumstances (e.g., medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These measures may be addressed in a system security plan.</p>
<p>(c) Cyber incident reporting requirement.</p>
<p>(1) When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractor's ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, the Contractor shall--</p>
<p>(i) Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractor's network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractor's ability to provide operationally critical support; and</p>
<p>(ii) Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.</p>
<p>(2) Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required elements at http://dibnet.dod.mil.</p>
<p>(3) Medium assurance certificate requirement. In order to report cyber incidents in accordance with this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall have or acquire a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate to report cyber incidents. For information on obtaining a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate, see http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/Pages/index.aspx.</p>
<p>(d) Malicious software. When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center<br />(DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer. Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e) Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.</p>
<p>(f) Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.</p>
<p>(g) Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent</p>
<p>practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.</p>
<p>(i) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD--</p>
<p>(1) To entities with missions that may be affected by such information;</p>
<p>(2) To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, or mitigation of cyber incidents;</p>

<p>(4) For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in the program at 32 CFR part 236); or</p>
<p>(5) To a support services contractor (``recipient'') that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information.</p>
<p>(j) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the Government's use and release of such information.</p>
<p>(k) The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.</p>
<p>(l) Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable<br />clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>(m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall--</p>
<p>(1) Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The<br />Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and</p>
<p>(2) Require subcontractors to--</p>
<p>(i) Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(ii) Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.<br /><br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><br />(1) [ <br /><br />] Are, [ <br /><br />] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for<br /><br />the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p><br />(2) [ <br /><br />] Have, [ <br /><br />] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a<br /><br />civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p><br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>(2) [ ] Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p><br />(1) [</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This document is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.

 The evaluation of offers received in response to the solicitation will use a tiered or cascading order of precedence.  Tiered evaluation of offers,  also known as  cascading evaluation of offers,  is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when market research is inconclusive for justifying limiting competition to small business concerns or sub-categories of small business concerns. The contracting officer  
(1) Solicits offers from both small and other than small business concerns that will be evaluated in the following tier order: 
(a) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB); 
(b) veteran-owned small business (VOSB); 
(c) all other small business concerns; 
(d) other than small business. 
(2) If an award or a sufficient number of awards cannot be made at the first tier, evaluation of offers will proceed at the next lower tier until an award or a sufficient number of awards can be made. 
 
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit. Interested persons may submit offers, and all eligible offers received prior to 1:00 PM PDT October 27th, 2017 will be considered by the Government. The NAICS code is 339113 and the size standard is 750 Employees. 
This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-89 effective, July 14, 2016.
Products shall be supplied in accordance with the specifications, terms and conditions contained herein. In addition, the following FAR and VAAR clauses will also apply. Thank you.

C.1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

Only electronic offer will be accepted. Offers are due by 1:00 PM PDT October 27th, 2017.

Alternate system submission: Offerers submitting alternate items must provide technical information sufficient for a lay person to determine acceptability. Information will not be paid for by the government nor returned to the supplying party. The information will be used to determine product acceptability. Lack of sufficient information for our staff to determine product acceptability will result in a negative determination.  Any quote will then be found non­responsive to the solicitation and the quote will not be considered.

New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured, used/refurbished or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. No product in development shall be considered.

Authorized dealers: Experienced firms only who are authorized dealers will be considered in addition to the original equipment manufacturer. A letter from the manufacturer stating your company is an authorized dealer for the line items must be in possession by the due date and be available for submission, if requested.

FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)
  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price
and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:
  The Government will award to the lowest price, technically acceptable offeror. Brand name or equal. 
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Synopsis: 
COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Brand Name or Equal commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
Solicitation number 36C10G-18-Q-0004 is issued for this combined synopsis/solicitation; this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-94 and 2005-95, both dated 19 Jan 2017.
Requirement Description:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is transforming the service it provides to Veterans through the MyVA effort.  MyVA was established in July 2015 to modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs  culture, processes, and capabilities to put the needs, expectations and interests of Veterans and their families first.  This effort is highly visible, with significant attention within the highest levels of government, the public, and the press. 
As this transformation progresses, VA's mission requirements to support America s Veterans are growing more quickly than its budget.  Key elements of VA s expanded mission requirements include:
15% expansion in the number of Veterans enrolled in VA Healthcare from FY 2009 through FY 2016
More than 100% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016  in the number of 100% disabled Veterans cared for by VA
6% increase in the number of medical appointments scheduled in FY 2016 vs FY 2014
More than 300% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016 in the number of Veterans receiving education benefits through the VA
In order to ensure we are able to continue to provide Veterans with the benefits and care they have earned through their selfless service, VA is changing the way we do business.  Specifically, we are improving the management of our supply chain to aggregate demand and facilitate ease of ordering in the field.  Throughout VA, we are moving from local contracting to national contracting whenever feasible.  Simplified ordering processes will drive volume towards suppliers with national contracts.  Simultaneously, greater cost transparency throughout the VA will allow clinicians and VA leaders to select medical equipment that optimizes Veteran outcomes at the lowest cost.
For our suppliers, we anticipate that these changes will ease the process of doing business with the VA and drive down our suppliers  costs.  We welcome opportunities to work closely with suppliers to further reduce costs.  In return, we expect that suppliers will offer the VA value commensurate with VA s status as the largest integrated healthcare provider in the United States.  Specifically, VA expects that it will receive the most favorable prices, warranties, conditions, benefits, and terms for the same product as those given by the supplier to any provider in the country.  We expect that VA s large volumes will increasingly be directed toward those suppliers best able to offer value to the VA.  VA looks forward to collaborating with its suppliers to further drive down costs in order to deliver optimal value to our Veterans.
In light of this transformation, the VA has a requirement to purchase General Electric (GE) Aerobic: Treadmills (later referred to as  Treadmills ) or equal to deliver patient care at its VA Medical Centers throughout the United States, U.S. Territories, Guam and the Philippines.  Treadmills are designed to simulate walking forward with a moving strip in which one walks, jogs or runs without moving forward.  Treadmills are a device used to maintain physical fitness and for medical examination or physical treatment.  It is also an essential component of the exercise treadmill test, a stress test for heart disease.  These exercisers are usually self-powered devices.  They may use wheels, or friction belts, with increase resistance and incline.  Treadmills are a device having an endless belt on which an individual walks or runs in place that is used for exercise and in tests of physiological functions.  Some treadmills may include a motor to regulate speed. The treadmills usually include workout program modes that can adjust resistance and a monitor to display the workout time, distance, speed, calories burned, and heart rate; they often have handlebars with grip pulse sensors, and some treadmills have heart-rate controls that can adjust the resistance level to suit the targeted heart rate.  Treadmills are intended to increase cardiovascular endurance by keeping the heart and pulmonary rate elevated for a continuous period.  Additionally, they provide strength and endurance to upper body, endurance lungs and the lower-limb muscles (e.g., quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, and gluteus).

<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p><br />252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart<br />204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit price Amount<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>5152.233-4000 HQ AMC LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM (FEB 2014)</p>
<p>Prior to submitting an agency protest, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve your concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.

CLARIFICATIONS 

QUESTION
The confusion I am having on these are the six seater being covered all the way around.  Typically the setup is four front facing seats that are covered, but the back two are rear facing and are not covered.  With the heat request, is it only for the four seats front facing?  There would not be a cover or heat on the back two seats, would this be an acceptable setup?

ANSWER/CLARIFICATION
Correct there is no heat or cover on the two back rear facing seats

Given the nature of the usage, I understand the need for a low deck height.  If all features are met, except that it has the foot pedal start, would that be considered?  Or is there no room to wiggle on that specification?

ANSWER/CLARIFICATION
As indicated in the Statement of Work, no pedal start will be approved.
QUESTION
Can you please tell me if you re looking for an aluminum/hard enclosure for the club car or a sunbrella enclosure? Please see the attachments. The sunbrella enclosure is signification cheaper and still has fixed doors on the forward facing seats?

ANSWER/CLARIFICATION
Please Section B.4 of the RFQ

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Question #1: What is the estimated annual usage quantity and average weekly delivered quantity required? <br />Answer #1: The weekly range varies but typically is between 100-150 lbs. a week
<p>Question #2: Standard dry ice pellet containers hold an estimated 500 pounds of dry ice, please confirm if this is similar to the current container used, or if not, what size is required. <br />Answer #2: We currently store our ice in our deep freezer and do not have an external container capable of holding pellets. This would have to be provided by the company.</p>
<p><br />Question #3: In reference to 2.1.1, are the dry ice pellets packed in poly bags inside the storage container, or will bulk dry ice pellets be acceptable? <br />Answer #3: - Currently, the blocks are packaged in plastic bags and stored in our deep freezer. <br />- Bulk dry ice pellets are acceptable if the company can provide a storage container.</p>
<p>Question #4: It appears there will not be a dock available for deliveries. As swapping of storage containers is necessary please confirm that transportation of the dry ice will not require the dry ice container to be pushed more than 50 feet or up an incline over uneven surfaces. <br />Answer #4: - The MDG has 2 loading docks that are accessible for deliveries. 1 is located in logistics warehouse and 1 is in the back area leading to ambulance services.<br />- The container will need to be on wheels to allow for easy delivery to the lab since loading docks are located &lt;50 feet away.</p>
<p><br />Question #5: Please confirm that if delivery is not on ground level that an elevator is available inside the building.<br />Answer #5: Delivery is in ground level</p>
<p>Question #6: Are there any security or gate check points that are required to deliver? If so, please confirm that estimated wait time will not exceed 15-20 minutes in order to access the delivery site.<br />Answer #6: Deliveries have to go through the Wheatland Gate checkpoint. Wait time varies depending on time of day, however if all required documents are present during the inspection (vehicle registration, deliver order forms, proof of insurance, valid driver's license) this will expedite the process.</p>

<DESC><p>Special Notice: Distributed Wind - Competitiveness Improvement Project<br />October 12, 2017</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) intends to release requests for proposals (RFPs) under the Competitiveness Improvement Project (CIP) early in 2018. The CIP Round 6 RFP topics may include Component Improvements and System Optimization, Manufacturing Process Improvements, Prototype Testing, Certification Testing, and Type Certification.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Wind Energy Technologies Office is committed to a multifaceted distributed wind energy research portfolio to facilitate U.S. wind industry leadership in the development of competitive, high-performance technology for domestic and global markets. Program objectives include increasing the number of small and midsize wind turbine designs tested to national performance and safety standards and reducing distributed wind system levelized cost of energy to be competitive with other distributed generation technologies (e.g. solar photovoltaics). Since 2012, and through 5 rounds of CIP, NREL has executed subcontracts that are intended to target these program objectives and increase the competitiveness of U.S. wind turbine technologies in the expanding global market for distributed energy systems. In July, 2017, North American Clean Energy published an article (http://www.nacleanenergy.com/articles/27632/doe-s-competitiveness-improvement-projects-are-delivering-substantial-cost-reductions-in-the-u-s-distributed-wind-industry) featuring the many successes achieved by previous CIP awardees.</p>
<p>Building on prior successes, in 2017 five separate RFPs were released under "Distributed Wind Turbine Competitiveness Improvement Project - Round 5". These RFPs included the topic areas referenced below:<br />Component Improvement and Overall System Optimization - Round 5<br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOE/NREL/NR/RGZ-7-70164/listing.html</p>
<p>Manufacturing Process Upgrades - Round 5<br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOE/NREL/NR/RGZ-7-70165/listing.html</p>
<p>Prototype Testing - Round 5 <br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOE/NREL/NR/RGZ-7-70167/listing.html</p>
<p>Certification Testing (&lt;200m2 RSA) - Round 5<br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOE/NREL/NR/RGZ-7-70166/listing.html</p>
<p>Type Certification &gt;200m2 and 1000m2 RSA) - Round 5<br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOE/NREL/NR/RGZ-7-70204/listing.html</p>
<p>No assumption should be made regarding the specific topic areas for any future competitive solicitations based on the past solicitations provided. The RFPs planned for 2018 will again include cost share requirements. Offerors should anticipate needing to demonstrate active engagement in the U.S. market, have links to the U.S. supply chain, demonstrate strong team skills and capabilities, and provide detailed financial information.</p>
<p>In advance of the release of the 2018 RFPs, NREL will host an informational CIP workshop at the National Wind Technology Center outside of Boulder, Colorado. This workshop will be held Wednesday, December 6 and will cover a number of topics including a review of the common topics of previous CIP solicitations, merit criteria for proposal reviews, design evaluation requirements, and testing and certification standards. Additional topics may be added. The workshop also affords an opportunity to meet with other members of the distributed wind community. Attendees will also be encouraged to provide feedback on the CIP and the focus of potential future solicitations. The workshop will provide the option to participate in person or via webinar. Registration is required for attendance and is available at: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/competitiveness-improvement-project-workshop-tickets-38086287110.</p>
<p>To be placed on a list to receive the RFPs when they are released, please contact Procurement Office Subcontract Administrator Kyndall Jackson at Kyndall.Jackson@nrel.gov.</p>

<CONTACT>Jamie E. MacGillis, Email jamie.e.macgillis.civ@mail.mil - Matthew R. Marx, Contracting Officer, Email matthew.r.marx.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>This is a request for information. There is no solicitation available at this time. ACC-APG is seeking to identify potential sources who have the capability and experience to provide the help desk support for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical-Terminal (SMART-T).
<p><br />SMART-T Overview:</p>
<p>The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical-Terminal (SMART-T), AN/TSC-154A, is the Army's only anti-jam, low probability of intercept, low probability of detection and nuclear electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) survivable worldwide satellite communication capability. It provides range extension to the Army's current and future tactical communications networks. The SMART-T processes data and voice communications at low, medium, and extended data rates. The AEHF SMART-T operates with MILSTAR/AEHF satellite constellation-compatible communications payloads. The terminal is transportable, palletized, and integrated into a High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). 391 SMART-Ts are fielded to the Army, USAF, USMC, Special Users, Canada and the Netherlands.</p>
<p><br />Key Help Desk Team Member Skills:</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to provide timely solutions for problems and calls for help from SMART-T users and maintainers<br />&bull; Ability to communicate with SMART-T users and maintainers to capture, document, and convey details of reported problems and needs for help to formulate a solution and in turn guide the user/maintainer through the resolution<br />&bull; Capable of applying troubleshooting techniques to formulate solutions to problems not resolvable by users or maintainers in the field, including the ability to interpret system drawings and interface documents to identify problems not isolated by SMART-T Built In Test (BIT) or system alert messages<br />&bull; Self-motivated to execute tasks in between help desk calls<br />&bull; Experience with operations and maintenance of SMART-T or other SATCOM terminals<br />&bull; Understanding of the physical security and handling of cryptographic and COMSEC material<br />&bull; Understanding of cryptographic key management, COMSEC encryption devices, and router based communications</p>
<p><br />SMART-T Maintenance Strategy:</p>
<p>&bull; The Army maintenance concept is consistent with AR 750-1, Army Materiel Maintenance Policy. A two-level maintenance structure is the framework for AEHF SMART-T hardware maintenance. <br />&bull; Operator maintenance is performed by the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 25Q, "Multichannel Transmission Systems Operator-Maintainer" in accordance with (IAW) TM 11-5895-1881-10 and includes the following tasks: <br />&nbsp; o&nbsp;Scheduled maintenance checks and services.<br />&nbsp; o Fault isolation to defective Circuit Card Assembly (CCA) or Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) through the use of Built-in Test (BIT).<br />&nbsp; o Repair of the system occurs by the replacement of defective CCAs, LRUs, and faulty cables that are easy to remove and replace using common tools.<br />&nbsp; o The SMART-T operator maintains the SMART-T unique generator by performing Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS).<br />&bull; Field maintenance is performed by MOS 25Q IAW TM 11-5895-1881-23 and 23P and includes the following tasks: <br />o Use common Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) with approved Army Technical Manuals (TMs) and troubleshooting procedures, perform isolation of faulty component assemblies, wiring harness, chassis, and subassemblies not readily identified by BIT.<br />&nbsp; o Use BIT to isolate faults and then repair through replacement where replacement tasks exceed the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) constraints at the organizational level.<br />&nbsp; o Repair by replacement of major assemblies and sub-assemblies, including installation and replacement of CCAs and LRUs.<br />&nbsp; o The MOS 52D, "Power Generator Equipment Repairer" will perform field maintenance of the SMART-T unique generator IAW TM 11-6115-747-13 and 23P. <br />&bull; Depot Level Maintenance is being established at the Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) for designated LRUs and the Key Load Initialization Facility (KLIF).<br />&bull; The Heavy HMMWV is a standard Army inventory vehicle with an established maintenance concept and structure that is already in place.</p>
<p><br />SMART-T Software Support: Raytheon performs software support to include corrective maintenance (i.e., defect correction) under the terms of the SMART-T system warranty coverage. Raytheon also performs software product improvements and other changes (e.g., requested enhancements and adaptations) through the engineering change process implemented by Product Manager (PdM) SATCOM. Raytheon will continue to provide software Configuration Management (CM) and sustainment. The Communications-Electronics Command's (CECOM's) Software Engineering Center will perform software sustainment management for the system under Post Production Software Support.<br />Hardware Supply Support: The AEHF SMART-T supply support concept for spare and repair parts is as follows:<br />&bull; The CECOM National Inventory Control Point is the Primary Inventory Control Activity and is responsible for all cataloging activity using the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS).<br />&bull; Supply support will occur through military channels IAW the Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures system.<br />&bull; The CECOM Integrated Logistics Support Center manages unique SMART-T items, while the Defense Logistics Agency manages common consumables.<br />&bull; The SMART-T Provisioning Bills of Material contain the spares, repair parts, and attaching hardware necessary to accomplish all maintenance as defined in the Maintenance Allocation Chart for the SMART-T system and generator.</p>

<DESC>Request for Proposals #P17PS01771 is an adaptive renovation project to turn a historic building into offices, in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties for Rehabilitation.  The Work includes a new seismic lateral system, mechanical, plumbing, fire suppression, information technologies, lighting, and electrical system upgrades, two new accessible conference rooms, restrooms, and a break room, interior office improvements and reorganization, new interior finishes, new roofing, new accessible exterior and interior doors, exterior siding repairs, paint preparation, painting, new railings, accessible path from parking area, and enhanced site drainage.

A bid (offer) guarantee (20%), payment bond (100%), performance bond (100%), and liability insurance will be required prior to contract performance.
PROJECT LOCATION:    The building is located in Vancouver, WA 98661.  Maps and information are at www.nps.gov/FOVA.       
SITE VISIT: A group site visit will be held on October 11, 2017; details in Section L of the solicitation.  Attendance at the site visit is strongly encouraged (not mandatory).  Requests for individual site visits will not be honored.
DETAILS:  This is a best value negotiated procurement set-aside for small business concerns in accordance with FAR Part 19.5. The NAICS code for this project is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the small business size standard is $36.5 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  All work will be performed under a single firm-fixed-price construction contract subject to the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction), formerly known as the Davis-Bacon Act.  The contractor will have 300 calendar days to complete the project after the Notice to Proceed is issued.  The estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $1,000,000 and $2,500,000.  
The RFP and future amendments will be posted at www.FBO.gov on approximately September 20, 2017.  Responses will be due approximately 30 days thereafter, unless extended.  The entire solicitation package, including drawings and specifications, will be in Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF. Offerors will submit their proposals in digital format per instructions included in the solicitation.  The RFP will require offerors to submit both a technical and a price proposal; the government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price and award to the firm whose offer represents the best value.
Vendors can search for opportunities and award history on www.fbo.gov without registering.  Prospective offerors will be required to visit www.FBO.gov periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents; no other notifications will be sent.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued.  The Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website has an Interested Vendors List where you can add your company's interest.  Registering provides the opportunity to receive notifications; this is a tool of convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  All eligible responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the National Park Service, however offerors who have not established and/or maintained an active registration at www.SAM.gov prior to the offer due date and time will be considered either ineligible or non-responsive and will not be considered for award. 
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. 
The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

<DESC>This is an INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT by Fleet Readiness Center Western Pacific (FRCWP) for Aviation Depot-Level Maintenance, Modification, Repair and Overhaul (MMRO) services in support of United States Marine Corps AH-1Z and UH-1Y aircraft.  This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  The planned industry day will serve as a market research tool, both for informing industry of United States Government (USG) requirements for AH-1Z and UH-1Y MMRO services and for determining industry’s interest, awareness and capabilities for providing those services.  The industry day forum will allow for networking among interested service providers and lead to USG awareness of industry’s capabilities for supporting the AH-1Z and UH-1Y.
  FRCWP will host the Industry Day on 16-17 November 2017 at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma, Okinawa, Japan, beginning at 9:00 AM and ending at 4:00 PM each day.
FRCWP uses USG contracts with MMRO service providers to support aircraft maintenance.  In general, requirements will consist of Integrated Maintenance Plan (IMP) and In-Service Repair (ISR) Depot-Level support.  FRCWP is particularly interested in identifying potential service providers for its upcoming AH-1Z and UH-1Y IMP and ISR support requirement.  Aviation MMRO service providers will have the opportunity to learn about FRCWP’s mission, to meet with contracting personnel from Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and to tour the relevant facilities on MCAS Futenma, Japan.
    If questions arise during the industry day that cannot be answered in person, those answers will be published on ASIA NECO and FEDBIZOPPS after the event.  There will be limited availability for Industry/Government one-on-one sessions on 18 November for interested service providers.  Depending on the number of companies attending, the one-on-one sessions are anticipated to be held in 60-minute intervals on the hour by appointment only.  Questions from the one-on-one sessions will NOT be published..

Advance registration for this event is required.  Parties interested in attending the industry day and the one-on-one sessions must submit a reservation request via email to Mr. Kurt Dronenburg at kurt.dronenburg@fe.navy.mil and to Mr.
 Seiji Yoshino at seiji_yoshino.ja@fe.navy.mil.  Requests shall include the company’s name, the names and titles of participating individuals, and contact information to include telephone numbers and email addresses.  Participating companies are further requested to provide CAGE and NAICS codes if available.  No more than five participants per company may register.  Additional instructions for accessing the industry day location will be provided at the time reservations are received.  

All registrations must be received no later than 17:00 PM Tokyo time on 20 October 2017.  Registration submittals must include MCAS Futenma Base Access requests per the attached four (2) files.  Participants wishing to attend the conference who do not possess the proper documents for access to MCAS Futenma must advise the USG during the reservation process.
  Vendors are responsible for securing their own lodging and food during this event.  Industry participation is voluntary and the USG will not reimburse respondents or attendees for efforts expended as a result of this notice.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is seeking a commercialization partner for a true random number generation device and specifically a device for the generation of true random numbers using quantum mechanical systems. This promising technology was selected as a participant in the ORNL Technology Innovation Program (TIP). TIP is a royalty-funded technology maturation program designed to accelerate the commercial adoption of high potential ORNL technologies. And the ORNL Science and Technology Partnerships Office is now accepting licensing applications through November 1, 2017.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prospective licensees are invited to attend the </span><a href="https://www.ornl.gov/partnerships/technology-innovation-program"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">ORNL TIP Showcase</span></a><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> On October 3, 2017, which will feature technical presentations and laboratory tours.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">True uniform random numbers are incredibly difficult to acquire. Pseudo-random number generators are not truly random because they require a seed from some source, typically the system time. A seed and deterministic algorithm makes the numbers predictable which makes the security vulnerable. Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) are different because they rely on the truly random nature of quantum mechanics to guarantee the unpredictability. However, while the quantum mechanics guarantee theoretical randomness, there are ambient effects that can affect the results. Additionally, QRNGs are notoriously slow in generation of numbers.</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have developed a self-correcting quantum random number generator. The novelty of the present invention lies in the use of quantum statistical tests of randomness. The ORNL device is also several orders of magnitude cheaper than contemporary devices. In addition, the device is capable of recognizing and accounting for its own bias, making the produced numbers true random numbers.</span></p>

These membership seats provide:<br />&bull; Access to four (4) regional TTI Vanguard events (TTI/Vanguard events are highly interactive sessions that foster brainstorming and networking among attendees); <br />&bull; Several Executive workshops throughout the year (one-day seminars conducted for TTI/Vanguard members that focus on the role and influence of new technologies on current and future management and business issues);<br />&bull; TTI/Vanguard field trips present opportunities for members to visit the world's leading research institutes and development laboratories to preview new technologies<br />&bull; All TTI Vanguard written deliverables and publications; and<br />&bull; Access to the Member Archives of TTI Vanguard's website for up to 15 individuals.</p>
<p><br />This requirement is utilizing procedures in FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items in conjunction with<br />procedures in FAR Part 13.

<DESC>Mod 01: Mod 01 is issued to extend the period of performance on the BPA from October 23, 2017 through February 20, 2018. This extension is required for security purposes. The BPA includes a Contract Line Item (CLIN) for installation with a period of performance/delivery date of 120 days after receipt of order (ARO). As an order for installation services can be executed through the end of the BPA (October 23, 2017),installation can occur for 120 days ARO (through February 20, 2018). A DD254 was executed at the BPA level for the period of performance of October 24, 2014 through October 23, 2017. Due to the possibility of installation occurring through February 20, 2018, the period of performance of the BPA must be extended through February 20, 2018 in order to ensure the contractor's Common Access Card remains in effect. As a result of this modification, there will be no change to the current BPA ceiling. The ordering period remains October 24, 2014 through October 23, 2017. No additional orders will be executed following October 23, 2017.
