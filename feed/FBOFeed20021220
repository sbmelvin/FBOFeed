<DESC>NASA, Langley Research Center plans to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for the X43C Hypersonic Demonstrator Vehicle on or about January 23, 2003.  The X43C Project is a follow-on activity to the NASA Hyper-X (X43A) Program.  The X43C Project will use hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet technology developed by the Air Force HyTech Program to explore the Mach 5 to Mach 7 flight regime.  This procurement covers the final design, development, fabrication, assembly, integration, verification testing and associated flight test support for three hypersonic demonstrator vehicles (DV) and adaptors, a ground-test flight clearance engine and ground support equipment.  The three X43C DV's are to demonstrate the dual-mode scramjet propulsion system in free flight across a range of flight conditions.  The demonstration involves boosting the X43C DV to the start of test conditions using a rocket powered booster.  The adapter called out above is for mounting the DV onto the booster.  The booster and launch services will be the subject of a future procurement.  A cost-plus-incentive fee contract is contemplated for the DV and adapter procurement, with a period of performance of sixty-six (66) months.  The projected contract start date is August 2003. The DRFP will be issued pursuant to NASA FAR Supplement 1815.201.  Questions/comments are invited from potential offerors on all aspects of the DRFP, including the requirements, schedules, proposal instructions, incentive fee plan and evaluation approach.  The Government is not requesting proposals in response to this DRFP, does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation and does not intend to pay for any information received regarding this solicitation.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit questions/comments to the Contracting Officer, Brad Gardner by e-mail to r.b.gardner@larc.nasa.gov. An X43C Industry Briefing is planned for February 3, 2003 at the ODU Peninsula Graduate Center from 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  The briefing is intended to convey a detailed status of the project and DV requirements, conceptual design of the X43C DV, ongoing and concluded trade studies, aerodynamic and propulsion testing and related information.  Attendance at the briefing will be limited to four (4) representatives per company.  The briefing will be unclassified though it will involve the presentation of information which falls under the purview of the U.S. Munitions List (USML) as defined in the International Traffic In Arms (ITAR), 22 CFR 120-130.

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). This procurement is being conducted on a name brand or equal, basis.  Proposed items must meet or exceed the specification contained in the item description. Item 1.  Part number: SR830 (Stanford Research Systems) or  equal - DSP Dual Phase Lock-In Amplifiers	    2 EACH Specification for Lock In Amplifiers: · Fully differential input (selectable). · Maximum of 6 nV/ÖHz of input noise at 1 kHz with an input impedance of 10 MW. · The minimum full scale input voltage is 2 nV · A current input amplifier with a switchable gain of 106 or 108 Volts/Amp. · Line (50 Hz or 60 Hz) with 2x line filters to reduce line related interference · Digital architecture to eliminate the need for input band-pass filters. · Minimum 100 dB of dynamic reserve without input bandpass filters. · DSP processor capable of performing at least 16 million 24-bit multiplications and additions every second.  · The input to be digitized at 256 kHz by a precision 18-bit A/D converter. · Dynamic reserve, a key figure of merit for lock-in amplifiers, is a specification often mentioned by lock-in manufacturers without offering a precise definition. Where dynamic reserve is defined as follows: The dynamic reserve of a lock-in amplifier at a given full-scale input voltage is the ratio (in dB) of the Largest Interfering Signal to the full-scale input voltage. The Largest Interfering Signal is defined as the amplitude of the largest signal at any frequency that can be applied to the input before the lock-in cannot measure a signal with its specified accuracy. · Time constants from 10 ms to 30,000 secs to be selected, with a choice of 6, 12, 18 and even 24 dB/oct filter roll off. · For low frequency measurements (below 200 Hz), synchronous filters can be engaged to notch out multiples of the reference frequency. · Phase shift capability: to be measured with 0.01° resolution and the X and Y outputs to be orthogonal to 0.001°. · Direct digital synthesis (DDS) source with a maximum of –80 dBc (capable of very low distortion) reference signal.	· Single frequency sine waves that can be generated from 1 mHz to 102 kHz with 4 1/2 digits of frequency resolution. · Both frequency and amplitude can be set from the front panel or from a computer. · Capable of using an external reference, where the synthesized source is phase locked to the reference signal. · Two data displays configurable to show X, Y, R, q, Xnoise, Ynoise or either of the two aux inputs. · Up to nine different instrument configurations storable in non-volatile RAM. · Standard RS-232 and GPIB interfaces to provide communication with computers. All system functions monitored through the interfaces. · Auto-functions to allow autonomous adjustment of parameters.  · Single key press to allow gain, phase, offset and dynamic reserve to be optimized. · Allow any harmonic (2F, 3F, ... nF) up to 102 kHz to be measured without changing the reference frequency. · User-defined output for measuring X, R, X-noise, Aux1, Aux 2 or the ratio of the input signal to an external voltage. A second user-defined output that measures Y, q, Y-noise, Aux 3, Aux 4 or ratio.  · X and Y analog outputs (rear panel) that are updated at 256 kHz.  · Two 16,000 point buffers to simultaneously record two measurements. Data can be transferred from the buffers using the computer interfaces. A trigger input is to be provided to externally synchronize data recording. Item 2.

<DESC>REFERENCE NUMBER 71257. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. Gov.Works on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces its intention to award a sole source contract to Energetics, Incorporated for approximately $900,000. The contractor will provide assistance to DOE's office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) for strategic planning, technical, economic and environmental analysis. Strategic Planning and Budget Development - Energetics, Inc. has played an instrumental role in the development of EERE planning documents since 1979.  Energetics developed the first multi-year plan produced by EERE in the 1980s, which included chapters on essentially three offices - Transportation, Buildings, and Industry.  They have historically been at the forefront of strategic planning activities in EERE, and have extensive, unparralled corporate knowledge of the EERE structure and the evolution of its mission and offices.  They have considerable experience in war room development for EERE dating back to the 1980s, which has provided them with a unique historical understanding of the successes and failures of these activities.  We have intimate knowledge of the budget process, and have assisted various sector offices with budget development and justification for over 20 years.  Their staff is highly experienced in analyzing emerging trends and issues that will impact EERE, and translating these into budget language that provides a strong justification for programs based on credible data. Technical, Economic, and Environmental Analysis -  Their staff includes engineers that are very knowledgeable in the field of conventional biomass processing, biochemical engineering, and the production of bioproducts.   In addition, their engineers have over 30 years of combined experience in the areas of chemical processing, petroleum refining, and pulp and paper, three major industries that could be substantially impacted by the emerging bioindustry.  This combination of knowledge of bioprocessing and conventional chemicals and petroleum production gives Energetics a unique perspective and understanding of the issues surrounding the bioindustry as well as conventional manufacturing industries.  Their staff understands the inter-relationships between these basic industries, their feedstocks and products, and the new bioindustry.  Energetics' staff has conducted numerous technical, economic and environmental studies of technologies and trends impacting industry and the U.S. , including studies on areas of emerging importance (global warming, oil volatility).  They bring a unique understanding of these issues to evaluate the potential impacts for the bioindustry.  Energetics assisted with the development of the National Energy Strategy during the previous Bush administration, as well as other policy initiatives, and have a big-picture outlook that will be invaluable to OBP in their decision-making processes. Meeting Planning, Organization and Facilitation - Energetics has over 15 years of meeting planning, organization, and facilitation experience.  Staff includes a dozen or more highly trained, professional facilitators who have collectively organized and facilitated over 150 workshops with diverse participants from industry, universities, national laboratories, government agencies, and private research institutions.  These meetings range from very large conferences (OIT EXPO) to technology roadmap meetings to internal planning meetings.  A large portion of these have been conducted for EERE or other DOE offices.  They organized and facilitated numerous meetings for the bioenergy and bioproducts groups, including nearly all related roadmap workshops.  Their staff also includes experienced meeting planners who are highly knowledgeable in meeting logistics, including site selection and acquisition, coordinating the invitation process, speaker selection, preparation of meeting materials, and related activities.  They also have substantial experience in agenda development, overall meeting planning, and meeting report development and preparation. Portfolio Management - Energetics has successfully organized and conducted dozens of program and project review meetings for various offices within EERE over the past 20 years.  They have significant experience in conducting portfolio review and analysis for EERE, as well as multiple-office portfolio integration for the Office of Policy, Planning and Analysis.  They bring a unique perspective that enables us to see how individual offices fit within the DOE-wide mission.  Energetics' staff is very knowledgeable with the tools currently used for portfolio analysis, and we have developed a multi-use, comprehensive database for all bioenergy R&D at federal agencies.   When this knowledge is combined with their thorough knowledge of DOE and EERE programs, it makes us uniquely qualified to assist OBP in reviewing its portfolio and progress against goals. The period of performance would be from award through December 31, 2005. Firms that believe they can provide the required items and services described above should identify themselves in writing to the Contracting Officer. Such firms must submit supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the stated requirements. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Tank-automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) announces the availability of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) number DAAE07-03-Q-BAA1 dated 20 December 2002. TARDEC is seeking innovative technologies, efforts, and projec ts in a variety of topic areas that (a) offer a capability that is a superior, innovative, or a unique solution to a military need, problem or challenge; and (b) will benefit agency programs, and/or contribute to the accomplishment of the Army's mission, a nd/or have a commercial application or other public benefit. Topic areas are listed alphabetically and are not in any order of importance. Technical approaches that provide an integrated solution in multiple topic areas may be submitted, but you must ident ify a single lead topic for your white paper and/or proposal submission.       A BAA is a form of solicitation authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulation when the government wants to fund certain forms of research and development. The BAA is issued to solicit competitive proposals against a range of topics, and is expected to l ead to award of one or more contracts or agreements for the conduct of basic or applied research or that part of development not related to development of a specific system or hardware as defined in FAR 2.1 and FAR 35.001. The topics covered by this BAA ar e listed in Part V of the announcement.  Unlike the structure of many government competitions, the evaluation of proposed projects per this BAA will be conducted in two phases, as follows: (1) In the FIRST PHASE, companies interested in participating in the BAA submit a document called a 'white paper.' A white paper is a three to five page brief abstract or summary of the proposed project. It gives a synopsis of the project but does not incl ude the full technical and cost detail, or the back-up information, that would be a part of a complete proposal. All white papers received will be subjected to peer and scientific review. The submission of white papers is a step designed to preclude compan ies from incurring the effort and expense of preparing full technical and cost proposals, for projects having little chance of being funded. (2) In the SECOND PHASE, companies whose white papers show the most promise are issued a written invitation by the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) to submit a complete technical and cost proposal for the planned project. During this second phase, a Gov ernment evaluation team will review all proposals, and evaluate and rate each against the evaluation criteria set forth in the announcement and rank and rate each proposal within each topic. Proposals will be selected for award, consistent with the availab ility of Government funding, based on a source selection assessment as described in Part VIII below. Negotiations may be conducted to enhance the Government?s evaluation process. Program funding is currently not available for this effort. Due to Government budget uncertainties, funding for awards is currently pending and the amount available for award is estimated to be the amounts shown against each of the topics. The number of pr ojects and the final dollar value of each project will depend on the total funds available. The BAA provides further information on the above areas of interest, white paper format, proposal format, submission instructions, evaluation process and criteria a nd other information. White papers must be received not later than 1500 hours local time (3:00PM EST) on January 28, 2003. The BAA may be electronically downloaded from TACOM's website at http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/baapage.htm  If you have any questions, please get in touch with Ms. Harriet Marcet, marceth@tacom.army.mil, or (586) 574-5573.

<DESC>The U.S. Army at TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal is issuing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Joint Service Small Arms Program Office (JSSAP), in support of the Objective Force Warrior (OFW) program. This BAA is issued under the provisions of FAR 6.102(d)(2). The purpose of this BAA is to solicit proposals for component technologies that will support the development of a Lightweight Family of Weapons and Ammunition (LFWA). The LFWA will provide the Lethality component of the Objective Force Warrior (OFW) program. The initial focus of the LFWA program will be on developing lightweight machine guns and ammunition. The objective is a "clean sheet of paper" approach that will yield technologies (weapon and ammunition) that are reproducible in mass, robust, easy to operate and maintain, and reliable under all conditions, while taking up less volume and weighing 30-35% less than current systems. Proposals submitted under this BAA shall be limited in scope to a 12-month effort. Submitters are urged to focus their efforts on individual component technologies that will help dramatically reduce the size and/or weight of individual and crew-served weapon systems while maintaining current performance. Improvements may evolve from technologies developed for other weapon systems or from applications not used previously in the weapon and ammunition arena. Also, technologies may reveal applications of old ideas which technological barriers heretofore prevented. This BAA can be downloaded from the following website: http://procnet.pica.army.mil. All responses to this notice shall be done so in the English language. Responses should be sent to Stephanie MeGee, Contract Specialist at smegee@pica.army.mil.

<DESC>Release of Information for Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) Maintenance, Additional Capabilities and Components Software (MACCS). Purpose:  Intended to provide high-level requirements to companies who are interested in developing Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) common capabilities.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Description:  The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) Program Office envisions development of a series of Common Capabilities software modules that will be integrated with the JMPS architecture.  The program office anticipates procuring some, all or none of the common capabilities listed below to support automated mission planning for aircraft and weapons in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Special Operations Forces. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a request for proposal or award a contract as a result of this request.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a RFP, nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government cannot predetermine at the project level the precise JMPS common capabilities and associated quantities/deliverables to be acquired at this time.  The program includes development, testing and integration of some or all of the automated mission planning areas listed to the right. A related effort is the JMPS System Engineering and Integration Contractor (SEIC) effort.  The RFI and additional information can be found on the HERRB website. These Common Capabilities are further defined in the Common Capability Requirements Documents (CCRD).  The CCRD's can be found on the HERBB web site. Industry Day Conference Invitation/Announcement --  The Government is in the early stage of planning for the MACCS acquisition strategy and would welcome industry's input. It is the Government's intention under market research to hold an unclassified industry day to be held on 09 Jan 2003, from 0800 - 1700, at the Base Theater, Building 1763, Eglin AFB, FL. All visitors should enter Eglin AFB via the West Gate.

Attendance will be limited to 5 people from each company. Note: this announcement is part of market research only; it is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotations (RFQ), or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does it commit the Government to issue such a request or invitation. Industry day participation is strictly voluntary and the Government will not provide any reimbursement or otherwise pay for information/presentations associated with Industry Day. See Note 26.

<DESC>USAID will post a request for proposals (RFP) for indefinite quantity contracts (IQCs) with time and materials (T&M) pricing for technical assistance in the area of Commercial Legal and Institutional Reform. USAID estimates awarding up to five contracts, consisting of up to four unrestricted contracts and one set-aside contract for small business (on the condition that it is capable of undertaking the work). USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering limitation of the contracts resulting from this RFP will be $600,000,000 over the five-year ordering period. Note also that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate. Note that there is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded or the number of orders that any one firm will receive beyond the minimum stated in the RFP. The RFP will be posted only at www.fbo.gov. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. Proposals are expected to be due on March 4, 2003. The purpose of these IQCs are to empower missions to engage in commercial legal and institutional reform (CLIR) projects by enabling them to procure short- and long-term services through a structured and easy-to-use procurement system.  In the process, the CLIR IQCs seek to build upon the work completed under the original Support for Economic Growth and Institutional Reform (SEGIR) Legal and Institutional Reform (LIR) IQCs, accumulating the intellectual and technical resources necessary to better understand, and thereby overcome, legal and institutional constraints to economic growth experienced by developing countries. USAID hopes to make the task of CLIR more efficient by achieving economies of scale in response to the technical assistance demands of developing countries (as communicated through USAID missions worldwide).  Finally, USAID seeks to advance state-of-the-art practice within the international donor community by making contributions to development theory. Activities under this Subject Area will fall within the following functional areas: (a) General Commercial Legal Framework; (b) Business Environment; (c) Financial Services; (d) Trade and Investment; (e) Commercial Dispute Resolution; (f) Institutional Reform; and (g) Property Rights. NAIC Code 541611. Numbered Note 2 is applicable.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SPAWARSYSCEN-SD) intends to award a sole source contract to Darlington, Inc., of Arlington, Virginia, under the authority of FAR 6.302 for Over the Horizon Targeting (OTH-T) development utilizing  Common Operational Picture Synchronization Tool (CST), Integrated Shipboard Network System (ISNS), Web Centric Anti Submarine Warfare Network (WeCAN) and Coalition Wide Area Network (COWAN). Darlington, Inc., developed both the CST, utilized since the early Joint Warfare Interoperability Demonstration exercises in 1994, and the COWAN software that is used to integrate coalition partners into a common network to create a virtual private network. The OTH-T program is tasked under OPNAV 9410.5 to provide trusted agent interoperability certification and developmental testing of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems and architectures.  The contractor will improve and apply the CST, ISNS, WeCAN, and COWAN in the development of OTH-T products to include Fleet Systems Engineering Team (FSET) support, RLBTS enhancements, Collaboration at Sea (CAS) test bed development, and C4I problem solution engineering. Expertise and requisite skills in CST, ISNS, COWAN and WeCAN in support of OTH-T including FSET support, RLBTS laboratory enhancements, CAS test bed development and C4I problem solution engineering is required. This will be a cost-plus fixed-fee contract with a base effort of one-year and four one-year options. The government has determined that this procurement is not available for competition because an attempt to replicate current source capabilities would result in substantial duplication of cost not recoverable through full and open competition and an unacceptable delay would occur. The North American Industry Classification System code for this effort is 541330 and the small business size standard is $23M. See Note 22.

Because the data base was developed under grant to and is maintained by the proposed contractor, the Government does      not anticipate negotiations with any other source.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), contemplates sole-source negotiations with Indiana University for the continued maintenance and expansion of the ?National Research Roster for Huntington Disease.?  A new five-year contract, beginning July, 2003 is contemplated.  The Indiana University has, since 1979, developed, maintained and expanded the National Roster for Huntington Disease Patients and Families for the NINDS.  This roster has had a substantial impact in stimulating and supporting research on Huntington?s Disease.  The roster is used to contact potential participants in research studies, to locate individuals of particular research interest, and to provide statistical and demographic data on Huntington?s Disease.  The present contractor has approximately 20 years experience collecting information from Huntington?s Disease patients, and has established an extensive and intimate relationship with the participating patients and their family members.  The contractor also has extensive experience with the participants associated with the data collection, coding, storage and retrieval methods.  The contractor has the capability to establish genealogy, access patients, and to maintain a roster which provides statistical and demographic data on Huntington?s Disease.  The NINDS considers Indiana University the only source to continue this work by virtue of their intimate involvement with the patients and families participating in the roster, the sensitive nature of the records, their prerequisite knowledge, skilled personnel, experience, and facilities as demonstrated by their past and current work under this contract project.  Indiana University is considered the only responsible source to continue this work pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Patient and family confidentiality issues preclude the transfer of roster information to another source without the written consent and permission of the current roster participants.  The duplication of cost and effort, and time delays that would be encountered for another organization to re-establish this roster at its current operational level, are unacceptable to the Government.  This is not a formal solicitation nor an announcement that a RFP is available.  See numbered notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Duke University Medical Center of North Carolina in Durham, NC 27705, to participate in the National Children's Study (NCS) in support of the Human Studies Facility in Chapel Hill, NC.    EPA is interested in the investigation of certain key developmental disorders that have been associated, at least in theory, with environmental exposures.  One of these is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  EPA is interested in obtaining and evaluating information  already collected.  Specific collection of information to EPA exists in the clinical case files of the Duke University Child and Family Study Center.  These are the reasons that EPA believes that the Duke University Medical Center is the only source capable of providing the specific services and  the only source with access to and familiarity with the structure and content of the ADHD case records.  Several hundred children have been evaluated for ADHD in the clinic and their records shall be made available to EPA for research purposes.  Objective: The purpose of this project is to obtain  access to the existing paper records and to have them translated into an electronic format that can be used to help plan studies that will be part of the NCS.  It shall be necessary for the contractor to review the paper case files, extract specific information, transfer the information to a  database and statistically analyze the relationships among the various data values and the child's diagnosis.  Scope of Work:  Under this project, the Contractor  shall perform the following tasks:  TASK 1- Review charts of approximately 400 cases from the Duke Child and Family Center ADHD clinic.   Extract data on pregnancy, birth, development and medical history and ADHD type diagnosis.  TASK 2 - Develop a data base containing records concerning pregnancy, birth, development and medical history obtained through completion of Task 1.  Cross reference questionnaire data with diagnosis.  TASK 3  - Use appropriate statistical techniques to evaluate potential predictive relationships among questionnaire and diagnostic data.  TASK 4 - Develop supplemental screening questions to refine and extend the scope and predictive value of standard assessment.  Provide recommendations regarding  questions that may be eliminated without a loss of predictive ability.  A total of five reports shall be required.  Individual reports summarizing the results of completing each of Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4 are required.  The fifth report shall summarize the overall project and integrate the individual  tasks.  In addition, written database documentation, both technical level and user level, is required for Task 2. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990, which has a small business size standard of $5.0 million, is applicable.   All interested parties who believe they  can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities in writing within 15 days of the date of this announcement.  No Solicitation is available.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any additional source (s) exist and, therefore, no Request for Proposal (RFP) is  available.  Consequently, any response (s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will be ignored.  Submit response no later than 6 January 2003 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attn: Joy Kimble, RTP-POD  (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  This synopsis is being issued pursuant to the requirements of DFAR 208.404-70 to provide a ?fair notice of intent? to make a purchase of required Professional Engineering Services under the Federal Supply Schedule Group 871-3 (SIN), System Design, Engineering and Integration as the solicitation will be limited to qualified current GSA Schedule holders.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE.  Services will be procured in accordance with procedures listed in the Multiple Award Schedules Program Owner?s Manual for those schedules that require issuance of a Statement of Work (SOW)(Appendix A).  The 354th Contracting Squadron, Eielson AFB, Alaska is seeking qualified sources to research, design, develop, integrate and construct two new communications sites for the 353rd Combat Training Squadron.  Each site will support 16 Ground to Air Transmit and Receive (GATR) radios to augment existing systems to improve communications between Eielson Range Control and military and civilian aircraft flying in the 67,000 square miles of the Pacific Alaskan Range Complex (PARC).  Contractor must use existing PARC infrastructure as much as pragmatic to reduce design, hardware, and installation costs.  Integration of the radio audio, key, and control functions into the existing Litton-Denro 400D V 3 Integrated Communication Switching System (ICSSO will be an important part of this project.  Sites will be controlled by a System Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that will provide overall site control and monitoring of power generation, distribution, back-up power management, site alarms, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and weather data and cameras.  The sites are remote, at high elevations and undeveloped.  In order to be reliable, site design must overcome the challenges of the harsh Alaskan environment.  Reliable alternate energy sources such as wind and solar will be exhaustively research and designed in the system by the successful contractor.  Configuration management and documentation will be an important part of this project.  This will include design drawings, theory of operation, as-built drawings, manufacturer?s manuals and contractor-generated operation, interface, maintenance, and trouble shooting manuals.  Basis for award of the resultant delivery order will be best value to the Government, cost and non-cost factors considered.  If interested, please provide the following information:  Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Phone Number, Fax Number and E-mail address to Julia Stringer, Contract Specialist, at (907) 377-2223, fax number (907) 377-2547 or preferably via E-mail at julia.stringer@eielson.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CORRECT AN ERROR IN THE ORIGINAL POSTING. 
    THE ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT WAS LABELED A " PRESOLICITATION NOTICE " BY MISTAKE. IT WAS ACTUALLY INTENDED TO BE, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED, A " COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION ".  THE MARITIME ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS PER THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT. 


United States Government ?V Maritime Administration
Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF)
Vessel Defueling/Removal and Tank Cleaning Solutions

Description:
The U.S. Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), South Atlantic Region, maintains ships stowage facilities for merchant and Navy ships at the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF), located on the James River at Fort Eustis, VA. These ships have become obsolete due to age and contain various amounts of fuels, oil, lubricants, oily water and ballast water in their tanks.  Some of the fuel tanks have leaks due to steel deterioration. 

MARAD is seeking innovative technical/management approaches to the environmentally safe and economically feasible defueling and removal of all petroleum products, as well as tank cleaning operations of obsolete vessels. (A complete listing of the vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A. This list of ships is subject to change.)  In addition to conventional fuel removal and disposal and tank cleaning techniques, innovative solutions are invited that employ modern environmentally safe technology, including, but not limited to, safe chemical or bio-remediation techiques that dispose of residual fuel and other petroleum products.  Note that some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.

Offerors may respond to one or both parts (i.e., defueling and/or tank cleaning) for any or all of the obsolete vessels listed on Attachment A.  Upon award, offerors will be required to identify the types of petroleum products, total quantity of the product, chemical analysis of the product, and the proposed methods of removal for the petroleum products from the vessel and their subsequent transportation to a disposal or recycling facility.  MARAD anticipates that the costs of this project will be partially offset by the resale value of the fuel or petroleum product.

Opportunities for Fleet Site Visits
MARAD has established two periods, January 27-29, 2003 and May 19-21, 2003, for interested parties to visit the JRRF and view the ships listed in Attachment A.  MARAD requests those interested in visiting the JRRF contact the point of contact (POC) not later than Friday, January 10, 2003 to register for the January 27-29 fleet site visit and not later than Friday, May 2, 2003 to register for the May 19-21 fleet sit visit.  The POC will request information regarding the identity of the visitors and information regarding the company/organization the visitor represents, and assign a time for the visit. The JRRF POC is Mr. Mike Bagley (757) 887-3233 Ext. 0, e-mail sharon.nesbit@marad.dot.gov.

Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to this PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

?Y Innovative technical/management approaches for the environmentally safe and economically feasible defueling and/or tank cleaning of the vessels identified in Attachment A 
?Y Methodology for identifying the types, total quantity, chemical analysis, as well as the  removal and disposal of the petroleum products
?Y Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
?Y Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with fuel removal and/or tank cleaning on obsolete vessels
?Y Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

?Y Feasibility and likelihood of success of technical/management approach for the removal/disposal of petroleum products and/or tank cleaning of the vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
?Y Economic feasibility of the proposed approach(es) including schedule/cost assessments
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed methodology for identification and chemical analysis of petroleum products
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed removal/disposal of petroleum products and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the removal/disposal of fuel/petroleum products and/or tank cleaning of obsolete vessels
?Y Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed technical/management approach(es)

In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price. 

The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate the implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as to provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised and are considered confidential.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or all of the proposal(s) to implement the innovative solutions offered. The Government has the right to select or refuse any or all of the offers.

<DESC>.  This notice seeks information on potential sources.  In addition to the technical challenges of this planned contract, proprietary data is involved for which the Government has only limited rights.  Interested and capable sources must provide complete responses to Sue Krauss, contract specialist, by e-mail not later than 07 January 2003 at Charlene.krauss@tinker.af.mil or by Facsimile to (405) 739-5451.  Interested sources must provide the following as a minimum response:  Details of the Contractor?s experience in support of Aircraft Mission Communications, evidence of ability to hangar aircraft identified in the description of effort, ISO 9002 compliance, and evidence of ability to obtain proprietary data from L-3 Communications.
	The Mission Communications System (MCS) Support contract will cover the VC-25A, C-20B, C-9A and C-9C Special Air Mission (SAM) aircraft.  The contract will include upgrade, spares, repair, on-site test bench support and operation, and field representative support.  The contract will also encompass a System Integration Lab (SIL) used for testing prior to integration of new systems to the MCS.  The MCS is a suite of airborne electronic equipment and systems.  It is composed of voice, data, facsimile, and encryption/decryption equipment interconnected with radio communications systems by a Communications Switching System (CSS). The switch is software and hardware driven.  The proprietary data for the switch is owned by L-3 Communications (previously E-Systems Inc.).  The Government has only limited rights in the data for the switching systems and therefore will not be able to provide the data to contractors.  While the MCS for each of the aircraft within the SAM fleet complies with the same general MCS description, each platform has a different specific combination of equipment to suit the mission.  
	The support being acquired will include program management, recurring and nonrecurring engineering efforts, minor system prototypes, minor modifications, upgrades and enhancements, drop-in, and kit purchases. 
	Recurring tasks consist of review of service reports, daily requests for technical information, performing preliminary engineering investigations, Field Service Representatives, maintenance of the SIL, and the requirement to maintain drawings and technical data files.  Other recurring tasks consist of the requirement for a 24-hour standby service to respond to in-flight emergencies and emergency inquiries as well as on-site support and operation of the test benches that are located at Andrews AFB in support of the MCS systems. 
Nonrecurring tasks consist of requests for software/hardware corrections; engineering feasibility studies, analyses and investigations of Material Deficiency Reports (MDR) and mishaps; and requirements for technical orders, preliminary engineering change proposals, and hardware/software development and test. 
Minor modifications, upgrades and enhancements under this contract will include design, testing, integration, and kit purchases.  The installation of the kits will occur under the appropriate Contractor Logistics Support contract for each aircraft or depot field teams. 
The proposed drop-in line item on the contract will allow an aircraft to be delivered for repair and minor modification support!!

<DESC>The previous sources sought notice under VANAC-SSN-121902C is amended to correct the notice to read as follows:=20 IF YOU WOULD LIKE A MORE EASILY READABLE COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT SUE PROCTOR AT 708-786-5182 OR SUSAN.PROCTOR@MED.VA.GOV SUBJ:  Sources Sought Notice for Medical/Surgical Items=20 This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA=92s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date. =20 Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process.=20 Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria. =20 NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED (INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF ANY KITS) MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559.=20 All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer=92s name.=20 Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.=20 In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.  If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183.  Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples.  If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract. The VHA Medical/Surgical User Group, a group of VA physicians, nurses, and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable. =20 **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Acquisition and Analysis Service (049A5S), ATTN:=20 Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141** =20 SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN JANUARY 20, 2003.

<RESPDATE>011003
<CONTACT>Cynthia Eng, Contract Specialist, (973) 724-5969
<DESC>CBD ANNOUNCEMENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL SOURCES SOUGHT Purpose: 	To assess interest of industry and academia in becoming members  of an industry/academia consortium to form a National Small Arms Center  with the U.S. Army.  A major goal of this consortium will be to improve  U.S. industry, university and Government capabilities as required to  sustain U.S. military supremacy in research, development, engineering and production of hand guns, shoulder fired weapons, grenade launchers,  machine guns, grenade machine guns, automatic cannons and other ground weapons/devices such as lightweight acoustic and directed energy weapons.  Also included are small arms ammunition; hand, gun launched and rocket  grenades; fire control; embedded computers; power supplies; fuzing and  the soldier/gun/vehicle interface. Background: 	Small arms weapons and ammunition technology and facilities are  in serious jeopardy due to a long period of reduced Defense spending and  the restructuring and downsizing of Government, industrial and university capabilities.  Conventional small arms weapons and ammunition technology  is a core capability that must be sustained to meet our military needs  around the world.   The Center of Excellence will be under the management of the Program  Manager for the Joint Services Small Arms Program and is cosponsored by  the PEO Soldier; PEO Ammunition; U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command - Rock Island (TACOM-RI), the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and  TACOM-Armaments, Research and Development Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC).  The other Services and other Government agencies will be invited to join  the Center in the coming months. The Center will be located at TACOM-ARDEC although in operation it is a virtual center that will leverage the assets and capabilities of its Government sponsors and industry and academia partners.   TACOM-ARDEC serves as the Army's focal point and authority for research development, test and evaluation of small arms weapons system designs, optimization of lethality, durability, reliability and ease of use; and development and application of computer models and simulations to all  aspects of weapons system design.  TACOM-ARDEC is also the Department of  the Army and the Army Materiel command's lead laboratory for energetic materials and for transitioning small arms weapons and ammunition to production.   	The sponsors have partnered and continue to partner with a number  of universities and industries on many diverse activities in the areas of  Small Arms Weapons Systems.  The Army would like to build upon this  partnering activity with academia, industry and other profit and non-profit organizations to address the Army's long-range goals in the area of small  arms weapons systems.  Description. 	The partnership/consortium will perform research, development and engineering activities, which address the Army's long-range goals in the  areas indicated above.  The purpose of this consortium is to define collaborative efforts that advance the technology and scientific and engineering skills in the areas that are required to develop, upgrade and produce weapons and ammunition which support the Army's current and  future requirements.  The role of the Government will be to directly participate in these collaborative efforts, to provide partial or full  funding, and share expertise and facilities.  It is expected that the  non-Government collaborators will share in the funding of the National  Small Arms Center of Excellence, contribute their own financial and  personnel resources and under special instances, materials, facilities, equipment or instrumentation. 	It is envisioned that these objectives will be accomplished  through the use of an “Other Transaction Agreement (OTA)” (Section 845  of the 1994 Defense Appropriations Act and amendments) between the Army  and the consortium, where each consortium member participates in  accordance with a Consortium Management Agreement (CMA).  The CMA will  define the purpose, goals and responsibilities of the members including  how the members will address intellectual property. The consortium may consist of industry (large and small businesses), universities, and non-profit organizations working with PM JSSAP  personnel and other Government sponsors utilizing their own facilities  or TACOM-ARDEC laboratories and facilities.  The level of funding from  the Government is estimated to be $1.5M - $3.0M the first year.  The term of the agreement is expected to be for at least 5 years with provisions for renewal. A major goal of this consortium is to improve U.S. industry, Government  and university capabilities to sustain U.S. military supremacy in the  research, development, engineering and production of small arms weapons  and ammunition.  Consequently, the consortium will be open to qualified  U.S. and foreign-owned organizations to foster the largest technical  impact; however, the preference will be for the work to be performed in  the U.S.  The members must have a Secret clearance and comply with U.S.  Army Security, Safety and Environmental requirements and export laws. The Center will engage in broad areas of research and development leading  to prototypes to include weapon systems, subassemblies such as fire  control, fuzing and power supplies, materials and material behavior,  coatings, manufacturing science and technology, modeling and simulation  and failure analyses.  The Center will also foster specialized education  and training as necessary consistent with the goals of the Center. PM JSSAP would like to receive feedback and an expression of interest to include your reasons in the form of a White Paper.  The White Paper should outline your proposed approach and scope of effort in the partnership / consortium with the Army.  In addition it should address the following  areas: 1.  An expression of interest to include your specific area of interest. 2.  Approach to managing, safeguarding and sharing intellectual property. 3.  Liability considerations and proposed approach or limitations. 4.  Technology transfer benefits you visualize for yourself and the  Government. 5.  Special facilities, scientific and engineering knowledge and expertise  you could bring to the partnership/consortium. 6.	Proposed membership and operating structure of the Consortium to include legal preferences regarding the structure. 7.	Questions you may have or additional information that should be presented at the Industry Day briefing prior to releasing a Request for Proposal.   Administration: Please respond to this announcement with an expression of interest by  January 10, 2003 and a White Paper by Jan 10, 2003.  White Papers are to  be no more than 8 pages long, should be in Microsoft Word and shall be submitted via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Cindy Eng, ceng@pica.army.mil, (973) 724-5969.   Industry Day is scheduled for January 22, 2003 at The Garden Inn Hilton,  375 Mount Hope Avenue, Rockaway, New Jersey 07866 ((20 rooms have been  blocked for this event—call for reservations: (973) 328-0600)) commencing  at 0830 hours.  Please advise Barbara J. Byrnes, eme1bmt@aol.com,  (703) 212-8030, Joe Taglairino (973) 724-3417 or Dr. Stephen C. Small, ssmall@pica.army.mil (973) 724-7043 of your intent to attend Industry Day  NLT January 15, 2002. Security:   IMPORTANT: All foreign nationals must submit an embassy request no later  than 10 January 2003. Canadians may apply by way of the Joint Certification Program. In either case the security POC is Kevin Perry (973) 724-2933.  The Government will not pay for this information nor award a contract  based on your submission.  The Market Survey will be used by the Army to  assess interest in becoming a member of an industry/academia consortium  to form a National Small Arms Center.

<DESC>A U.S. Government lease for Federal Court use, located in San Francisco, California, together with associated security requirements, including a dedicated elevator, will expire within 2 years of the date of this notice. The current space consists of courtrooms and associated support space.  The Government will consider alternative replacement space if the alternative space is economically advantageous. The required replacement space must total approximately 39,000 BOMA usable square feet, plus 4 indoor secured parking spaces with internal access to the Premises.

Economically advantageous means that the total cost to the government for fully built out and secured space (including the amortized cost of all required Tenant Improvements) will not exceed an effective total annual rent of $1,560,000 over the firm term of the lease.  In considering whether alternative space is economically advantageous, the government will consider, in addition to lease costs, the costs of relocating from the present location to the alternative location, the cost of relocating and/or duplicating existng telecommunications and data infrastructure, and other relocation or one-time costs.

The term of the lease will be for 10 years, five years firm.  There will be no guarantee, and should be no expectation, that the lease will be renewed or extended.

The area of consideration is located in the city of San Francisco, California within the following boundaries:  From the corner of Market Street and Pine Street, west along Pine Street to Sansome Street, south to Market Street, east to First Street, South to Mission Street, east to Spear Street, south to Harrison Street, east to the Embarcadero, north to Market Street, west to origin.

In considering whether alternative space can be provided within the limitations set forth, potential offerors are advised that: If the space is located above the first floor, the offeror must provide a dedicated elevator for exclusive use of the Court, and configured in such a manner as to lock out all other floors from access by the dedicated elevator and lock out access to court leased space from all other building elevators.  In addition, offerors are advised that TI costs for fully built out court space have been reasonably estimated at no less than $100 per rentable square foot.

Offerors who believe they can develop and present a viable proposal to provide the necessary amount and type of space, meeting all the foregoing requirements, for a rental cost to the Government not exceeding the previously stated limitation should contact the government representative identified below.  Responses to this notice must be received by 5:00 PM, December 30, 2002.

<SUBJECT>16 -- INDUSTRY DAY NOTIFICATION
<DESC>A. The Air Force intends to host an industry day meeting on 23 January 2003, to conduct market research for the Logistics Management Directorate?s Landing Gear Competitive Items Strategic Sourcing Initiative (SSI).  The goal of the SSI is to enhance responsiveness to customer demands through increased parts availability, reductions in administrative and production lead times, higher quality and overall cost effectiveness.  The initial procurement effort under this SSI is for the acquisition of landing gear pistons, outer cylinders and related components for the A-10, B-1, B-52, C-130, C-5, F-15, F-16, F-5, KC-135, and T-38 weapon systems.  A listing of the items currently considered for inclusion will be posted to the Hill Contracting web site (http://contracting.hill.af.mil/ktrhomepage.htm) under the ?Business Opportunities? link, no later than 03 Jan 03.  B. The planned draft Request for Proposal (RFP) release is April 2003, with final RFP release in May 2003.  This competitive acquisition is intended to result in long-term (4-10 year) business arrangements with the successful offeror(s) and an estimated annual requirement in excess of $10 million.  The indefinite delivery contracts are expected to be firm-fixed-price arrangements with option-year pricing and possible award term considerations.  It is anticipated at least a portion of the acquisition will be set-aside for small business.  C.  Items being considered for this acquisition are of a critical nature and require potential sources to successfully complete source qualification prior to any contract award.  Completion of the specified pre-contract award qualification requirements will assure the government that the offeror is capable of producing the item in compliance with the applicable technical specification/data and within the schedule and economic constraints of the government?s contracts.  There are sufficient technical and schedule risks, which can only be minimized by a completion of the requirements prior to contract award.  D.  The industry day meeting will be held at Hill AFB, Utah, Building 1289, PK Main Conference Room, beginning at 0830 on 23 January 2003.  A draft agenda and maps to the building will be posted to this website as separate documents.  E.  Interested parties are encouraged to complete the marketing survey included as a separate document on this web site.  This information will be used, in part, to assist our planning for industry day and insure the government is prepared to answer potential offerors? questions and concerns.  Unless specifically marked, information provided to the government will be considered unlimited in usage rights.  The government will not pay for any information submitted as a result of this industry day notice.  With the exception of attendee information for base access purposes, submission of the information is voluntary and is not a requirement for attendance at the industry day conference.  Completed surveys, additional questions, and attendee information should be submitted to the government no later than 4:00 p.m. MST, 16 Jan 03.  Interested companies are offered the opportunity to schedule one-on-one meetings with the government team, in accordance with times posted on the agenda.  Appointment times must be arranged in advance of the industry day meeting and will be no longer than 20 minutes in length.  F.

<SUBJECT>68 -- National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) Enterococci
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award an IDIQ, commercial type contract on a non-competitive, sole-source basis to Trek Diagnostic Systems for the delivery of lab supplies for the period of one Base Year and two Option Years.  The FDA intends to purchase the following custom plate configurations and lab supplies during the Base Year: 1,070 boxes Custom Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) Plates for Enterococcus, S/W, 10 per box; 111 boxes Mueller Hinton Broth 11ml, 100 per box; 111 boxes Demineralized Water, 100 per box; 111 Doseheads for use with Autoinoculator, 100 per box; 13 boxes 10ul loops, 1000 per box; 7 Backup Tapes for SAMS Computer.  These items will be used by the Government in unique Sensititre microtiter plate reading systems which require supplies specific to this equipment.  The supplies are only available through the manufacturer, Trek Diagnostic Systems.  In order to maintain the consistent testing of isolates and comparability of data, NARMS participating sites must continue to use products from Trek Diagnostic Systems.  Changing testing methodology would bias the reporting of susceptibility results and preclude trend analysis of NARMS data thus severely limiting the Government?s ability to respond to emerging resistance problems and outbreaks of resistant zoonotic enteric disease.  Trek Diagnostics specializes in antimicrobial susceptibility testing of human and animal pathogens and their products provide specific antimicrobial drugs, as well-defined endpoints, organism growth requirements, and high drug potency.  The closing date of this announcement is January 6, 2003.  The NAICS is 325413.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has the responsibility of performing Background Investigations on personnel selected to enter on duty with USAID and to update security clearances on personnel already on board.  A Contract Background Investigation Program has been established to contract these Investigations out to trained and experienced investigators, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have 5 years of current experience conducting personnel security Background Investigations.  

Contractors are required to conduct personnel Single Scope Background Investigations (SSBI), Periodic Reinvestigations (SSBI-PR) and other personnel security-related investigations under this Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).  Background Investigations will be conducted in full compliance with Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, Security Policy Board Issuance's I-97 and 2-97, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Right to Financial Privacy Act and other relevant regulations, and USAID/SEC policies and procedures which will be made known to the Contractor.  Investigations shall further comply with the standards and requirements prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management in the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), Chapters 731 through 736.

Contractors must have, or be able to obtain, a Top Secret security clearance based on a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation to be considered for award. Contractors must be willing to undergo orientation training and attend periodic training conferences in the Washington, DC area.

Contractors will be assigned to a Primary Regional Area (PRA) in reasonable proximity to their residence (to the extent possible, within a 150-mile radius of the residence) where the majority of their work will be performed.  Nonetheless, the Contractor must be available to accept work involving travel to other PRAs and/or anywhere in the United States and Overseas locations. Work assignments will be made on the basis of workload and/or financial considerations as the needs of USAID dictate.  It is preferred that the Special Agent possesses a current U.S. passport in order to accept work that requires overseas travel. 

With each investigation call/order, Contractors shall be tasked to complete the following investigative coverage (leads):
- Schedule and conduct a Personal Interview of applicant;
  Verify identity and citizenship status;  
  Verify employment during the past 5 to 7 years through records   and interviews; 
  Verify claims of residence during the past 3 years through   records and interviews;  
  Verify statements of educational achievement through records and   interviews;
  Conduct interviews of references; 
  Conduct interviews of ex-spouses;
  Conduct Local Agency (law enforcement agency) Checks (LACS); 
  Verification of public records, divorce, bankruptcy,   civil/criminal actions;  
  Expand the investigation, as necessary; 
  Security or other types of Special Investigations will normally   be conducted in close association with Security Branch     management.  Special projects related to investigative/operational case management may be required.

Contractors will be expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Completion of at least three (3) investigations per month is required and mandatory upon the availability of assignments.  Performance reviews will be conducted on an annual basis. 

It is preferred that Contractors be computer literate and proficient in a word processing application, preferably Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, for the preparation of Reports of Investigation and other relevant correspondence and forms.  Knowledge of Microsoft Excel is desirable for the preparation of vouchers and other forms.  
 
Each call order will specify the following: 

(1) The work to be performed by the Contractor; 
(2) The place(s) where the work is to be performed; 
(3) An effective date and a completion date of the order; 
(4) The number or work hours ordered; 
(5) The fixed hourly rate; 
(6) A fixed price which shall constitute the  maximum obligations of the Government to the Contractor for performance of the order and, 
(7) where applicable to the specific order, Government furnished property and/or logistical support will be provided to the Contractor.

Contractors shall be paid for authorized services provided at the fixed hourly rate of $33.00, plus authorized expenses.  The hourly rate will increase by $1.00 per hour effective for all Orders issued on or after the first day of each fiscal year.  Higher hourly rates are payable for priority designated work when specifically authorized.  Rate adjustments will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. 

The Contract Line Items will be split into costs for Background Investigative Services and Other Direct Costs (i.e., travel) for each call order.  Each Order will contain (in addition to the fixed hourly rate), other authorized direct costs necessary for the performance of the work including travel and transportation, per diem or subsistence.  

When specifically authorized, per diem and expenses will be paid for required travel.  Applicable per diem rates shall be in accordance with Federal Travel Regulation, Title 41 CFR, Chapter 301. 

All applicants will be responsible to register with the designated Financial Management company, as applicable. 

USAID intends to issue to multiple vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2007.  Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a Blanket Purchase Agreement.  A Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is not a contract.  A Blanket Purchase Agreement is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  The purchase limit of each call/order shall not exceed $5,000,000 in accordance with FAR Part 13.5 collectively.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the USAID representative.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services. 

The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force: FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror - Commercial Items (Oct. 00) is incorporated by reference, applies to this acquisition.  Clause 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 99) Evaluation. Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items.  Incorporated by reference are FAR 52.212.1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial. 

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

The USAID will award  BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on  past performance and experience, and the vendor's acceptability (the acceptance of  USAID's terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as passed will be assessed points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of  at least 65 will be considered for issuance of a BPA.

a. 	Experience (60 Points)  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  USAID will evaluate each vendor's experience on the basis of its breath, it depth, and its relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA.  Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting investigations in the federal environment, experience conducting personnel security investigations (including overseas experience), experience with or exposure to Foreign Affairs Agencies, computer proficiency.

b.	Past Performance  (40 Points)  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  The USAID will contact some of the vendor's customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, USAID will contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases. USAID will assess the vendor's  communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. 

Contractors with recent USAID experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided USAID.  USAID will consider performance contractors have previously rendered to USAID to be more influential than past performance for another source.

c. Acceptability.  The USAID will determine the acceptability of each offer on a pass or fail basis.  An offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor's assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the RFP, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If an vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, the USAID will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so. 


Offerors wishing to respond shall submit a current resume with your SSN as well as all the requested information within the content of this solicitation initially by January 10, 2003.  This solicitation will be open throughout the period of this blanket purchase agreement.  All proposals received after this initial date will be evaluated on a quarterly basis.  All responsible sources may submit an offer of interest throughout this time period.  Only written requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable.  (No phone calls will be accepted.)  
Proposals are to be submitted via mail at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Room 7.10-061, Washington, DC 20523.  POC: Gwendolyn Ruffin.  The proposed procurement is 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns.
