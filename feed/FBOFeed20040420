<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia intends to award a cost-reimbursement type contract to a qualified offeror for a “Strengths Based Case Management Training for ARTAS Demonstration Project.”   The purpose of this contract is to develop a curriculum and a training manual, and deliver training for case managers who are doing linkage case management.  The curriculum and training manual will apply to multiple case manager settings in U.S. communities.  The training will be of 10-18 case managers employed by the Antiretroviral Treatment and Access Study (ARTAS) demonstration cooperative agreement.  The curriculum and training manual needs to be general enough to apply to case managers employed by a variety of U.S. agencies (community organizations, health departments, etc.) that have been delivering case management services to HIV-infected individuals.  The main focus of the training component is to give case managers the skills needed to help clients identify strengths and resources useful in linkage to care.  The training should incorporate a strengths-based methodology in order to assist clients in identifying resources that will allow them to engage in HIV care.  This training should give new case managers adequate knowledge and skills needed to function independently and with very little supervision.  The training is designed to complement the demonstration project described below.  The recipient of this contract will need to produce a manual that will incorporate the curriculum that could be used by future organizations doing such training, as well as specifics related to how a case manager should perform linkage case management.  The training shall include case managers from each site selected for the ARTAS demonstration project.  It is anticipated that up to nine sites will be selected to participate in the ARTAS demonstration project.  A final list of the sites will be provided to the successful offeror upon award.   The date specified for receipt of offers will be approximately 30 days after the solicitation issue date, on or about June 8, 2004.  The performance period under this contract will be two (2) years from date of contract award.  The NAICS code is 541690 and only proposals received from small business concerns will be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Notes 1 and 26.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available; however, the solicitation will be available for retrieval at www.fedbizopps.gov, on or about May 6, 2004.  It will be the responsibility of individual offerors to monitor the above website for additional postings regarding this solicitation.  Telephonic/facsimile requests will not be accepted.

The vendor will develop new Web pages in AST.Net with maximum validations for VA clinic inputs.

The new Web pages must be interactive.  It must be capable of allowing registration of new patients with ICD devices, their personal information, device information, medical information, and allow updating and/or revising of the same and retrieval of other selected information by using query searches of relational database. The VA Web administrators will have the ability to change passwords or create new passwords for users. Additionally, the successful vendor will have to review existing Paceart SQL 2000 relational data for understanding of the data base structure, tables, relationship between tables and field names.  The data from the web input pages initially flows into a temporary SQL 2000 database for review and revision/correction of errors, prior to parsing (electronic movement) to an existing permanent SQL 2000 relational database.  The new Web pages and programming shall become the property of the VA.  The VA administrator is willing to provide a CD of existing web pages in ASP (without data), and will work with successful vendor in identifying and mapping tales/fields in the existing SQL 2000 relational database, and will assist fully in the testing of the new Web page data to insure it flows into the existing Paceart SQL 2000 database. The successful vendor may have to sign a Business Associates Agreement and may have under go a security clearance background investigation.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Administrative Support Center intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sea Island Software, Mt. Pleasant, SC for the development of an Inland Flooding Operational Module of the HURREVAC Model.  The HURREVAC Model is a product of the Hurricane Evacuation Studies conducted in every U. S. coastal state and territory.  It was developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U. S. Army Corp of Engineers (USACE), and the National Weather Service (NWS), and is a restricted-use program used by federal, state, and local government emergency managers since 1988 to track hurricanes to assist in decision-making for their communities.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Procurement by less than full and open competition is necessary because this work is an expansion of activities currently being conducted by Sea Island Software for FEMA and USACE.  Sea Island Software developed the current HURREVAC model, makes updates to the model to address user needs, provides training on the model, and operationally maintains the system 24 hours a day, seven days a week during hurricane season.  The applicable NAICS is 541519. This action is estimated above the simplified acquisition threshold.  Note 22 applies.

Contractors shall submit a one page letter of interest on company letter head.  This letter shall include a statement of interest, DUNS number, number of personnel that will attend the Pre-proposal conference (maximum of 2) and a copy of a valid business license.  Letters are due to the office of the Contracting Officer no later than January  23rd, 2004.  Send letters to the attention of Carrie Haman, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration (GSA), Gulf Coast Service Center, (7PEG-FW), Room 12A5, 819 Taylor St., Fort Worth, Texas 76102.  GSA retains the right to publish and distribute the list of offerors (bidders list) to other interested parties (i.e., subcontractors, etc.).  The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $48,000,000 to $54,000,000.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is scheduled to be issued on or about January 30th, 2004.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit is tentatively scheduled to be held February 11th, 2004 in Houston, Texas to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the price and technical evaluation criteria.  Attendance at the Pre-proposal conference is not mandatory.  GSA intends to contract for complete construction services with construction contractors that offer the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.  The proposed project will be constructed on a ten acre site within the city limits of Houston, Texas.  This project is a new Field Office for the Houston Division of the FBI located near the intersection of Hwy 290 and West 43rd Street in northwest Houston, Texas.  The scope of this project includes but is not limited to the construction of an eight-story, cast-in-place concrete Office Building topped by a steel framed penthouse both totaling approximately 22,300 gross square meters.  The Office Building has a double exterior wall.  The inner, weather tight wall consists of the concrete structural wall with a metal panel covering.  Punched windows in this wall are aluminum frames with insulating glass.  The outer wall consists of laminated glass panels on a steel support structure cantilevered 40 inches from the concrete structure.  This outer wall is not weather or air tight and acts as a sunshade for the building.  To the north of the Office Building, the project also includes a single-story Annex Building of approximately 4,700 gross square meters.  The southern half of this building houses office functions and is cast-in-place concrete.  The northern half is a steel frame structure housing vehicle repair bays.  The entire exterior is clad with metal panel to match the office building.  The first floor areas of the Office and Annex are served by an overhead HVAC air distribution system.  Floors 2 through 8 of the Office take advantage of the access floor system and HVAC is provided by an under-floor air distribution system.  Along the north side of this site is a three-level pre-cast concrete Parking Garage of approximately 21,000 gross square meters housing approximately 673 cars.  A Guard Building will be included at one of 2 site entries.  Both entries are equipped with vehicle deterrent systems.  The site includes an approximately 3 ft. high concrete wall and is backed up by earth berms.  A 6 ft. high metal fence rests on top of this concrete wall.  Surface parking is provided on the site for approximately 72 vehicles.  The project is designed to comply with a Certification Level according to the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) Rating System.  Occupancy of the field office is planned for the late Fall of 2006.  This procurement is advertised on an unrestricted basis.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 233320.  The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract.  The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value/Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price.  The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire project including the administrative cost of processing change orders throughout the course of this project.  The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.202), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The entire procurement process will be performed in two (2) stages.  The successful offeror will be based on accumulative scores for both stages.  Stage I Submission Requirements: Request for Proposal (RFP) for technical documents from those firms responding to this CBD announcement.  Any scope changes by the Government that result from the pre-proposal conference or any other discussions may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission (Stage II) at no recompense to the offeror(s).  The technical factors will be as follows: (#1) Past Performance on Similar Projects; (#2) Experience on Similar Projects; (#3) Detailed Management Plan and Technical Approach; and (#4) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel of the Prime.  Following the evaluation of the technical proposals, a competitive range of offerors that offer the best values will be selected in accordance with FAR Part 15.306(c) to further compete in Stage II.  Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvement measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Stage I, or II shall become the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the drawings and specifications for use under this project at no recompense to the offeror(s).  Stage I submittal requirements are due into the office of the Contracting Officer no later than close of business March 1st, 2004.  Stage II Submission: Only firms selected within the competitive range will enter into this phase of the solicitation.  

This project will require certain security measures be adhered to.  Protocols involving security background investigations have been implemented to establish that Government contractors, licensees, certificate holders, and grantees are cleared for access to special information to material.  Therefore, without exception, either restricted/limited security investigations and/or an extensive background investigation is being conducted on all individuals working on this project.  The information provided by each individual for their background investigation is voluntary and the processing may affect security clearance prospects if not completed in a timely matter, or if each item of information requested is not provided.  In addition to questions on the security application form, successful Stage I offerors may be asked to bring documents about information provided on the security clearance form or other matters requiring further explanation.  Additionally, successful stage I offerors may also be required to participate in a personal interview as a routine course of the investigative process.  This interview will provide an opportunity to update, clarify, and explain information on the security application form more completely, if necessary.  The interview generally conducted following review of submitted information, often helps to expedite and complete the investigation.  

The level of effort in the Stage II phase includes the following: (#1) Subcontractor Qualifications; (#2) mandatory, proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR Part 19.7 encompassing the following Socio-Economic Program minimum goals: Small Business (40%), Small Disadvantaged Business (8%), Small Women-Owned Business (5%), HUBZone Business (3%), Service-disabled Veteran-owned business (2%) and Veteran-owned (3%); and (#3) price proposal.  Failure to submit and/or comply with the minimum requirements of the Subcontracting Plan will render the offeror unacceptable.  Stage II submittal requirements are due into the office of the Contracting Officer no later than close of business August 23rd,  2004.  GSA shall schedule two site visit opportunities during this stage.  All questions/clarifications regarding the project documents (drawings, specifications, procedures, etc.) shall be put in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than close of business August 9th, 2004.  All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the solicitation number GS-07P-04-URC-1003.  Following the Pre-Proposal Conference that is scheduled during Stage I, the General Services Administration (GSA) will host a Subcontracting Opportunities Networking Session for Small, Small Disadvantaged, Minority, Woman-Owned, HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned businesses.  The session is tentatively scheduled on February 11th, 2004.

Attendance at these sessions is not mandatory.  The Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between the community and the firms, which are considering bidding on this project.  Prospective small business subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with potential prime contractors and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.  A Bidders list will be made available to all participants at the networking sessions.  Pre-registration by February 4th, 2004 is requested.  Questions about the Networking Session and Registration information should be directed to LaVida Barnes , GSA Office of Enterprise Development (817) 978-0800 or fax to (817) 978-0440; Internet lavida.barnes@gsa.gov.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.

<DESC>The Naval Air System Command, Patuxent River MD, intends to award a sole source cost type order against Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-03-G-0003 to United Technologies, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) in support of the MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter Program. This effort will replace the existing MH-60R Halon fire extinguishing system with non-ozone depleting substance, which will have the same level of fire extinguishing capacity/efficiency as the current system. SAC shall provide the preliminary design and analysis necessary to futher define the non-Halon aircraft engine and APU Fire Extinguishing system and the aircraft modifications required to implement the candidate system selected in Phase I. Phase II will result in the delivery of a risk reduction test article that can be used to accurately simulate an H-60 engine nacelle fire, a non-Halon fire extinguishing system prototype which will be installed in the test article and associated test plans and test data results. Phase II of this effort will include updating the MH-60R design, including technical publications and drawings, to incorporate the Halon replacement system and conducting final qualification testing.  As the sole designer of the MH-60R air vehicle, SAC is the only known source with the knowledge, experience, and data to perform this effort. To award this contract to another vendor would result in excessive duplication of effort and costs to the Government. See note 22.

Expertise regarding UXO excavation via manual, mechanized, and remote-controlled mechanized methods is required.  Knowledge and ability on remediating UXO and other constituents found in soil and groundwater is required in regard to current techniques common in the field such as blow-in-place and contained detonation chamber, as well as techniques presently more commonly found in industrial settings such as rotary kilns and deactivation furnaces.  Experience with UXO safety requirements, render-safe procedures, and the ability to efficiently coordinate with active duty EOD personnel is needed.
Firms will be evaluated in terms of their quality of work, customer focus and demonstrated long-term business relationships with Government and private industry.  As appropriate, superior performance evaluations on recently completed Department of Defense contracts will be considered. Provide information regarding previous working relationships with proposed team subcontractors. A name and phone number should be provided for each reference.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to complete the process of reestablishing its capacity for research in cardiothoracic surgery (CTS) and to integrate this program with ongoing acute care research on patients who present in the early hours of heart attack and stroke.  The Institute plans to link with Suburban Hospital’s clinicians and acute care patient base as part of the research conducted by its Clinical Research Program (CRP), Division of Intramural Research.  NHLBI’s cardiothoracic surgery capabilities within the Institute were phased out over 10 years ago for a variety of reasons.  During that time surgeries were performed under contract on an as needed basis only for patients enrolled in CRP protocols.  Those protocols were not for research on CTS itself.  Changes in CTS in recent years require evaluation and further development of innovative surgical techniques.  Also, changes in policies, regulations, and treatment combine with the changes in CTS to highlight the positive benefits that interaction between basic science and clinical investigations have created .  Ongoing and frequent interaction between clinicians and patients at Suburban Hospital, and basic scientists at NHLBI, will bring the changes in CTS and acute cardiac care into clinical practice more quickly through an integrated research approach.

The goal of the CTS Branch in the NHLBI is to conduct innovative clinical research that will advance the field and to train cardiothoracic surgeons in research methodologies and techniques.  The NHLBI plans an approach that will build on the established clinical excellence, and will pursue mutually beneficial research collaborations both with Suburban and with other NIH Institutes and Centers.  NIH offers links between basic science and clinical investigations, relative swiftness in translating basic science to clinical usage, access to state-of-the-art animal facilities, presence of multidisciplinary research teams, capability to focus on selected science and health problems, support of a centralized coordinating facility, organization of a center of excellence in clinical research, and ability to provide integrated service delivery.   


NHLBI needs access to an acute care patient base so that the clinical research, applied and basic research, and training and education components it envisions can be integrated with its ongoing program of acute care research to carry out its cardiothoracic surgery research protocols.  Cardiothoracic surgical facilities must be available on a 24 x 7 basis (24 hours per day, 7 days per week) as some of the patients will be admitted on an emergency basis.  Cardiothoracic surgeon(s) and interventional cardiologists will conduct research at the NIH campus and at Suburban Hospital, and will perform cardiothoracic surgery and procedures at Suburban Hospital.  NHLBI also will extend its core role in facilitating and fostering communication and cooperation among clinical and laboratory researchers by establishing locally a CTS fellowship program that then could be extended nationally as slots are available.  Staff and fellows will need to move quickly between the research environment at NIH and the cardiothoracic surgical facility at Suburban.  Therefore, close proximity between the acute care site and the NIH campus (5 minutes driving time or 10 minutes by foot) is required to permit NHLBI clinical and technical staff the ability to respond to acute patient issues in a timely fashion from the NIH campus, and is critical to the success of this project.  

Development of this research infrastructure centered around multidisciplinary core programs and specific research projects will enable the NHLBI to continue to attract the leaders and mentors needed to do the innovative research and help train the next generation of cardiothoracic surgeons.  The research infrastructure will provide the ongoing, day-to-day approach that will facilitate moving results from research into practice.

The NHLBI intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Suburban Hospital for a seven year contract program to provide the acute care component of CTS, if Suburban Hospital receives a Certificate of Need to perform cardiac surgery from the Maryland Health Care Commission.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a Request for Proposals.  See Note 22.

Once the new SARPs are endorsed by the Member States, ICAO will encourage its membership to amend relevant provisions of their national aviation legislation and codes in order to facilitate the creation of the regulatory instruments needed to operate services in accordance with the requirements of the new system.  Currently it is envisaged that the CNS/ATM system will be up and running in many states by the year 2010.  Although technically this goal is achievable, there are many non-technical issues that will likely delay the implementation of key components of the system.

At present, the service providers in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan have agreed, in principle, to the establishment of a regional organization that will develop a consensus of opinion on subjects related to the development of regional plans for upgrading their national ATM facilities and services.  The establishment of such an organization, with appropriate responsibilities and decision-making authority, is deemed to be an important step in a planning process that will eventually require states to make certain concessions regarding the operation of their national ATM systems in order to realize the full range of benefits that are expected from the implementation of a regional satellite-based system.

The ATM systems in the five countries are at similar stages in their development, with the exception of Kazakhstan.  Due to its large size, Kazakhstan’s needs differ from those of its neighbors.  All of the ATM service providers in these countries are organized as state enterprises and all are ICAO member states.  With the exception of Kazakhstan, each can retain only a portion of their earnings generated by over-flight fees to cover operating and infrastructure development expenses.  All of the governments, through their designated air service providers, have completed limited ATM system upgrades. Kazakhstan has gone further, implementing a number of costly investment programs for the purpose of upgrading levels of safety and efficiency in its ATM system.  The enhancements, both in place and planned, include the acquisition of new air traffic control radars, communications equipment and navigational aids.

The primary aim of this project is to assist the five states with the implementation of the new CNS/ATM system.  The project is expected to help with the creation of CNS/ATM system development plans that will address both national and regional issues.  The ultimate aim of the project will be the development of well-coordinated planning documents that will lead to the efficient and cost-effective implementation of the new ATM system.  
 
The U.S. firm selected to conduct this technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $545,015 grant to the Kazaeronavigatsia from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Kazaeronavigatsia also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  Kazaeronavigatsia is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES

DATE: APRIL 20, 2004

REQUISITION NO: 04M000132

INTENDED SOURCE: WESTERN INTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION (WICHE)

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: DATE OF AWARD THROUGH TWELVE MONTHS

PURPOSE:

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, OFFICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES, SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION , THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER, PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO WICHE. CLOSING DATE IS MAY 4, 2004.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS:

CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION OF SAMHSA/CMHS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT’S  NEW FREEDOM COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTH REPORT, ACHIEVING THE PROMISE:  TRANSFORMING MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA, TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PROVIDERS OF MENTAL HEALTH IN RURAL AMERICA, SAMHSA/CMHS PROPOSES A VIRTUAL GRAND ROUNDS SERIES, CONDUCTED VIA ELECTRONIC WEBCAST, TO PROVIDE RURAL AND FRONTIER MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH PRACTITIONERS WITH ACCESS TO TRAINING ON KEY TOPICS EMERGENT IN MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICE TODAY.  THE WEBCAST FORMAT WILL PROVIDE FOR REAL-TIME AND ASYNCHRONOUS TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND CREATE, OVER TIME, AN ARCHIVE OF TRAINING MATERIAL FOR THE FIELD.

BACKGROUND:

THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION(SAMHSA) WAS CREATED IN 1992 TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STATES TO IMPROVE PREVENTION, TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS.  WITHIN SAMHSA THE CENTER FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES (CMHS) PROVIDES NATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTION FOR POLICIES, PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH PREVENTION AND TREATMENT FOR SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THEIR FAMILIES, AND PEOPLE AT RISK OF MENTAL ILLNESS, STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS TO IMPROVE AND ENHANCE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT, ILLNESS PREVENTION, AND SUPPORT SERVICES PLACING THEM WITHIN THE REACH OF ALL AMERICANS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO RESIDE IN RURAL AREAS.

WORKFORCE SHORTAGES IN MENTAL HEALTH ARE A NATIONAL PROBLEM AND PARTICULARLY SEVERE IN LARGELY RURAL STATES. AN ESTIMATED 60 MILLION AMERICANS LIVE IN RURAL AREAS OF AMERICA AND THE RATES OF MENTAL DISORDERS ARE NO LESS THAN IN URBAN OR SUBURBAN AREAS.  THE PRESIDENT’S NEW FREEDOM COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTH INCLUDED IN THEIR FINAL REPORT A SUBCOMMITTEE REPORT ON UNIQUE PROBLEMS IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE FACING AMERICANS LIVING IN RURAL OR FRONTIER REGION. THE COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL KEY ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH IN RURAL AMERICA:

a. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LACKS A CONSISTENTLY APPLIED DEFINITION OF RURAL AMERICA.

b. THERE ARE CRITICAL GAPS IN ACCESSIBILITY TO SERVICES.
c. THERE ARE CRITICAL SHORTAGES IN THE AVAILABILITY OF PROVIDERS AND PROGRAMS.
d. ACCEPTABILITY OF CARE IS OFTEN IMPAIRED DUE TO URBAN-BASED MODELS AND STRATEGIES.
e. A CLEARLY DEFINED PLAN TO ADDRESS OUT-STANDING RURAL MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES DOES NOT EXIST.
f. MENTAL HEALTH POLICY IS ROUTINELY ESTABLISHED WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF ITS RURAL IMPACT.
	
DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES USE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF RURAL, TYPICALLY BASED ON POPULATION DENSITY AND/OR SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS.  RURAL AMERICA IS OFTEN VIEWED AND DEFINED BY WHAT IT LACKS.  FOR INSTANCE:
	
OVER 85% OF THE 1669 FEDERALLY DESIGNATED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS (MHPSAS) ARE RURAL;
	
MORE THAN 60% OF RURAL AMERICANS LIVE IN MHPSAS;
OVER 90% OF ALL PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PSYCHIATRISTS, AND 80% OF MSWS, WORK EXCLUSIVELY IN METROPOLITAN AREAS.  THE RATIO OF THESE PROVIDERS TO THE POPULATION WORSENS AS RURALITY INCREASES.	
MORE THAN 65% OF RURAL AMERICANS GET THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CARE FROM THEIR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER.
	
WORKFORCE SHORTAGES ARE WORSE FOR SPECIALTY AREAS (E.G., CHILDREN’S MENTAL HEALTH, OLDER ADULT MENTAL HEALTH) AND WERE IDENTIFIED AS A HOLE IN THE SAFETY NET IN A RECENT REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.  FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS SIMILAR REPORTS HAVE DISCUSSED THE PERVASIVE PERCEPTION OF PROFESSIONAL ISOLATION AMONG RURAL AND FRONTIER MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, THE LACK OF SPECIFIC PRE-SERVICE TRAINING TO PREPARE FOR RURAL PRACTICE, AND LACK OF ON-GOING ACCESS TO CONTINUING EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:
	
WICHE IS A FEDERALLY CHARTERED INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION, FOUNDED IN 1953, AND SERVES A SIMPLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD MISSION: TO PROVIDE THE CITIZENS OF THE MEMBER STATES WITH EXPANDED ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION, AND TO DO SO BY PROMOTING INNOVATION, COOPERATION, RESOURCE SHARING, AND SOUND PUBLIC POLICY AMONG OUR STATES AND INSTITUTIONS. WICHE DOES SO NOT FOR THE SAKE OF WESTERN HIGHER EDUCATION, BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE REGION’S SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND CIVIC LIFE, WHICH WILL THRIVE ONLY IF WE PROVIDE BROAD ACCESS TO EXCELLENT HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE REGION.  THE WICHE FOUNDERS BELIEVED A HEALTHY MIND, AND THUS ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE, WAS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT IN PROMOTING THIS MISSION.  THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM WAS AMONG THE FIRST PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMISSION, AND BEGAN OPERATIONS IN 1955.
	
THE WICHE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM SERVES AS A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EVALUATION CENTER, WITH NEARLY A HALF-CENTURY OF EXPERTISE IN RESPONDING TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES.  IT COLLABORATES WITH EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO IDENTIFY AND DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES IN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUPPORTS PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS IN PROGRAM EVALUATION, CLINICAL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT, AND DATA DRIVEN DECISION SUPPORT. THE WICHE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM HAS FOCUSED ON THE TRAINING NEEDS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE IN THE WEST AS A MAJOR PART OF ITS AGENDA FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS. 
	
SINCE  THE EARLY 1980S THE WICHE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM HAS BEEN WORKING TO IMPROVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AND HIGHER EDUCATION. WICHE WAS AT THE FOREFRONT OF PUBIC-ACADEMIC LINKAGE (PAL) PROJECTS. THESE PROJECTS INCLUDED EMPHASES ON CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT RESPONSIVE TO THE MISSION OF PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH; RESEARCH LED BY ACADEMIA WITH THE OBJECTIVE TO TRANSLATE FINDINGS INTO PRACTICE;  TELECOMMUNICATION STRATEGIES TO EXTEND UNIVERSITY-BASED EXPERTISE TO PRACTICING MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE RURAL WEST; AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CURRICULA FOR TWO-YEAR COLLEGES TO BETTER SERVE THE WORKFORCE NEEDS OF THEIR PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES.
	
AS AN INTERSTATE COMPACT ORGANIZATION, WICHE IS A REGIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY AND HAS A GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR MEMBER STATES.  THE WICHE MHP IS UNIQUE IN THIS INTEGRATED LINKAGE TO STATE GOVERNMENTS, STATE MENTAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES, AND HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE WEST, AND AFFORDS A VERY EFFECTIVE FOUNDATION TO BUILD WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.  THE WESTERN COOPERATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION (WCET) IS A PARALLEL WICHE PROGRAM.  AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED LEADER IN THE USE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN HIGHER EDUCATION, THE RESOURCES OF WCET ARE ESPECIALLY UNIQUE TO THE PROJECT PROPOSED TO CMHS, AND ADD A LEVEL OF EXPERTISE SIMPLY UNAVAILABLE TO MOST ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH DIRECT RELATIONSHIP. 
	
THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.

<SOLNBR>SP0200-04-R-5006
<CONTACT>Eileen Motta, Contract Specialist, Phone 215-737-7243, Fax 215-737-8139, Email Eileen.Motta@dla.mil
<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to enter into a long-term Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract to support the worldwide demand for Abbott Immunoassay, Hematology, I-STAT and Medisense Diagnostic Reagents.  Through Market Research it has been determined that Abbott diagnostic reagents are specifically configured to support Abbott’s testing systems employed at the Military Treatment Facilities. No other manufacturer or distributors sells or has access to these products manufactured by Abbott Laboratories.  It has been determined that there is only one known manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories, who has the capability of providing the required items.
This solicitation will require Abbott to submit a catalog detailing all of the diagnostic reagents for each Military Treatment Facility serviced.  All prices for Immunoassay and Hematology reagents must be developed based on the Cost-Per-Test pricing methodology.  Under the Cost- Per-Test pricing methodology Abbott provides the testing equipment to the individual Military Treatment Facilities at no cost to the government.  A “usage fee” to use the equipment is amortized over the reagents that are used on that equipment for a period of 5 years, which is consistent with commercial practice.  Abbott will be asked to provide tables detailing the reagents, add-on options and any additional discounts.  The prices in these tables will be firm-fixed for the duration of the contract.  Abbott, will be required to supply all supporting price documentation (i.e. equipment model, number of machines, equipment service hours, retraining options and the number of cycles per day per patient for Hematology items and the total test for Immunoassay items) needed to perform the Cost-Per-Test calculation and a catalog with an inclusive price for each Military Treatment Facility serviced.  The price for Hematology and Immunoassay reagents may be adjusted annually for those customers who did not meet the previous years annual committed usage volume or who have a change in the amount of equipment or service hours currently rendered.  All increases in catalog prices charged to each customer will be recalculated using the firm-fixed price tables (e.g. reagent, add-on and discount) and the Cost-Per-Test pricing calculation outlined in the Abbott Federal Supply Schedule.  A price decrease can occur any time throughout the life of the contract.

I-STAT reagents are purchased based on quantity tier pricing.  Any customers whose usage falls within one of these quantity tiers will receive the same price for that reagent.  Under this solicitation Abbott will be required to provide a table detailing the I-STAT product line and the tier pricing offered.  They will also be required to submit usage data and a total ECAT price for each customer.  The pricing tables should support the price charged to each customer.  These tables will not be subject to adjustment and shall be firm-fixed for the entire duration of the contract, unless something becomes obsolete and a replacement item is added. The price for I-STAT reagents may be adjusted annually for those customers who have a change in their annual committed usage volume.   A price decrease can occur any time throughout the life of the contract.   
For the Medisense items the contractor shall submit an ECAT price for each facility serviced as part of their catalog.  These prices are firm fixed and are not subject to price adjustments during the life of this contract.
This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  Initially, manufacturer’s will be asked to supply Continental United States (CONUS) catalog, which includes facilities located in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia as well as Alaska and Hawaii and will be implemented first.  The Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog will include facilities located outside the continental United States and will be required in the future.  The prices submitted by Abbott for each Military Treatment Facility serviced will be loaded into the DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of an item inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.
All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Confirmation and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  The contractor is required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgement’s, send 855-Order Confirmation’s, and transmit 810-Invoice’s for payment.  There are (3) three communication option available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface, American National Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI Standard and the Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX).  Abbott Laboratories must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options. They will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.
The contract resultant from this solicitation will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated dollar value of $12.5 million dollars over the total contract period.  Solicitation SP0200-04-R-5006 is expected to become available May 31,2004 and can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.mil/home .

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Statement of Purpose The National Aeronautics and Space Administration seeks an unfunded collaboration or collaborations for creating the ability to easily access archives of NASA’s digital and analog visual media, managing that newly created archive, and providing the Internet interfaces to disseminate that archive widely.	NASA is interested in reviewing proposals from organizations that share NASA’s mission, values, and goals, and that would strategically enhance the Agency’s ability to provide information on NASA’s projects and missions to the public via these media.  For more information on NASA’s vision and mission, please see http://www.nasa.gov. It is intended that this request for entrepreneurial offers will result in the establishment of one or more non-reimbursable agreements that will define the full roles and responsibilities of NASA and the proposing organization(s). Similarly, one proposer could represent a consortium. Scope Much of NASA’s imagery collection is in analog format.	This collaboration (or collaborations) would allow NASA analog and digital assets of motion picture films, photography, exhibit and graphic design material and video (with appropriate audio) from a variety of NASA sources, to be searched, digitized and disseminated via the Internet by a searchable database.  The database would contain imagery metadata to NASA specifications, with thumbnails for still images, exhibit and graphic material, and low resolution streaming video for video and film previews.  Collaborators would be responsible for providing the necessary security to prevent unauthorized access to NASA systems as well as all software or hardware necessary for remote access of existing systems, if required. (This would include protecting the integrity of the content and to prevent the system from being compromised in ways that threaten the availability of the material or which might embarrass the Agency, e.g., to have the site hacked and content replaced with Web "graffiti.”) NASA would offer access to NASA’s various physical and electronic archives as part of this collaboration. In addition, NASA spacecraft, science instruments, as well as other means, will provide a continued source of high-resolution digital imagery.  This database would contain a percentage of these NASA assets with special focus on historical, educational, and commercially viable material for both NASA and the corporate partner. Each of the ten NASA Centers and Headquarters have original imagery.  For instance, there is over 115,000 film and video titles and over 2 million still images that document NASA space missions, astronaut training, flight hardware development, aeronautical research, and other key Center activities.   It is anticipated that this database might serve as the “official” Agency database providing imagery that is searchable and retrievable through one Internet source for a period of 3 years from the successful completion of the milestones and fully integrated database.   The term of this agreement is five years.  This includes the initial 2-year period to develop the database, followed by the 3-year period for the operation, maintenance and management of the database.  NASA will consider proposals to extend the term of the agreement for an additional two years, and the total term of this agreement shall not exceed 7 years. Benefits to Corporate Partners In exchange for the creation and facilitation of the digital dissemination and database of NASA imagery, NASA may consider negotiating brand placement, limited exclusivity, such as “official site” designation, and other opportunities as part of this collaboration.  Creative concepts from the proposer regarding this opportunity will be considered by NASA, along with the effect that these concepts would have on ongoing programs and projects.  For instance, those concepts with minimal NASA labor requirements or with minimal negative impact to the NASA organization and projects will have a higher probability of acceptance.   Consideration only will be given to those offers that are commensurate with the value of the above, and that reflect NASA mission, values and goals.   NASA Requirements and Evaluation Criteria NASA is looking for a collaborator to deliver the following: • Database containing a percentage of NASA imagery assets, as described under “Scope.” • Low-resolution imagery free of charge to the general public, “breaking news” images to the media for a limited time, and limited amounts of material to educators and educational institutions.  • High-resolution imagery and database access to NASA personnel, including those working on NASA projects, free of charge. • Ability to integrate the low-resolution database with the NASA's public Web portal, in accordance with the portal's information architecture and taxonomy.  (For more information, contact Brian Dunbar at 202/358-0873). • Schedule and milestones for delivering the database. • Compliance with appropriate Code of Federal Regulations, e.g. the handling of NASA originals (CFR 36, 1232.20, page 625, and a pamphlet entitled, “managing Audiovisual Records” at http://www.nasa.gov/publications/recsmgmt.html, and with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1972) • Monthly status report with metrics. • Quarterly review meetings. Evaluation Criteria Overview:  Proposals will be evaluated on the capabilities to provide this product and service, the viability of the organization, the level of the team’s experience, the documented experience and success in digital asset management, including but not limited to, digitizing, archiving and controlled dissemination, and the milestones for the completion of the database and its ongoing management plan.  All proposals will be evaluated on the documented success of the organization in the following areas: Technical Ability and Experience: 1. Ability to provide imagery, some without charge as stated above, without compromising the organization’s commercial viability.  2. Success in digitizing analog media, to create and manage a high quantity, easily searchable database of imagery, both still, motion and graphics material, and corresponding metadata, with Internet interfaces. Management Ability: 1. Ability to schedule and meet realistic milestones.   2. Management team experience (include information on location, points of contact and top-level organizational structure.) 3. Projected schedule and milestones for accomplishing project. Financial Stability: 1. Strength of market analysis and strategy analysis. 2. Strength of financial plan and evidence of financial stability (include annual audits, balance sheets and appropriate documentation.) Other: 1. Level of NASA assets and resources requested for the collaboration. 2. Level of prestige of the organization, company and/or other government agency represented, and how its strategy, mission statement, values and goals reflect NASA’s. 3. Level of additional value and benefits offered to NASA. Instructions Submittals should address all the areas to be evaluated as stated under “NASA Requirements and Evaluation Criteria.” The proposal also must identify what the proposer expects NASA to provide in terms of assets and opportunities for the collaboration, as outlined in the section entitled, “Benefits to Corporate Partner.”  This request will be open for six weeks following date of release of this announcement.  All proposals must be received by Friday, June 4, 2004, 4:30 p.m. Eastern, to be considered.  Submittals should be limited to no more than 15 pages, double-spaced, 1” margins using Times New Roman 12-point type.  Exceptions to the 15-page limitation are documentation regarding factor 2 under “Financial Stability.”  Submission may be in either hard-copy format or on compact disk in PDF format.  Submission must be received at the address indicated below no later than 4:30 p.m. Eastern time, on TBD, 2004.  Proposals hand-carried or delivered by commercial couriers must arrive at NASA’s shipping and receiving, rear of the building, at the street address below. NASA will use submissions only for evaluation purposes under this announcement.  All proprietary information must be clearly marked in the proposals.   Submit proposals to Debbie Rivera, Code PM, NASA Headquarters, 300 E Street, SW, Washington, DC 20546.   This request is not to be construed as a commitment by NASA, nor will NASA pay for the information solicited.	Respondents will be sent an acknowledgement of the receipt of their materials.  Any questions regarding this request should be directed to the identified point of contact.

<DESC>DESC: The U.S. Army Research Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM) in Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, is conducting a worldwide market survey for technical information for chemical agent detection kits with capabilities similar to the U.S. M256A1 C hemical Agent Detector Kit. The selected detection kits will be used for testing against the M256A1 Kits requirements. The current M256A1 Kit is a portable, expendable item capable of detecting and identifying low hazardous concentrations of chemical agent s: Blister, Blood, and Nerve.  In addition, the M256A1 Kit operating temperatures is between minus 32 degrees C and 49 degrees C.  The producer of the M256A1 Kits Blister Spot filter paper will discontinue producing the paper in the future. The U.S. Army I ntegrated Product Team recommended that the selected detection kits should be evaluated to help resolve this issue without affecting the readiness of the troops.  In order to prevent future readiness issues, the Army would like to pursue all available opti ons. Evaluating the kits that are similar to the M256A1 kit is an excellent option to resolve this issue. At this point the team is considering evaluating the following five detection kits: Detector Kit Chemical Agent Residual Vapor No. 1 Mk.1 (RVD), R.A.C ./83 Chemical Agent Detection Kit, Chemical Detection Kit (CDK), Semi-Automatic Chemical Agent Detector (SCAD), DETEHIT. It is anticipated that the testing effort and evaluation will take about 3 months. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only. No solicitation document exists.  All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to th is request for information.  Responses may be sent via email to minh.nguyen@us.army.mil, or khoa.nguyen@us.army.mil, Kyle.phillips5@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), 200 L Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20036.  The purpose of this procurement is to conduct analyses of HEDIS data investigating gender differences in quality of care (prevention and treatment) related to cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, as measured through HEDIS performance measures in a national sample of managed care plans. This information will be used to inform the development of recommendations for improving quality of care and eliminating gender differences in cardiovascular care.  The estimated period of performance is 12 months with one 2 year option period.  NCQA is a private, not-for-profit organization dedicated to improving health care quality everywhere.  NCQA is the premier source for information about the quality of the nation's managed care plans using HEDIS.  Since 1990, NCQA has assessed and reported on the quality of the nation's managed care plans.  The information provided by NCQA is designed to help consumers and employers make more informed decisions about their health care.  NCQA evaluates health care quality in three different ways: 1) Accreditation - an on-site review of key clinical and administrative processes; participation in NCQA's accreditation and certification programs is voluntary, but more than half of the nation's HMOs currently participate, striving to attain an NCQA seal of approval;  2) HEDIS - a tool used to measure performance in key areas like immunization and mammography screening rates;  almost 90% of all health plans measure their performance using HEDIS; 3) A comprehensive member satisfaction survey.   Interested parties should fax a written request to the Contracting Officer at 301-427-1740 no later than 5:00pm on May 6, 2004.  All responses will be considered by AHRQ.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>N68335-04-RFI-0094 The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development of a procurement strategy to procure Environmental Control Units (ECU’s) to be installed in Mobile Facilities.  The Mobile Facility is a mobile habitable shelter that is 8 feet wide by twenty feet long by 8 feet high.  The ECU is a heat pump that provides heating or cooling to maintain the Mobile Facility at a suitable temperature for the inhabitants and the equipment installed in the shelter.  Operationally Mobile facilities (MF’s) are setup in a complex in an austere expeditionary environment.  The ECU will take standard 60hz utility power from either a plant grid or Mobile Electric Power Plant (MEP), a diesel engine driven generator set.  The ECU will provide 36,000 BTU/HR of cooling, and 77,000 BTU/HR of heating.  We intend to procure two (2) First Article Test (FAT) unit for functional testing by the contractor and government.  Delivery is required within 90 Days After Contract (DAC). The evaluation will last for a period of 60 days. Upon successful completion of functional testing we intend to exercise an option for the first production year, and place orders.  Another four option years will be available to place orders beyond that, with an estimated maximum order quantity of 800 each.  Delivery shall be 120 After Receipt of Order (ARO).  The ECU shall meet the following requirements.  The ECU shall accept the following input power 208 Volts AC, 3 Phase, 3 Wire with ground at 50 and 60hz.  A total of 75 Amps is available through two connections, one 30 Amp and one 45 Amp connection.  The ECU operating as an air conditioner shall produce a minimum of 36,000 BTU/HR of cooling at 120 F.  The ECU operating as a heat pump shall produce a minimum of 36,000 BTU/HR of heating at 45 F.  The ECU shall provide an additional 41,000 BTU/HR of supplementary heating beyond the capacity of the heat pump.  The ECU shall have the capability to provide conditioned fresh air (outside air) to the supply air stream without loss of heating or cooling performance.  The supply fan of the ECU shall have the capability of operating in ventilation mode, which shall be independent of the cooling or heating cycle, and shall give the ability to select either fresh and/or recirculated air in this mode of operation.  The ECU shall have features to protect the unit/system from damage due to over/under voltage, over/under current, over/under pressure, over temperature.  The ECU shall use a low pressure, unblended, non-ozone depleting working fluid.  The maximum pressure of the working fluid during any phase of ECU operation shall not exceed 400 PSIG.  The ECU shall be Energy efficient.  The ECU shall be installed into a Mobile Facility (MF).  The ECU shall be subjected to the stresses of transportation by ship, truck, and internal airlift.  The ECU shall also be operated aboard ship, or in an expeditionary environment.  The ECU shall be able to function safely, and reliably after being subject to altitude, temperature, shock, vibration, humidity, and salt fog associated with the forms of transport listed above.  The ECU shall operate safely, and reliably when subjected in the shipboard and expeditionary environment.  The electromagnetic interference emitted by the ECU shall not degrade other equipment operating nearby.  The ECU shall not be susceptible to the electromagnetic interference of nearby equipment.  The Contractor shall provide an Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) strategy to maintain the ECU based on its operating environment.  It is anticipated that this model will be in service in the fleet, and be procured as needed over a twenty-year lifespan; therefore the supporting technical documentation is a critical part of this project.  The ECU will be operated in an expeditionary environment.  It will be operated at the Intermediate level (I-level) and will be subject to the environmental conditions identified above.  The ECU can be maintained and calibrated at the I-level maintenance activities.  The I-level can fault locate, remove and replace faulty assemblies and sub-assemblies and calibrate.  Depot level (D-level) maintenance will include all repairs beyond the capability of the I-level.  The Contractor shall deliver a data package suitable to procure this unit in the future without resorting to additional product design effort, additional design and/or manufacturing data or recourse to reverse engineering.  The Contractor shall deliver a Maintenance Plan and Spare Parts List based on the Integrated Logistics Strategy.  The Maintenance Plan shall identify anticipated scheduled and unscheduled maintenance actions for the various components, and subassemblies of the ECU, and the level at which the maintenance actions will be performed, Intermediate or Depot.  Spares support may be procured as a part of this contract.   Under this line item the contractor shall be responsible to either maintain stock, or establish agreements with other suppliers, to provide spares as required be delivered to the fleet within 96 hours.  This agreement is for a level of service with a defined turnaround time, not a specific quantity of parts.  The contractor shall submit as part of their quote a year-by-year quote for this option, as a firm fixed price.  The government may exercise this option, for spare parts support; on a yearly basis for a period of ten years.  The contractor shall determine if calibration procedures are required.  If calibration procedures are required they shall be developed consistent with the ILS strategy.  The Contractor shall deliver a technical manual consistent with the ILS strategy and provide appropriate maintenance instructions with illustrated parts breakdown (IPB) and identify the disposition of parts.  The contractor shall identify training requirements for operation and maintenance, and develop training materials consistent with the ILS strategy. 
We desire that the ECU should weigh no more than 500 lbs, have controls that are easy to access and use, should achieve a low total cost of ownership, consisting of procurement costs and life cycle costs, have a demonstrated record of reliability, be easily maintained, and be corrosion resistant.  We strongly recommend quick disconnect fitting to facilitate servicing and replacement of major components, access panels to facilitate servicing and replacement of major components, liquid charge capability, digital thermostat, and extended warranty covering parts, and depot level service.  Information such as catalogs, sketches, is invited.  This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.202 (e), responses to this notice are not an offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<CONTACT>Cheryl Miles, 301-619-7148
<DESC>Reference-Number-USAARL-04-HEARING.  POC:  William A. Ahroon, Principal Investigator, e-mail:  william.ahroon@us.army.mil.  This is a Market Survey in support of the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL).  The USAARL is conducting a revi ew of hearing protection technologies in order to define acceptable performance requirements for use Army warfighters.  Concepts and technologies identified through this survey will be considered for incorporation into subsequent research testing programs.   Results of these tests will be used to define biomedically-based performance standards for hearing protection and communication.  U.S. Army soldiers are required to operate in many different noise environments.  Some of these environments are predictable  (e.g., tactical vehicles) while others are unpredictable (e.g., explosive events).  Pre- and post-combat activities may involve transportation in a noisy tactical vehicle to and from the site of action.  During combat, the warfighter is exposed to high le vels of impulse noise from friendly and opposing forces weapons systems.  Exposure to high levels of continuous noise from tactical vehicles or high peak levels of impulsive noise from weapons systems has immediate consequences on the unprotected auditory system.  Soldiers can expect significant changes in hearing as the result of these exposures.  While the immediate loss of hearing sensitivity may be temporary and eventually recover to pre-exposure levels, the temporary hearing loss imposes an immediate t hreat to the operational effectiveness of the Soldier.  The USAARL is seeking information on innovative concepts for improving hearing protection and communication for the mounted and dismounted warfighter with the following characteristics:  1) hearing pr otection from steady-state noises typical in tactical vehicles (e.g., M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, UH-60 Black Hawk Helicopter) (which may be supplemented by double hearing protection strategies); 2) hearing protection from high-level impulse noise gener ated by weapons systems and explosive devices; 3) maintenance of situational awareness including the ability to accurately localize sound in azimuth and elevation; 4) ability to maintain face-to-face and radio communications during low- and high-intensity operations; 5) compatibility with military headgear; 6) compatibility with warfighting activities; 7) low power requirements; and 8) low maintenance and long service life.  Interested sources should electronically submit literature/brochures describing the ir concepts using MS Word-, MS Excel-, and MS PowerPoint-compatible formats to William Ahroon, e-mail address william.ahroon@us.army.mil, NLT 30 days after the posted date.  POC for this action is William Ahroon, Principal Investigator, telephone number (3 34) 255-6828.  This is a market survey requesting information only.  No solicitation will be issued against this notice.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  Respondents should submit appropriate  information within 30 days of this publication.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.  Telephone requests are not acceptable.

<ARCHDATE>07062004
<CONTACT>Matthew Ludwig, 732-427-1454
<DESC>The U.S. Army Project Manager Soldier Warrior is conducting a market investigation to identify sources for a ruggedized electronic, noise canceling hearing protection component for possible application to Army warrior platforms.  Warrior platforms in clude mounted and dismounted soldiers with communications equipment that operate in high noise environments.  Audio environments encompass low frequency vehicle machinery noise and spike-type noises such as gunfire and cannon fire.  Electronic hearing prot ection systems must be able to protect the user from the effects of these types of noises, while permitting normal conversation.  Candidate electronic noise canceling systems must be able to operate in a military environment.  This includes rain, water, sa lt atmosphere, sand, mud, dust and temperature extremes.  Vehicle noise levels can reach 115 decibels (dBA).  Identified solutions must be able to reduce machinery noise levels by at least 25dbA across a range of frequencies from 250hz or less to 4Khz and higher, while permitting normal conversation to be heard by the user.  The Government envisions use of a combined microphone and earphone integrated with the noise canceling hearing protection to be used for electronic communications.  Small size, compatib ility for use with helmets, low weight and low power consumption are key performance factors.  The Government intends to identify candidates that are currently in production and then conduct testing of alternatives before any acquisition strategy is finali zed.  This request for information is for planning purposes only; this is not a Request for Quotations or Proposals. No solicitation document exists, and the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of information received. All interested firm s, regardless of size, with candidate products that may meet the desired performance characteristics, are encouraged to respond to this request for information by providing a description of the product with validated data, including model/part number, weig ht, size, power consumption, noise canceling and attenuation performance, and degree of integration with microphone and speaker for communications use. Responses may be sent via email to Darrell Dodds at darrell.dodds@us.army.mil.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued to survey the commercial services market for potential prime contractors/team leaders with an interest in providing advisory and assistance services (including all supervision, labor, incidental materials,  and travel necessary to perform) in support of the U.S. Army Aviation & Missile Command (AMCOM) and its customers.  To take advantage of competitive industry trends in commercial acquisition pricing and service offerings, AMCOM has established the Expedit ed Professional and Engineering Support Services (EXPRESS) Program, a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) program based upon the use of GSA Federal Supply Schedules.  AMCOM desires extensive small business participation within AMCOM EXPRESS.  Therefore, all p otential 8(a), Hubzone, Small Disadvantaged, Woman-Owned, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Veteran Owned, and small business primes/team leaders are strongly encouraged to respond to this RFI. To establish a logical basis for ordering services, AMCOM has defined four (4) domains within EXPRESS:  Technical, Programmatic, Logistics, and Business and Analytical.  Draft Statements of Work (SOWs) for each domain may be found on the AMCOM EXPRESS webs ite located at https://wwwproc.redstone.army.mil/acquisition/omnibus2/.   Respondents may seek consideration in more than one domain by stating an order of preference.  All first preferences will be evaluated.  Subsequent preferences will only be evaluated if adequate competition is not received within the specified domain(s). Each prime/team leader is required to hold at least one of the following GSA schedules:  871-Professional Engineering Services (PES), 874V-Logistics Worldwide (LOGWORLD), 874-Management Organizational and Business Improvement Services (MOBIS), 70-Informati on Technology (IT), or a 00CORP-Consolidated Products and Services Schedule (formerly Corporate Schedule) including appropriate PES, LOGWORLD, MOBIS, or IT Special Item Numbers. Respondents may submit multiple schedules per domain in response to this RFI.  However, a primary schedule that will be used by the prime/team leader to satisfy the preponderance of the domain requirements must be identified. If MOBIS or LOGWORLD is identified as the primary schedule, the NAICS Code and business size standard assigned to the respondents schedule by GSA will apply. If PES is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS 541330 and a size standard of $23M, will apply to the Business & Analytical, Logistics and Programmatic Domains and NAICS 541710 and a size standard of 1,000 employees will apply to the Technical Domain. If IT is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS 541511/541512/541513 and a size standard of $21M will apply to all domains. If the Consolidated Products and Services Schedule is identified as the primary schedule, the primary special item number covered by this schedule (PES, MOBIS, LOGWORLD, or IT) that will be used to satisfy the preponderance of domain requirements must also  be identified.  The NAICS and size standard for the primary special item number, as identified above, will then apply.   The Business and Analytical Domain is reserved for small business primes/team leaders.  At least three awards will be made within the Business and Analytical Domain.  At least one award to an 8(a) prime/team leader and one award to a HubZone prime/team lea der is desired.  If either an 8(a) or a HubZone small business is not selected for one of the first three BPA awards, one or more additional awards may be made to include highly qualified 8(a) or HubZone small business prime/team leaders within the domain. The Logistics Domain is open to both large and small business primes/team leaders; however, the preponderance of BPA awards are reserved for small business primes/team leaders.  At least three awards will be made within the Logistics Domain, with at least two BPAs reserved for small businesses.  At least one award to an 8(a) prim e/team leader is desired.  If an 8(a) small business is not selected for one of the first three BPA awards, an additional award may be made to include a highly qualified 8(a) small business prime/team leader within the domain.   The Programmatic Domain will be open to both large and small business primes/team leaders; however, the preponderance of BPA awards are reserved for small business primes/team leaders.  At least four awards will be made within the Programmatic Domain, with  at least two BPAs reserved for small businesses and one BPA reserved for 8(a) small businesses. The Technical Domain will be open to both large and small business primes/team leaders; however, the preponderance of BPA awards are reserved for small business primes/team leaders.  At least six awards will be made within the Technical Domain, with at lea st three BPAs reserved for small businesses and one BPA reserved for 8(a) small businesses. Each respondents management capabilities, technical capabilities, and pricing structure will be evaluated.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services in accordance with the procedures of FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the solicitation, proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition will be made utilizing the simplified acquisition procedures.  NAICS code is 541360.  This requirement is not set-aside for small business.  The following provisions are incorporated into this notice: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items applies to this solicitation and the successful offeror will be required to provide all necessary certifications, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions and FAR 52.212-5 Contract terms and conditions required by statutes.  

The scope of this project is to collect roughness and GPS data on paved roads in the Forest Highway Network.  Roads are located in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.  Mileage on the network totals 3,057 miles of which 2,255 is in California.  

Roughness data will be collected using a South Dakota type inertial profile measuring device or equivalent built according to ASTM E950 standards.  The profiler must collect the dynamic longitudinal profile of the pavement surface to calculate the pavement IRI roughness index and other indexes such as HRI and PSI according to ASTM E1926-98.  Quarter car simulation will be used to provide IRI data for both the left and right wheel paths.  Calculated roughness indexes need to be averaged and reported using the user defined interval of a tenth of a mile.  GPS must be collected at intervals of no more than 5 seconds and must provide 5 meter accuracy after post-processing.  

A data collection report will be prepared that documents all fieldwork and ride statistics (IRI).  All data, test results, and pertinent information will be provided in a report for each state.  This will include but not be limited to the following: General summary of the designated roadways and field notes about any anomalies that might have influenced the results of the collected data; results of all field investigations including profile test results.  Detailed road log for each route which includes starting and ending coordinates and accounts of any interruption in data collection.  Reports shall include a database of IRI for each road segment in tenth mile increments.  Fields in the database include FH route number, milepost by tenth mile, IRI right wheelpath, IRI left wheelpath, IRI average, and speed of the vehicle.

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(i) Relative Capability to meet the Government requirement.
The Government will evaluate each offeror's relative capability on the basis of the breadth, depth, and relevance of experience to the work that will be required under the prospective contract. The Government prefers experience in:  
1.	Department of Navy Staffing and Recruitment Processes to include STAIRS
2.	Staffing services with an emphasis on hard to fill positions requiring unique professional and engineering skills

(iii) Price.
The Government will make comparisons among the offerors and will select the offer, which represents the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price offeror.

The non-cost evaluation factors (Relative Capability and Past Performance) are significantly more important than price.  However, in making the Government’s best value decision, the importance of price as a factor will increase with the degree of equality in the non-cost factors of offeror’s solicitation responses.  

The Government intends to evaluate offers and a contract WITHOUT discussions with offerors.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to procure on a sole source basis from Washington Group Sales, Falls Church, VA, to disassemble system furniture and move to staging location to be steam cleaned to remove dirt, marks, and stickers.  Washington Group Sales provides labor to disassemble (140) Systems Furniture Workstations and move to location on 2nd Floor of Rockledge 1, Bethesda, MD, for staging agreed by NIH.  Staging location as well as furniture must be clear and accessible prior to disassembly.  Once furniture is staged all work surfaces, pedestals, and overheads will be wiped down and cleared to remove dirt, marks, stickers, etc.  Panels will be steam cleaned on each side.  Furniture will be reinstalled in the same location and layout as when it was disassembled.  All work must be done during normal installation working hours and under normal working conditions.  Changes to layout and work outside installation scope of work must be approved.  Washington Group Sales is the vendor NIH bought furniture from originally, NIH has determined that they are the only company that currently has trained technicians who are familiar with disassembling and reassembling their own system furniture workstations.  Since this needs to be done with a specific layout in mind as well as timeframe, it would be more efficient to use the technicians already familiar with the furniture.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML#40010.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22 dated 4/5/04. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The LHBP has a need to purchase two Lots of the RML custom chips from Affymetrix. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.  RML processes the chips in Frederick, MD (NIAID) which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place at Frederick, MD. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be six(6)weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: (B)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation; 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors  Commercial; FAR52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders  Commercial Items.

At the direction of the National Security Council, Regional Security Office (RSO) Bogota has developed a protection training and advisory program.  This program is funded by NAS and managed by the RSO.  Its purpose is to improve the capabilities of the Government of Colombia (GOC) to protect the Colombian President, Vice President, and Minister of Defense, and the Mayor of Bogotá (capital city of Colombia).  These advisory services and training will be provided in Bogota, Colombia, rather then the traditional U.S.-based protection training because it is more cost effective by allowing for more GOC protection personnel to receive training in a shorter period of time than can be accomplished in the United States.

2.  Position Description: the VIP Protection Training Manager will perform the following basic functions:

A. Coordinate and manage all aspects of the RSO-sponsored and INL-funded VIP protection training program in Colombia.  Ensure the training is conducted in accordance with U.S. law and applicable policies and procedures;

B. Develop, implement, and manage a curriculum of VIP protection training for the protection details of the Colombian senior leadership, to include driving, operations, firearms, and first aid instruction;

C. Ensure that USG-provided commodities and equipment are effectively utilized and that fraud, waste, or mismanagement are prevented through continuous oversight responsibility and end-use monitoring in program operational areas;

D. Evaluate and advise the RSO and NAS continuously on the performance of Colombian agencies receiving NAS/INL assets and resources in order to recommend improvements to the project;

E. Assist in budget preparation and program planning; and

E. Former diplomatic security agent, secret service agent, and/or former Diplomatic Security contractor experience preferred;

F. Experience in Colombia highly desired;

G. Working knowledge of Spanish and ability to communicate with agents, principals, staffs, and others involved in the protection environment; 

H. Experience writing and developing curriculum in VIP protection training courses; and 

I. Physically qualified to live and work in Colombia and to engage in frequent in-country travel to and within remote locations;

4. Required skills/abilities: 

A. Meet Department of State firearms qualification standards;

B. Represent the USG with professional bearing in all meetings and dealings with GOC senior leaders, host-country counterparts, embassy personnel, and all Colombian nationals;

C. Possess experience in writing and developing curriculum for VIP protection training courses, to include execution of training and preparation of VIP protection training lessons.

D. Knowledge of office procedures and report writing;

E. Ability to work with minimum supervision under strenuous and challenging conditions;

F. Computer literacy; must be able to competently use various programs, to include preparing PowerPoint presentations and databases;

B. The NAS Management Officer, American Embassy, Bogota, shall be designated as the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) and is authorized to act for the contracting officer in matters concerning technical clarification, inspection and, after concurrence by the contracting officer, acceptance of contractor’s performance under the contract.

C. In no instance, however, shall the COR be authorized to alter or modify the specifications or the contract terms and conditions or waive the government’s requirement, price, or other terms and conditions, as it is only the contracting officer that can authorize such changes in writing.

6. Guidelines: Guidance is provided from the supervisor in the Regional Security Office and the COR in the NAS Management Office.  Given the operational setting of Colombia, with its internal conflict, constant physical danger and frequently remote sites where the VIP protection program must conduct operations, the ability to demonstrate great originality, resourcefulness and ingenuity is imperative.   

7. Complexity: the VIP Protection Training Manager will advise and assist the RSO and the GOC in all aspects of VIP protection operations. 

8. Scope and effects: assignments or objectives sought may involve extensive analysis and investigation to detect and resolve problems that impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of future VIP protection operations and programs.

9. Personal contacts: contacts are with all levels of host-government personnel, particularly in the offices of the president, vice president, minister of defense, and the mayor of Bogota, and often at the major-to-colonel military ranks.  Contacts at higher levels may be approved with the concurrence of the supervisor.

10. Purpose of contacts: the incumbent serves as the RSO liaison with the offices of the president, vice president, minister of defense, and the mayor of Bogota concerning implementation of the training program, and must often employ persuasion, diplomacy and cooperation to achieve and further USG goals.

Question: Will the 15 systems be installed in one location or distributed?  Do you want one Designer package and 15 production packages? Or Designer and production packages for each of the 15 systems?  Answer: The 15 systems can be delivered to one location; we will bring them to separate locations.

Question:  I understand you need 10,000 cards for each of the 15 systems, right?  Answer:  We need 10,000 cards per system.

Question: Do you want us to quote the plastic cards:  If so, do you want pre-printed cards with some security features or blank white cards?  Answer: We want the blank white plastic cards. 

Question:  Our Company is registered and active in CCR; however we are not on any GSA schedule.  Can we still bid for the job:  Answer:  Yes, you may still bid on the job.

Question:  Is the intention to use the systems in a disconnected fashion (hence the requirement for Access database support) and then periodically synchronize the data from the remote sites into a centralized database:  Answer:  Yes.  Initially there will be no internet access (until installed)

Question:  Is this database currently available:  What is it?  Answer:  Yes.  MS Office XP (MS Access)

Question:  In the amendment, you indicated the “Contractor should send a technical person to the palace with the first shipment to set up and train our people on the use of this system.”  Is this a requirement or a preference?  Answer:  Yes it is a requirement because—we want trained people working on the machines.  Unless there is another way to do this with guaranteed or equal results.  

Question: Please keep in mind that we have a full training facility and training staff about 2-1/2 hours from Washington, DC.  US government personnel have and continue to come here for training before they go overseas.  We also would travel to Washington, DC in order to train your staff.

<DESC>This is amendment #3.  The respose time has been extended to 12:00 EST on April 21, 2004.  Please refer to attachment #1 which has been uploaded to FEDBIZOPS as a seperate JPEG file.
Question:
You have stated that the rear wheel wells need blast protection. Can you confirm that the front wheel wells also need blast protection? If you look at the attachment the Left and Right body tubs attach up on the back side of the front wheel wells plus the under carriage panel will protect against IEDs.  I am not concerned about protecting the engine compartment.
 
Question:
Can you clarify the driveline blast protection?   If you look again at the attachment, the under carriage compartment protects the whole under boby of the vehicle to include the drive line area.  Do you require a vehicle long skid pad to protect the driveshaft??   Again if you look at the attachment the under carrage panel covers the entire under carrage.  
 
Question:
Rear cabin close out: What is the exact meaning of this? If you look at the attachment (at the back of the HMMWV, there are two different types of troop cabin blindes. One is a solid blind (we do not want the solid blind).  We want the three section blind so you can remove the center section to maximize protection and still support the troops in the  back.  We understand it to be the rear panel of the passenger/troop cabin? Is our understanding correct?  YES.
    
Question:
Rear blinders: In the e-mail you stated that these are the side rails along the sides of the HMMWV? Could you be more specific, are they running vertically or horizontally to the ground? Are they just above the rear wheel?  Our HMMWVs have a C-pillar roll system with supporting side rails to complete the roll over protection.  Armor panels cover the side rails down to the top of the wheel wells (running vertical to the ground).
 
Question:
Tubs (right and left): Do these refer to the side panels that cover up the side opening for the rear seats? Or does it mean the actual rear seat compartment itself (where the troop’s feet go)? Looking at the attachment the Left & Right tubs:  From front to back it starts up on the rear side of the front wheel well (covering the driver/passenger lower dash and floorboard area), continues under the troop cabin, up onto the front side of the rear wheel wells (protecting the rear passengers back side).
From outside in:  Protests from the bottom of the doos and under the troop seating area (the under carrage panel covers the drive train area).

<DESC>Amendment 00003:  The solicitation is amended to state the following:  The Contractor does not have to provide DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List as requested initially.      The US Army Special Operations Command, Fort Bragg North Carolina has a requirement to provide a Language Training Program Analysis and Long-Range Surveying Device for the Special Operations Forces Language Office at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials and transportation unless stated in the specifications.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. All quotes shall reference the Request for Quotation number H92239-04-R-0002. Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2001-20. It is the Contractor's responsibility to be familiar with all applicable clauses and provisions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990. The size standard is $6,000,000. This requirement is a total 100% set-aside for small business.  A firm fixed price contract will be issued with a base period and four option periods. A Pre-proposal Conference is scheduled for Thursday, 8 April 2004, 1:00 p.m., HQ USASOC, Bldg E-2929, DCSRM Conference Room 252, Fort Bragg, NC. The contractor shall provide the following:  All personnel and services necessary to conduct the survey program of research analysis of the current Special Operations Forces (SOF) language training programs.  Ensure that SOF personnel receive effective language training to achieve the language skill levels necessary to effectively meet the requirements of their missions.  Design an integrated program which means a program that addresses all needs start to finish to provide SOF personnel effective language training.  This would integrate initial, sustainment, and enhancement training for all flavors of SOF (Army/Navy/AF) and all components (AC/RC).  Currently some SOF receive institutional training in their qualification courses and then sustainment and enhancement training at the unit.  Most SOF get 100% of their training at the unit.  So, the integrated program would take into account all other (non-language) SOF training requirements and propose a solution that is integrated both in terms of initial, sustainment and enhancement language training and in terms of the qualification and at unit training that SOF go through. The contractor shall provide a survey process that will utilize commonly accepted industry methodologies and practices to conduct the survey, which will analyze, but not be limited to, such factors as initial acquisition, sustainment and enhancement language training programs throughout the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  As a minimum, the process will assess available historical data; the relationship between service member Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) and their subsequent language proficiency; instructor qualifications and training materials; instructional methodologies; a longitudinal study of factors effecting skills retention; utility of computer-based and Distributive Learning in language training; and initial acquisition training at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (JFKSWCS).  Results:  This work will create a systemic approach and data to aid in military decision making on the following:  a) best methodology for efficient and cost effective conduct of SOF Foreign Language acquisition and sustainment training, b) best way to select individuals for specific language to be taught, c) metrics required to effectively monitor and adjust training programs.  Note: all assertions/conclusions must be supported.

Projects:  (there may be separate projects, a single project or several-the vendor may determine that certain SOF can be "lumped" together:  Provide empirically based research that documents the effectiveness of existing and new techniques for providing initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training.  The research will analyze the total cost (instructors, materials, overhead, travel, training time, training development, etc.) of initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training used by USSOCOM.   This training is done through military institutions, unit language labs, academic institutions, distributed learning, one-on-one tutoring, and a host of other methods.   This information will then be used to compare results in terms of Defense Language Proficiency Tests (DLPT) scores, training time, DLAB scores and target scores.  All training methods and types considered must be feasible (e.g. very few SOF personnel can or will attend 4 hours of class after their normal duty day to acquire a new language).  We also need recommendations on what metrics are needed and when/where they should be measured.  Specifically, the final product should address the following:  1.What is (are) the most cost effective initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training method(s) or type(s) for RC Army SF?  AC Army SF? AC Navy SOF?  AC Air Force SOF?  RC Army CA?  AC Army CA?  RC Army PSYOP?  AC Army PSYOP?  The contractor shall provide a Statement of Work and a DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List with their proposal.  The contractor shall include their management and technical approach in achieving the objectives; an explanation of the labor mix proposed, as well explain their material and travel line. Standard two (2) page Resumes are required and will be reviewed along with cost proposals.  PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE: The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions are applicable to the acquisition.  Full text clauses and provisions are available at farsite.hill.af.mil.  52.212-1, Instructions to Offers-Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items, with the following evaluation factors inserted in paragraph (a) of the provision: "In order to participate, Contractor shall be required to provide the Government with personnel and services to provide base plus four option years research and analysis surveys of the varied language training efforts conducted within the command.” Quotes shall be evaluated as to compliance with stated requirements.

1. DESCRIPTION.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items under the Test Program at FAR Subpart 13.5 prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) and will follow Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  Responses are requested pursuant to this announcement.  All responses shall reference Solicitation PR 140P0440406.  This solicitation incorporates all of the applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 01-22, as if stated in full text, as well as the terms and conditions of FAR 52-212-1.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) anticipates awarding a firm fixed price purchase order as a result of this solicitation.  This procurement is 100% set aside for small business.  The North American Industrial Classification Code System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 512110.  For this NAICS a small business is not to exceed $25 Million average annual revenues. 2. BACKGROUND.  The Office of Public Affairs (OPA) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has as part of its mission the dissemination of information to the public concerning patents, trademarks, and related information.  The Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified a need for a video explaining the U.S. position on geographical indications (GIs).  The video will be used in all FAS posts, particularly in emerging foreign markets, such as Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, China, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Venezuela. The USPTO has both expertise in trademark matters and experience in producing videos of this general nature and has therefore agreed to produce such a video.  3. PURPOSE.  The purpose of this solicitation and the resultant commercial contract is to establish a source of supply for the production of a video on the U.S. system for protecting geographical indications (GIs) through our trademark system.  The video will be used by FAS posts to explain the U.S. position on GIs and to offer an alternative to reopening the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs).  4. SCOPE OF WORK.  4.1 Under the scope of this requirement the contractor shall provide pre-production and post-production services to create a 15-20 minute video on the U.S. system for protecting GIs through our trademark system.  This color video shall be closed captioned (English) utilizing a script provided by the USPTO.  The video shall be produced in two versions; one each in English (U.S.) and Spanish Latin America.  The above specifications will be reviewed and approved by Richard Maulsby, Director of Public Affairs, USPTO.  4.2 The color video may consist of still photos, stock photos, stock footage, and original footage shot in and around the USPTO, Washington, D.C., and the Metro area.  The contractor shall provide cameras, lighting, and sound to the video, and obtain all necessary stock stills or footage.  The contractor will be responsible for obtaining all releases from any persons on camera, securing any copyright or trademark permissions as needed, and paying any fees as required. 4.3 The contractor will produce a rough-cut with scratch track for review and approval by the USPTO, specifically, Richard Maulsby.  Until such time as the contractor has received written approval, a final video shall not be produced.  Whatever changes necessary to the rough-cut with scratch track will be made by the contractor, with no additional cost the Government, and be resubmitted for approval.  4.4 Upon approval of the final video by the USPTO, the contractor shall provide one Beta SP master and three copies of the video.  The final video shall contain a version in English and a version in Spanish.  The final production shall be placed on CD-ROM or DVD for master for duplication.  4.5 Delivery of the final product is due by July 1, 2004. 5. REQUIREMENTS. 5.1 The contractor must have the appropriate equipment or access to facilities to product the video and create video copies. 5.2 The contractor will be responsible for overseeing and paying any subcontractors needed to fulfill all the requirements of the Statement of Work. 5.3 The contractor should never do work that is not listed in this Statement of Work before contacting USPTO’s Contracting Officer, Brendon J. Johnson, for approval.  He can be reached at (703) 305-8146.  5.4 After completion of the video, the contractor should submit invoices to the USPTO, Office of U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, Office of Finance, Mail Stop 17, P.O. Box 1450, Arlington, VA  22313-1450. 5.5 The USPTO retains all rights to distribution as a Government entity in which no copyright is held.  INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION CRITERIA.  In evaluating responses to this requirement, the USPTO will select the solution that offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  In making this selection, the USPTO is more interested in obtaining quality performance and innovative approaches in the production of stimulating and interesting videos, rather than making an award at the lowest price.  In responding to this announcement respondents shall provide, all pricing information broken down by project/video and associated costs within each project video product, relevant past performance information, references from past performance and successful projects and samples of previous work that demonstrate the following:  1) Use of multi-layered images and graphic techniques.  2) Effective use of music to complement the messages presented. 3) Creative use of wipes, fades and any other creative visual transitions. 4) Professional level lighting and sound quality 5) Highly technical visual representations.  In addition to a completed quotation and technical package, provide your Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, Tax Identification Number (TIN) and a signed Offeror Representation and Certifications as required under FAR 52.212-3.  This solicitation and the resultant award include the clauses cited at FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, and FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration.  Responses/quotes shall be delivered to no later than 2:00 PM on April 29, 2004 to Brendon Johnson, Contracting Officer, Office of Procurement, 2011 Crystal Drive, CPK-1, Suite 810, Arlington, VA  22202.
