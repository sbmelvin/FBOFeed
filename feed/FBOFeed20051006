<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for Item 1: 1 lot of 5 - 4H-SiC epi-wafers; Item 2: 1 lot of 3 - 6H-SiC epi-wafers and Item 3: 5 ea.	4H-SiC wafers. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Cree, Inc., 4600 Silicon Drive Durham, NC 27703. The Sole Source is justified in order to obtain identical SiC epi-wafers needed to complete a series of experiments. The characteristics of epi-wafers differ greatly from one manufacturer to another. Highly critical parameters, such as the dopant profiles at the transitions from one layer to another, vary significantly among epi-wafers fabricated by different manufacturers to the same specifications. This variablility is caused by the differences in the proprietary reactor hardware and growth procedures that are used. The Government intends to acquire commercial items using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m., local time, on October 21, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>1. The Federal Aviation Administration is planning to compete its Enterprise Architecture and Solutions Environment (EASE) requirement.  With regard to planning, the EASE Program Office (PO) seeks comments on the attached draft Screening Information Request (SIR) and Statement of Work.  The draft SIR is without Sections L and M.  Those sections are currently being drafted.  The PO is open for written comment(s) only from the date of this announcement until October 26, 2005.  The PO does not intend to engage in written or verbal discussion with the author of the comment. Comments will merely be considered for use in enhancing the quality of the SIR.  In any event, the PO is not obligated to directly or indirectly respond either in writing or verbally to the author's comment.  Telephone comments or discussions are unacceptable and will not be entertained.  In view of the above discussion, please direct all comments to the following e-mail address:	glenn.a.Wilson@faa.gov 2. Market Survey:	In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the AMS, this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, small businesses (8(a) certified and other small businesses) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information in triplicate from interested vendors: Capability Statement - In view of the scope of the attached draft EASE SOW, this document should describe capability and identify past performance references concerning operation and maintenance of a computing facility of similar size and scope for five years within the past seven years, with an availability rate of 99% percent or better.  (Limited to 5 pages) Resumes - These resumes should be provided for those individuals that are expected to be identified as key personnel in conjunction with the Key Personnel paragraph in the SIR. Expected approach to provide the computing facility, hardware and software components to augment FAA-provided equipment, disaster facilities, and staffing as stated in the SOW. Expected approach to migrate work to the new facility with not more than 72 hours service disruption. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent.  The FAA Acquisition Management System clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations On Subcontracting will apply. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form.  If applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. Attached is the present draft of the statement of work.  The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this effort is 54153 (Size Standard is $21 Million). This market survey is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment, or a promise to contract by the Government.  This market survey does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition. However, the failure of adequate and appropriate 8(a) business or small business participation in this market survey will result in a full and open competition. With regard to this survey, interested respondents must submit information requested by the date and to the point of contact identified in paragraph one above.

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service in Pullman, WA has a requirement for DNA sequencing.  Which includes high though-put sequencing, DNA cloning and protein expression systems.  Amplicon Express has been selected on a sole source basis because they have demonstrated the ability to efficiently make BAC (Bacterial Artificially Chromosome) libraries.

Amplicon is located near our Pullman facility making it possible to process samples from animals without freezing the samples for transport which is required.  Our staff is able to work face to face with the staff of Amplicon Express which minimizes the need for repeat sequencing.  Amplicon Express has provided same day service and the USDA need to retain data consistency.  RFQ's are not available for this requirement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation No. DTRT57-06-Q-80003 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-06.  The NAICS Code is 541511 and the Small Business size standard is $21.0M. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order and to  solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with OAG Worldwide, Inc., Downers Grove, IL, to provide customized subscriptions services described below. The Volpe Center has a requirement for domestic and international airline schedule data as part of the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center’s (Volpe Center) Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) project, in support of the FAA. The ETMS relies on this data to allow the Air Traffic Control System command Center (ATCSCC) to effectively and safely manage the nation’s airports and airspace. Current and accurate flight information is used in ETMS to balance aircraft capacity and demand for airports and airway fixes, and is used by ATCSCC specialists to predict potential traffic problems and to avoid delays by implementing national tra ffic management initiatives. The services required demand that ETMS have continuous and reliable flight schedule data. The Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services to provide the following customized subscription services, (1) WEEKLY BULK DATA TRANSMISSIONS – the Contractor shall provide for a full flight schedule to be made available weekly on a day and time to be coordinated with the Volpe Center.  The range of data shall be for 45 days; (2) WEEKLY FLIGHT RECORD CHANGES – 1. Provide effective and discontinue dates. If there is no effective date available the date reverts to the first day of the delivered data files. If there is no discontinue date the date reverts to the last date of data. There are to be no assumptions. 2. Provide a  carrier code in the carrier code field when there is no match in the FAA carrier code table. This change will give the FAA more flexibility in determining which carriers are missing from the FAA carrier code table. 3. Provide for the deletion of multiple flight records. Since the flight data is primarily a marketing tool, the schedule information contained in the scheduled flight data may reflect a slightly different set of flights from what is actually flown during the applicable time period. 4. Provide all flight leg segments for flights worldwide. 5. Provide all segments of scheduled flight records. There will be times a carrier will fly from a U.S. airport to an international airport with a non-ticket-selling stop at another U.S. airport. The second segment of this flight should be in cluded; (3) AIRCRAFT/CITY T RACKING SYSTEM (ACTS FILES) – The contractor shall provide an updated copy of airlines equipment and airports made during the previous quarter;  (4) DATA TRANSMISSION – The files will be placed in a directory on a host machine, which can be assessed remotely by Volpe Center staff. The Volpe Center will work with the contractor to incorporate any future changes to the current transmission procedures, file structures, and file content. The file structure for the bulk data transmission files shall be: ASCII, Sequential File, 56 characters per line. Proposals shall include pricing for the following items in a written quotation: CLIN 0001 – Quarterly ACTS File (4 EA) _________. CLIN 0002 - Weekly OAG Update – (52 EA) ________. Solicitation provision FAR 52.212-1, Ins truction of Offerors- Commercial Items (JAN 2005) is hereby incorporated by reference; the offer must include a copy of the standard commercial warranty per FAR Clause 52.212-1(b)(5), Terms of any Express Warranty.

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, interior designers, and engineers to modernize our federal buildings and prepare them for the next 50 to 100 years of services.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural-engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals and security requirements and the facility will be designed in metric units.  All projects will be LEED certified.

DESCRIPTION  This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immediately to supp ort Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs. Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative sources. Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in question, we mi ght be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, re-conditioned items, or, in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by suppliers as surplus equipment. Depending upon respondents capabilities and the current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment/repair/overhaul. Alternatively, we might want to buy the unserviceable assets and indu ct these into ongoing organic repair programs that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field. Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY significant quantity of Army a vionics is encouraged to respond with information regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request. Companies capable of performing this effort may respond by writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AN (MICHAEL E. HARRIS), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: EMAIL ADDRESS avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil. This synopsis is for informational purposes only and not an offer for proposal.  For more information, contact Michael E. Harris (732) 532-2453. The deadline for response to this notice is 10 December 2005.

<DESC>The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is seeking proposals from qualified organizations that have the ability to accrue a specified number of study subjects for Phase I clinical trials and clinical pharmacology studies. The main objective of the contract to be awarded as a result of this solicitation is to set up a Phase I Resource Center  (PIRC) to conduct multiple early phase clinical studies with NCCAM-selected botanical dietary supplements. The studies will include some or all of, but are not limited to, the following: dose escalation and tolerability, clinical pharmacokinetics, bioequivalence, and dietary supplement-drug interactions. Phase II efficacy studies will be supported only upon pre-approval by NCCAM. The botanical dietary supplement materials to be studied shall include those developed by dietary supplements manufacturers and individual investigators for NCCAM as well as commercially available in-use botanical dietary supplement materials. NCCAM requires a flexible team of clinicians, statisticians, data managers, and research nurses who have, or have access to, expertise and capabilities to carry out these studies and have access to clinical and research laboratory analyses facilities for botanical dietary supplements. The Contractor must be organized appropriately to attract about 30 study subjects per trial for 1-3 trials per year with a pool of at least 500 potential participants. The study subjects will be mostly healthy volunteers but may also include selected types of patients. NCCAM intends to make one 3-year contract award under this solicitation. Investigators are encouraged to work together and to seek collaborations within and outside their institutions in order to enhance their proposal. Since studies on dietary supplements research may involve multidisciplinary research in multiple organ systems, experience in and capacity to perform such studies will be considered a valuable asset. The North American Industry Classification System (NIACS) code is 541710. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued ELECTRONICALLY approximately December 17, 2004. The RFP will be available on the NCCAM and the Research Contracts Branch (RCB) websites at: http://nccam.nih.gov/research/announcements/active.htm and http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/appl/rfp/published_rfps.jsp.

Sri Lanka Transport Logistics in Tsunami Affected Areas Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Transport Logistics Feasibility Study for tsunami affected areas in Sri Lanka.

The Ministry of Transport is responsible for developing the land transport system for Sri Lanka, rebuilding an efficient and cost effective system, which will enhance the economic competitiveness of the country and improving the quality of life for citizens.  The Ministry of Transport has requested the Study, which will analyze how transportation linkages between Colombo and the southern and eastern areas of Sri Lanka that were devastated by the tsunami can be improved.  The proposed Study would identify each mode’s inherent strengths and weaknesses, and would recommend modal-specific transport and sector-specific measures to improve the sector’s performance and contribution to the region’s economy.  Based on these findings the Study will include an (1) evaluation of the post-tsunami transportation sector in southern and eastern Sri Lanka and a (2) recommendation of projects to improve the overall transport sector in support of regional economic and social development objectives.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $475,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and background materials from the definitional mission are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

However, all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Navy anticipates the award to be a firm fixed price contract. No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Delivery Orders will be issued on a Firm Fixed Price basis for hardware and a T&M basis for support services.  The FBCB2 System is a key component of the Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and interfaces with the Armys Tactical Command and Control System found in Battalion and Brigade TOCs.  The Army has implemented the Modularity Program, which significantly increases the required number of FBCB2 computer systems to be fielded.  The objective of the Armys Modularity Program is to transform the Army force structure, by realigning Division and Brigade units into Units of Action and Employment, which requires more platforms to be equipped with the FBCB2 Syste m. The Government requires additional FBCB2 computer systems, associated spares/accessories and support services for the FBCB2 Systems needed to support the Armys Modularity Program.  The Government does not possess complete technical data for the FBCB2 S ystem. The Government requires computer systems that are form, fit and functionally interchangeable with previously acquired computer systems to ensure operation and installation on the vehicular platforms using the FBCB2 System. The FBCB2 system will conf orm to the specification entitled V-4 Performance Specification FBCB2-V4-0001.  This acquisition will be accomplished by an award on a sole source basis pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source, per J&A  Control Number 05-1010

<DESC>The US Department of Education, via the Institute of Education Science's National Center for Education Research, intends to solicit offerors for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. SBIR is a highly competitive program that encourages small business to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the nation's R&D arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific research and development needs.  Offers will be accepted for the development of products and services that help further the mission of the Department of Education.  Specifically, there will be two priorities for this solicitation:

PRIORITY 1 -- Services

This priority supports research to develop effective business consulting services that can better serve the education community at both the local and state levels. The Institute of Education Sciences SBIR Program invites proposals that seek to develop a plan or a business model for the provision of such services. Examples of relevant services include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.  Education Data Management - There is a need to provide schools, districts and States with more effective data management tools that support their efforts to meet the standards set forth in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). An example would be an proposal or service designed to provide a particular school, a group of schools, or a local district with test results that have been condensed into readable and easily interpretable language for teacher and principal use. This service might also include the development of classroom profiles depicting students' performance and providing recommendations on courses of action to be taken in order to enhance student achievement.

2.  Evidence-Driven Consulting Services - Superintendents, principals and teachers could benefit from technical assistance in applying empirically based studies about a particular content area (e.g., reading, mathematics, science) to the local context.   In addition, schools that are having trouble meeting the requirements of NCLB could benefit from consulting services designed to provide them with a menu of options and strategies they could implement in order to enhance student learning and achievement.

3.  Financial Data Services at the School, District or State Level - These services might include the further development of existing financial software and/or the evaluation of existing commercial software to determine which product best meets the need of the school, district or state systems. Offerors are encouraged to consult the background section of the Education Finance, Leadership, and Management program solicitation for a more detailed description of the limitations the Institute sees in existing financial software. This program solicitation can be accessed at: 
http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ies/programs.html?src=mr 

4.  Technology Consulting Services - These services might focus on assisting schools with the selection and implementation of relevant educational technologies and most importantly, on training teachers and other relevant school personnel on how to make most effective use of these new technologies. 

PRIORITY 2 -- Products
Awards up to $100,000

This priority supports the development of empirically derived educational products in the areas of reading or mathematics or science or character/pro-social development at the pre-kindergarten through post-secondary levels, including products that support teachers and administrators as well as products that are used directly by students. Offerors are encouraged to consult the background section of the individual solicitations for other Institute grant competitions in the topic areas listed above to better understand the thinking behind this priority.  All relevant solicitations can be accessed at: http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ies/programs.html?src=mr. 

Products may include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.	Software Proposals
2.	Supplemental Educational Materials (i.e., workbooks, readers and professional development materials)
3.	Assessment instruments 

The SBIR Program is made up of three phases: Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific or technical merit and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR program, Phase II is to expand on the results of and to further pursue the development of Phase I projects and is the principal research or R&D effort, and Phase III , the small business must use non-SBIR capital to pursue commercial proposals of the research or research and development.  This solicitation will principally be for Phase I.  However, under ED's new Fast-Track program, offerors may apply concurrently for Phase I and Phase II.  Phase I awards may not exceed $100,000 and Phase II awards may not exceed $750,000.  

The opening date is on or around November 4, 2005,  the closing date is January 6, 2006 at 2:00 p.m. EST.  Copies of the solicitation will be available for download on www.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV.  Copies of the solicitation may also be available at http://www.ed.gov/programs/sbir/index.html.

<DESC>1. The Federal Aviation Administration is planning to compete its Enterprise Architecture and Solutions Environment (EASE) requirement.  With regard to planning, the EASE Program Office (PO) seeks comments on the attached draft Screening Information Request (SIR) and Statement of Work.  The draft SIR is without Sections L and M.  Those sections are currently being drafted.  The PO is open for written comment(s) only from the date of this announcement until October 26, 2005.  The PO does not intend to engage in written or verbal discussion with the author of the comment. Comments will merely be considered for use in enhancing the quality of the SIR.  In any event, the PO is not obligated to directly or indirectly respond either in writing or verbally to the author's comment.  Telephone comments or discussions are unacceptable and will not be entertained.  In view of the above discussion, please direct all comments to the following e-mail address:	glenn.a.Wilson@faa.gov 2. Market Survey:	In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the AMS, this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, small businesses (8(a) certified and other small businesses) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information in triplicate from interested vendors: Capability Statement - In view of the scope of the attached draft EASE SOW, this document should describe capability and identify past performance references concerning operation and maintenance of a computing facility of similar size and scope for five years within the past seven years, with an availability rate of 99% percent or better.  (Limited to 5 pages) Resumes - These resumes should be provided for those individuals that are expected to be identified as key personnel in conjunction with the Key Personnel paragraph in the SIR. Expected approach to provide the computing facility, hardware and software components to augment FAA-provided equipment, disaster facilities, and staffing as stated in the SOW. Expected approach to migrate work to the new facility with not more than 72 hours service disruption. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent.  The FAA Acquisition Management System clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations On Subcontracting will apply. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form.  If applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. Attached is the present draft of the statement of work.  The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this effort is 54153 (Size Standard is $21 Million). This market survey is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment, or a promise to contract by the Government.  This market survey does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition. However, the failure of adequate and appropriate 8(a) business or small business participation in this market survey will result in a full and open competition. With regard to this survey, interested respondents must submit information requested by the date and to the point of contact identified in paragraph one above.

SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE – UNITED STATES NAVY (USN) ARMED SECURITY OFFICER SERVICES, CONUS/OCONUS

This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This is a market research tool to determine the availability of sources prior to issuing the RFP.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  An award will not be made on offers received in response to this notice.  If the solicitation is issued, source selection procedures will be utilized, which will require offerors to submit technical experience, past performance and price for evaluation.  The Government is not responsible for the cost associated with any effort expended in responding to this notice.

The intent of this notice is to identify potential Small Businesses (SB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZONE) Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB) certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the provisions of the Section 8(a) program, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), capable of providing armed security services at - various Navy Installations regionally.  The NAICS code for this proposed procurement is 561612 (size standard is $10.5M).  The contract will consist of a base period and options totaling 60 months of performance.  Services/options are anticipated unless precluded by legislative language (Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act; PL 107-314 Sec 332).  There will be a 60-day transition period to full performance at individual installations.  Start-up at the individual installations will be phased-in during the base period.

The successful contractor, to any forthcoming solicitation, shall provide all labor, supervision, management, supplies, equipment, transportation and any other items necessary to perform Security Officer Services at Navy installations, Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS).

<DESC>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.
The Solicitation posted appears to be incomplete.  Specifically:
The cover page states there should be 148+ pages.  There appears to be only 34 pages in the
posted solicitation.  The organization of the solicitation does not follow the outline provided on the cover page.  Portions of the document are missing; for example, Section L starts with L.7 rather than L.1, and Section M seems to be incomplete and was swapped with Section K. 
In Section L, there are no instructions for providing past performance; the cost volume
information is not detailed; and page limitations are not included, etc. Will these sections be made available and if so when?

We originally intended to include Section J; however, Section had to be uploaded separately.  This is the reason for the miscount of the pages.

Item 9 of the cover page does not specify the number of copies of the offer required.  Please specify.
An original and 3 copies.

Item 9 of the cover page does not specify a location for hand-delivery of the offer.  Please specify.

The Adams Building
2nd Street, SE
Room LA 325

Item 9 of the cover page specifies delivery of the bid by 03:00 on 5/02/2005.  Please clarify whether this is a.m. or p.m.

Will there be an extension to the response date granted based upon the corrections to the solicitation?
Not planned at this time.

Section B:

Section B requests a cost for photoduplication.  However, Section C does not specify the requirements for photoduplication. What is being photoduplicated and delivered by the contractor?

formats including:
35mm microfilm
film to paper
original filming
photocopying
cartographic scanning
digital images to CD-ROM
all formats of photographic reproduction
     
Photoduplication is meant for photocopying project related documents in large volume.  It is rarely used.  It might be used, for exam;le, if NLS needed a documentation for the website copied and sent to network libraries.

If there are incumbent contractors, who are they?

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT


PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THE 305th CONTRACTING SQUADRON, pursuant to this BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA), SOLICITS CONCEPT PAPERS IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB.
A. INTRODUCTION:  The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  Our primary focus is on identifying and investigating initiatives capable of being demonstrated in 18 months.  Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), AMB invites solution white papers with rough-order-of-magnitude cost and schedule estimates that address technological innovations and/or process improvements that reduce mobility response times, reduce deployable support structures, increase deployed combat capability and effectiveness, and/or enable USAF members to do their job more efficiently.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Responses shall reference Solicitation Number.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 30 SEP 06, AND WHITE PAPERS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME UP TO THAT DATE.  AMB considers submissions by evaluation of a five page white paper.  A copy of this BAA is also posted on the World Wide Web at http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm. 
B. OBJECTIVE:  Technical Description.  AMB solicits innovative white papers addressing solutions to identified MAF needs.  AMB prefers to use contractor-loaned equipment or to participate in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), but does have limited funding for demonstrations.  Ultimately, the AMB conducts operational demonstrations of innovative mobility concepts, evaluates their military worth, and presents its assessments to senior decision makers including the Commander of the Air Mobility Warfare Center, the Commander of Air Mobility Command, Commander U.S. Transportation Command, and the Chief of Staff of the USAF. 

Within the fields of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support, current high-interest areas include:
 
a.	 Aeromedical evacuation enhancements
b.	 Air base opening capabilities
c.	Aircraft threat mitigation
d.	Autonomous landing capabilities
e.	Enhancing aircrew situational awareness
f.	Collaborative tools to facilitate C2 reach back capabilities
g.	Expeditionary airbase/en route force protection
h.	MAF/CAF interoperability, specifically organizational and process interoperability
i.	NVG-compliant airfield lighting and NVG training
j.	Precision airdrop and airdrop tracking
k.	Real time in transit visibility 
l.	Seamless and secure communication between MAF/CAF aircraft, C2 centers, and ground forces
m.	Tactically-relevant aircrew training devices

AMB solicits white papers with the potential to enhance Air Force operations within any element of air mobility operations or their interfaces with the rest of the Defense Transportation System.  Submitters are encouraged to visit http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm to view a current list of AMB innovation areas.
C. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  Submitters are required to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference the BAA number with their submissions.  Submitters are reminded that they must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov to conduct business with the Government.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply.  Notice to Foreign Owned Firms:  Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Air Force point of contact, Captain Steven Kraabel, USAF AMB/MBP, (609) 754-7938 or e-mail battlelab@mcguire.af.mil upon deciding to respond to this announcement.  Foreign contractors shall be aware that restrictions may apply which could preclude their participation in this announcement.
D. WHITE PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.

The Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, strives to better serve the community in the Pacific Northwest region by reaching out to the community members and informing them of career opportunities.  As an equal employment opportunity agency it is imperative that the community outreach targets all community members including minority ethni c groups.

Washington State is one of the top 10 states that is experiencing the most Latino-Hispanic demographic growth.  It is impo rtant for the Agency to reach out to this minority ethnic group and to develop a brand image through community outreach to ensure that career opportunity information and opportunities are offered to the Latino-Hispanic community to ensure that the Agencys  workforce is diverse and representative of the communities that we serve.   II. PURPOSE - The purpose of this procurement is to contract for the community outreach, marketing communications and branding to help increase its visibility and create a premier image for the Corps of Engineers, Seattle District in the Latino-Hispanic co mmunity. A diversified workforce of cultures enhances the knowledge and teamsmanship of the various project teams for the Agency.

This session shall be summarized by the contractor and the conclusions of the meeting provided in a written summary document for review and approval before beginning development of the concepts. Following this meeting, the Agency will pr ovide the contractor a packet of all current Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, outreach material for their review.  (2)	The contractor shall be responsible for taking this shared vision for the Agency and developing a set of two concepts for Agencys staff to review. The concepts shall include preliminary designs and general outreach material layouts in Bilingual Spanis h-English language that represent the Agency in a manner fitting the shared vision. Once senior staff has approved the  concepts, the Agency will have the opportunity to internally review the concepts with the Agencys employees and request any minor changes to be made until the items are satisfactory to Agency.  The contractor will also develop and present a community out reach strategy including the dates and events of local Hispanic-Latino events around the Pacific Northwest region, an overview of each event and the strategy for each event.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Navy to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a requirement for upgrading of the Automatic Radar Periscope Detection and Discrimination (ARPDD) engineering test asset (a.k.a. ARPDD Brassboard system) with hardware capable of supporting an upgraded version of a Government developed discriminator software.  This engineering asset requires hardware and software modifications to accommodate communication and processing ‘through puts’ for proper functioning of the discriminator software.   
Additionally required are radar technology risk reduction developments that address identified risks from a Government Technology Readiness Assessment for ASW radar’s with ARPDD capabilities.  Required risk reduction developments in this area include development of a digital wideband receiver for an APS-137 radar, an upgraded automatic detector for a proposed ARPDD mode, development of an integrated high-speed processing system for the discriminator subsystem. Integration of these developments into the ARPDD Brassboard system and test of all of these components including the Government’s discriminator software.  The modifications should be carried out using an open system architecture for hardware and software that supports future system growth.  The contractor should maximize the use of commercial off the shelf technologies and select such technologies so that obsolescence is minimized.
Minimal documentation exists for the developed Brassboard system and software discriminator.  No level III engineering drawings or documents are owned by the Government for the Brassboard system that includes the APS-137 and discriminator subsystems.  All work is required to be performed in a classified setting and meet all Government security requirements for data items and hardware identified as SECRET.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego (FISCSD) is seeking commercial sources capable of providing television and high-speed Internet services to Navy and Marine Corps (N/MC) locations within the San Diego metropolitan area. The FISCSD intends to award one or more ten-year Franchise Agreements and follow-on annual contracts to procure the required Cable television services. The level of services expected for the life of the Franchise Agreement(s) will be comparable to services available to the public and surrounding communities. BACKGROUND: Currently, the Government is receiving cable service under a franchise agreement with Americable serving approximately 6,000 total subscribers that is set to expire 8 October 2006. The current customer base is comprised of: .	Centrally funded Navy organizations on Bases .	Private Navy personnel on-Base residential accounts. The existing cable service provides an estimated 60 basic channels, 10 premium channels and government channels. The Navy and Marine Corps seek a cost-effective commercial solution for the installation and servicing of cable television and related unofficial services. The proposed system/services can be provided via any medium (i.e., cable, satellite, etc.), depending on the contractor's best technical solution for satisfying the requirements. Satellite services do not require a Franchise Agreement, so award to a satellite service provider will proceed directly to the contracting phase.

<SUBJECT>K -- Modification of Equipment
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Acquisitions Management and Operations Branch (AMOB) has a sole source requirement for the modification of imaging equipment to be installed at the Integrated Research Facility (IRF) in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  The Imaging Core in the IRF’s BSL-4 facility will contain four modalities:  MRI, PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and X-Ray.  The imaging equipment must be isolated from the imaging specimen to prevent contamination of the system and eliminate the possibility of infecting non-protected personnel with experimental agents.  The NIAID intends to award a two year contract to Philips Medical Systems (PMS) on a sole source basis, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, beginning on or about November 18, 2005, for the modification and installation of the four imaging modalities.  PMS was the only responsible offeror to previously announced NIAID competitive requirements during Phase I of the development program, under which the company provided the four off-the-shelve equipment modalities of PMS brand, conducted feasibility studies and develop concepts and specifications for the modification and installation of the four imaging modalities to meet the NIAID requirements.  The sole source contract hereby announced is for PMS to perform the modifications to the imaging instruments, and for the installation, test and validation of the equipment at the IRF’s BSL-4 facility.  The resources and additional time that would be required for another firm to develop the concept and specifications for modification and installation of the four imaging modalities would be prohibitive to the NIAID and endanger the efficient continuation of several of its research programs.  For these reasons the NIAID believes that no other offeror can fulfill the existing needs for the modification of the imaging equipment for its BSL-4 facility.  Please refer any questions in writing to Ivan Hernandez at Ihernandez@niaid.nih.gov on or before November 18, 2005, at 2:00pm.

<SUBJECT>--Portable Radio Test Set
<DESC>The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, Product Manager for the Test Equipment Modernization Program (PM-TEMOD) is responsible for the acquisition of the state-of-the-art, commercial/non-developmental general purpose test equipment. The new equip ment will be used to standardize the inventory and replace existing obsolete test equipment.      A post Joint Working Group (JWG) revised draft purchase description/specification has been developed for the portable radio test set.  The Test Set, Radio: AN /PRM-35 is a commercial off the shelf (COTS), non-developmental item (NDI).  The Test Set, Radio: AN/PRM-35 shall be a lightweight (less than 25 lbs) test set required to test the Receiver  Transmitter part of the radio and the family of SINCGARS radios a t the field or organizational level.  SINCGARS is a family of VHF-FM combat net radios which provides the primary means of command and control for Infantry, Armor, and Artillery units.  The SINCGARS system is designed on a modular basis to achieve maximum commonality among the various ground and airborne system configurations.  A common Receiver-transmitter (RT) is used in the man pack and all vehicular configurations.            The SINCGARS family of radios has the capability to transmit and receive voice, tactical data, and record traffic messages and is consistent with NATO interoperability requirements.   The system operates on any of the 2320 channels between 30-88 Me gahertz and is designed to survive in a nuclear environment.  SINCGARS operates in a hostile environment through use of electronic counter-counter measure (ECCM).  Communications Security (COMSEC) is integrated within the radio.          The test set shall be portable and provide the user the capability to perform Antenna Insertion Loss, Return Loss, Distance to Fault, Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR), Field Strength, Sweep Frequency, Power, and Sensitivity measurements over a fr equency range threshold of 30.0 MHz to 1 GHz (objective of 3.0 GHz).  The test set will have Antenna, Audio, and Microphone/Headset connectors. The objective of the radio test set is to be software and/or hardware upgradeable to the JTRS 2 GHz frequency ra nge, Universal Serial Bus (USB), Recommended Standard (RS) 232, Ethernet, Graphic User Interface, Windows CE (Common Embedded) and keyboard jack capability.  The radio test set shall be powered by a five-hour lithium-ion battery with an Alternate (AC) and/ or Direct Current (DC) charger adapter.        There are six (6) typical tests that are performed on the Receiver-Transmitters. Two of the tests check the receiving section of a receiver-transmitter. These tests check the receiver sensitivity (ability to r eceive weak signals) and the 150 Hz tone squelch circuits. Both tests are performed with the MODE switch in the SENSITIVITY SQUELCH position. The other four tests measure the forward power, reverse (reflected) power, frequency, and relative radiated field strength of the transmitting section of a receiver-transmitter. These four tests are performed with the MODE switch in the FORWARD POWER, REVERSE POWER, FREQUENCY, and FIELD STRENGTH positions, respectively.   a.	Receiver Tests: To test the receiver, the test set outputs a spectrum of frequencies from 30 to 80 MHz spaced 5 MHz apart. This spectrum is modulated with 150 Hz and 900 Hz tones. An example of a typical SENSITIVITY SQUELCH test is to connect the output  of the test set to the antenna connector of the receiver under test. By putting the receiver in an unsquelched mode and setting the frequency of the receiver to 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 and 80 MHz, the -97 dBm level of the spectrum should pr oduce noticeable quieting in the HANDSET and the 900 Hz tone should be heard. The squelch circuits are tested by placing the receiver in a squelched mode and setting the frequency of the receiver to 75 MHz. At that frequency the deviation due to the 150 Hz  modulation in the test set output spectrum is sufficient  to disable the receiver squelch circuits. The test set only outputs the spectrum when the test is required.  b.	Transmitter Tests: To test a typical transmitter, the test set inputs an RF signal from the transmitter under test. Each of the four transmitter tests( FORWARD POWER, REVERSE POWER, FREQUENCY AND FIELD STRENGTH)  measures a different parameter of the RF  transmit signal. In the forward power, reverse power and frequency test the RF signal from transmitter under test is input to the radio test set connector. A 50- ohm load is connected to the ANTENNA connector to terminate the signal. During the FIELD STRE NGTH test, no connection is made to either connector. FIELD STRENGTH is measured through the FIELD STRENGTH ANTENNA (field strength antenna). 1.	Forward Power Test. The forward power test is used to test the forward power of the RF output signal from a transmitter or receiver-transmitter and is measured in a range of 0 to 50 watts.   2.	Sensitivity Squelch Test.  The sensitivity squelch is used to test the sensitivity and squelch circuits of a receiver or receiver-transmitter. 3.	 Reverse Power Test. Reverse (reflected) power is used to test the impedance mismatch. 4.	Frequency Test. Frequency is used to measure the frequency of the RF output signal from a transmitter or receiver-transmitter. 5.	Field Strength. Field Strength is used to measure the field strength of the RF output signal from a transmitter or receiver-transmitter.  The above objectives and thresholds are results of issues from the JWG in Aug 05.  Interested manufacturers are encouraged to review and provide comments/questions concerning the above performance objectives and thresholds for the Radio Test Set.  Your res ponse will assist the Government in defining the final purchase description/specification that will be sent out with the formal letter request for bid samples. The Test Set, Radio: AN/PRM-35 program has a projected Army requirement of a minimum quantity of 15 to 12,000 units based upon availability of funding.  No decision has been made at this time as to the type of procurement, i.e., full and open competition v ersus small business set-aside. Point of contact is Vern Spearman, PM-TEMOD, (256)313-2939, e-mail Vern.Spearman@redstone.army.mil, FAX (256)313-2940.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

**************************************************************************************************************
Statement of Work
Training Coordinator Boston, MA
1. Objective and Scope
The objective of this effort is to effectively coordinate the planning and conduct an evaluation of personnel training within the Defense Contract Management Information Technology Customer Service Organization (ITCSO) user community. The Service Provider (SP) will provide technical advice and assistance to all levels of management regarding information technology training. The SP will also have the additional responsibility for scheduling and tracking training opportunities for each Information Technology employee. This position is located in Boston, Massachusetts.
2. About DCMA
The Defense Contract Management Agency is the Department of Defense (DoD) agency responsible for working with the Defense industry to help ensure that systems, supplies and services are delivered on time, at projected costs and meet performance requirements. This involves managing 320,000 prime contracts with current work valued at $850 billion.
DCMA is headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia (with a mailing address of Alexandria, VA), and employs over 11,000 civilian and military professionals worldwide.   The agency is organized into three Districts:  East, headquartered in Boston, MA; West, headquartered in Carson, CA; and International, which is co-located with the agency headquarters.  The districts are further subdivided into 60 Contract Management Offices (CMOs) that work with Defense industry contractors at over 900 locations worldwide.
3. Work to be performed
Task 1 – Conduct pre-training coordination and planning
The SP shall work with DCMA ITCSO personnel to identify training needs and schedule corresponding training to make the most of the training resources and minimize service disruptions.  The number of ITCSO personnel supported by organization is 306 government.
These personnel are geographically dispersed across the United States with a small percentage of individuals locate overseas.  Communications with ITCSO personnel will be through email and phone.
This effort includes:
Reviewing IDPs of ITCSO personnel
Attending training as required to keep abreast of new technical training programs for the ITCSO workforce
Developing and maintaining ITCSO training plans
Scheduling group or individual training sessions
Meeting with management to review and revise training budgets
Maintaining credit statements for training payments
Submitting conference requirements for offsite training
Serving as the Executive Directorate’s liaison for ITCSO training matters and HQs programs
Task 2 – Maintaining Training Records
The SP shall maintain training records of all Information Technology personnel training completions.  Records include lists of courses completed, training certifications, and individual development plans.  The records will be maintained in the DCMA Learning Management System or other designated electronic system.

4.	Performance Expectations and Standards:
Maintain ITCSO Senior Management Customer Satisfaction:
ITCSO Senior Management customer satisfaction will consistently equal or exceed “satisfactory.”
Effectively schedule and coordinate training.
Execute 95% of the FY training plan. 
Maintain accurate records.
Maintain 95% accuracy of training records of all Information Technology personnel training completions.
5.  Periodic Adjustments of Performance Standards:
In its experience with other performance-based instruments, DCMA has found it not only advisable but necessary to adjust performance standards periodically.  That is because particular written expressions of performance standards sometime inadvertently motivate services provider behaviors that act against achievement of the desired performance objectives.  Having learned that lesson, DCMA intends to apply it to this PBSO.  Accordingly, DCMA reserves the right to adjust any or all performance standards in this PBSO, up to and including the addition of entirely new performance standards and complete substitutions of new performance standards for those already existing in this PBSO or as may have been included by subsequent modifications of this document, at any time at the DCMA Information Technology Customer Service Organization’s (ITCSO’s) discretion—subject, of course, to the stipulations in the “Changes” clause of any resulting contract.  DCMA, however, does not plan to make any such adjustments more often than once each calendar quarter and in fact would prefer not to make them any more frequently than once each calendar year.       
6. Period of Performance
The period of performance shall be one year after contract award with 4 option years. 
7.  Place of Performance
The place of performance shall be Government facilities at DCMAE, 495 Summer Street, Boston, MA 02011.
8. Other Direct Costs
Other direct costs (ODCs) must be approved by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) prior to purchase by the contractor. All required ODCs approved by the DCMA representative will be on a cost reimbursement basis to include the contractor's appropriate overhead and may only be purchased if funding is available on the contract.
9. Travel 
This is a travel inclusive rate. The expectation is that the contractor shall travel to a major city in the US once a month for three days to monitor training or attend conferences.
10. Security
Access to classified data will not be required for this project.  However, contractor personnel assigned to this contract will perform in an ADP II designated sensitive position due to the nature of the work performed.  Assignment to an ADP II position requires favorable adjudication of a National Agency Check request with Inquiry.  The contractor will provide sufficient documentation through their Security Office to the Defense Contract Management Agency Security Office to show favorable adjudication of required investigations.
