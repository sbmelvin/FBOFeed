<DESC>The United States General Services Administration, Northwest/Arctic Region, Public Buildings Service, Acquisition Division, Construction Acquisitions Branch intends to add logical followon<br />work to VetFed-Pacific Tech JV 1under their existing Task Order GS-P-10-16-LT-7065 that was issued competitively against Contact GS-10P-14-LT-D-0036. The work is to add a security fence around four existing parking stalls and associated work at the GSA owned parking lot adjacent to the Tacoma Union Station Federal Courthouse in Tacoma, Washington 98402.
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is codified under 48 C.F.R. 31. FAR Subsection 16.505 (b)(2)(i)(C)) allows for the Government to award work on a sole source basis to existing contractor on the basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical followon<br />to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.</p>
<p>VetFed-Pacific Tech JV 1 (hereafter called VetFed) was awarded design-build construction task order GS-10P-14-LT-D-0036/ GS-P-10-16-LT-7065 for tenant improvements to construct a command center within the GSA leased Tacoma Union Station Federal Courthouse at the 1701 Pacific Ave, Tacoma, Washington under the existing competitively awarded Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside Western Service Centers (WSC) Design-Build Construction Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (WSC Design-Build Construction IDIQ MATOCs) (GS-10P-14-LT-D-0034 (Burton Construction, Inc), GS-10P-14-LT-D-0035 (Macnak Construction LLC), GS-10P-14-LT-D-0036 (VetFed-Pacific Tech JV 1), and GS-10P-14-LT-D-0037 (Ronsons SDVOSB P&amp;L JV-1) pursuant to FAR 16.505. All Western Service Center WSC Design-Build Construction IDIQ MATOCs awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original task order and the work being added falls within the overall scope of the WSC Design-Build Construction IDIQ MATOCs and need to be solicited.</p>
<p>It is the GSA's position that incorporating this work under the existing task order with VetFed will result in economies of scale, with both cost and time reductions as the GSA will be able to add the work to an exist task order instead of soliciting the work under a separate procurement.</p>
<p>The work is logical follow-on site repair work that will provide both economy and efficiency to the Government. VetFed will self-perform a majority of the work themselves and has equipment and manpower available to complete the work at the Tacoma Union Station Federal Courthouse and associated parking lot as they will be performing work within the next few weeks as part of the existing project. The work will be able to be performed concurrently with the existing period of performance and with anticipated cost savings realized. VetFed will be able to perform without loss of efficiency and economy. Use of another company would lead to unacceptable delays though some duplication of effort and greater costs for both management and supervision, mobilization/ demobilization, extra time for soliciting and awarding a task order, as well as costs if the work is being subcontracted by a different MATOC holder. <br />Specific detail for the exception to fair opportunity are included in the attached approved justification.<br />Comments can be sent to the Contracting Officer.</p>
