<p>USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM - STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) INFORMATION IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</p>
<p>(APR 2014)</p>
<p>(a) General.</p>
<p>(1) Past performance is an indicator of a Contractor's ability to perform satisfactorily on future awards.</p>
<p>(2) When used in best value source selections, past performance information will be evaluated based upon the currency and relevancy of past performance information in order to reach a confidence assessment for each offeror from which offers were received.</p>
<p>(3) The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will evaluate offerors' past performance, which may include, but is not limited to, their record of conforming to specifications, conformance to the standards of good workmanship, adherence to contract schedules, and commitment to customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>(b) Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services may, be used in evaluating contractor past performance.</p>
<p>(c) PPIRS-SR classifications are established for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/. Contractors are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and rating methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR procedures manual and the PPIRS-SR user guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.</p>
<p>(1) PPIRS-SR classifications. Specific information as to how PPIRS-SR determines delivery and quality classifications can be found in the PPIRS Reference Material, specifically the "PPIRS-SR Evaluation Criteria" document on the PPIRS-SR Website at http://www.ppirs.gov/ppirsfiles/reference.htm.</p>
<p>(2) Classifications are calculated based upon three years of data.</p>
<p>(3) Data sources for PPIRS-SR information can be found in the PPIRS Reference Material, "PPIRS-SR Evaluation Criteria" document on the PPIRS-SR Website at http://www.ppirs.gov/ppirsfiles/reference.htm.</p>
<p>(4) PPIRS-SR will make negative quality and delivery data reflected in the PPIRS-SR Classification available to contractors for review and challenge. This is accomplished within the PPIRS-SR system.</p>
<p>(d) The following procedures will be followed when the Contracting Officer evaluates PPIRS-SR classifications:</p>
<p>(1) The Contracting Officer may consider the volume of business on which the classification is based as a measure of confidence in the classification as an indication of performance risk.</p>
<p>(2) Specifics as to how PPIRS-SR calculations are affected when there is no delivery or quality information provided by the source data bases can be found in the PPIRS Reference Material, specifically the "PPIRS-SR Evaluation Criteria" document on the PPIRS-SR Website at http://www.ppirs.gov/ppirsfiles/reference.htm.</p>
<p>(3) In the case of a Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available in the PPIRS-SR, the Contractor will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(4) Contractor-caused discrepancies or delinquencies will be reflected in a contractor's past performance assessment. Repair, replacement or reimbursement of quality and packaging defects will not provide relief of negative DLA performance data. Contractor-caused delivery extensions, regardless of consideration paid, will be reflected in the delivery classification for contracts issued by DLA.</p>
<p>(e) The Contracting Officer may collect and analyze other relevant information in addition to any past performance information derived from PPIRS-SR.</p>

<p>(2) Specifics as to how PPIRS-SR calculations are affected when there is no delivery or quality information provided by the source data bases can be found in the PPIRS Reference Material, specifically the "PPIRS-SR Evaluation Criteria" document on the PPIRS-SR Website at http://www.ppirs.gov/ppirsfiles/reference.htm.</p>
<p>(3) In the case of a Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available in the PPIRS-SR, the Contractor will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(4) Contractor-caused discrepancies or delinquencies will be reflected in a contractor's past performance assessment. Repair, replacement or reimbursement of quality and packaging defects will not provide relief of negative DLA performance data. Contractor-caused delivery extensions, regardless of consideration paid, will be reflected in the delivery classification for contracts issued by DLA.</p>
<p>(e) The Contracting Officer may collect and analyze other relevant information in addition to any past performance information derived from PPIRS-SR.</p>

SELECTION CRITERIA

Firms responding to this synopsis will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firms to perform the required services in accordance with the selection criteria contained in this synopsis.  Failure to comply with instructions, or provide complete information may affect the firms evaluation or disqualify the firm from further consideration.  Criteria are listed in descending order of importance.  

1.	Specialized Recent Relevant Experience/Technical Competence.
2.	Professional Qualifications of the Key Personnel
3.	Capacity to Accomplish Work and Ability to Accomplish Multiple Projects Concurrently 
4.	Past Performance on Relevant Contracts 
5.	Quality Control Program
6.
 	Firms Location in the General Geographical Area of the Project and Knowledge of the 
	Locality of the Project
7.	Small Business Utilization
8. 	Volume of Work Awarded by DoD During the Previous 12 Months 

Projects submitted in the SF-330 shall be projects completed by the prime firm and any team subconsultant.  Projects not performed by the prime firm and any team subconsultant will be excluded from further consideration. It is anticipated that interviews for slated firms will be conducted in Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI.

Firms that are submitting information as a Joint Venture (JV) or a Limited Liability Company (LLC) shall submit their JV Agreement and/or LLC Operating Agreement as an attachment.
  Failure to do so will result in the rejection of the SF330 from further consideration.    In addition, please ensure that the agreements address the following:

a.  A detailed statement outlining the following in terms of percentages where appropriate:
   (1)  The relationship of the team/partners/parties in terms of business ownership, capital contribution, profit distribution or loss sharing.
   (2)  The management approach in terms of who will conduct, direct, supervise, and control.
   (3)  The structure and decision-making responsibilities of the partners/parties in terms of who will control the manner and method of performance of work.
   (4)  Identify (by name and title) the personnel having the authority to legally bind the partners/parties (including authority to execute the contract documents).
b.
  A list of partners/parties, to include company name, DUNS and CAGE numbers, address, point of contact, Email address, phone number and facsimile number.

If the firm is a JV, information regarding the performance of recent, relevant projects shall be submitted to demonstrate the capabilities of the joint venture entity; however, if there is an insufficient amount of or no information relevant to the joint venture, information pertaining to each joint venture team member/partner shall be submitted.

If a project submitted to demonstrate experience and past performance was performed by a JV, and not all JV team members/partners that performed the work remain on the JV team responding to this synopsis, the submission should only address the work performed by team members/partners to the JV responding to this synopsis.
 (For instance, if a past performance project was performed by a JV with partners A, B, C, and D and the JV is now composed of partners A, C, D, and E, the description of experience and past performance on the project should focus on the work performed by partners A, C, and D only). Likewise, if the JV firm or one of its team members/partners worked as a subcontractor on a project submitted to establish experience and past performance, the description should clearly describe the roles and responsibilities and work actually performed by the JV firm or team member/partner, rather than the work performed by the prime contractor or other subcontractors on the project as a whole. The submission should also state the percentage of the total project value performed under the subcontract.
 If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed and the percentage of the total contract performed by the JV or its team members/partners responding to this solicitation, the project may be eliminated from consideration due to the inability to accurately assess relevance and experience.

If a firm is utilizing or relying on experience or past performance information from affiliates/subsidiaries/parent companies/LLC/LTD member companies (where the name of the entity is not exactly as stated on the SF330), the proposal shall clearly demonstrate that the affiliate/subsidiary/parent firm/LLC/LTD member companies will have meaningful involvement in the performance of the contract in order for the experience,  past performance, and/or key personnel information of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent firm/LLC/LTD member companies to be considered.
  The proposal shall state the specific resources (e.g., workforce, management, facilities, or other resources) that the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies will commit toward the performance of the contract.  If meaningful involvement is not demonstrated in the proposal, the affiliate, subsidiary or parent companys experience or past performance and/or key personnel information will not be considered.

A subcontractors experience and past performance will not be given the same level of consideration as that of either a prime contractor or a joint venture member/partner because there is no direct legal relationship between the Government and a subcontractor.  

Criterion 1- Specialized Recent Relevant Experience/Technical Competence

Basis of Evaluation:  SF330s shall be evaluated on specialized experience on recent, relevant projects for the prime firm and proposed team subcontractors in performing multiple projects involving field investigations and preparing studies/analysis/work plans/remediation oversight for environmental restoration projects and other technical support services consistent with the intended scope in Attachment A.

	Project cost.
	Project/site size (land area and/or depth).
	Types and complexity of work performed in the projects.

<DESC>This is the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support synopsis for adding items to the Boeing RoR BOA N00383-17-G-A301.  Boeing (CAGE 0PXV4), St. Louis, MO is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only known source to possess full repair capability.  Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government.   

For a list of all items to be repaired or any questions concerning this notice, contact Jacob Segal, N722.03, 215-697-4835).

The subject items require Government Source Approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for repair of these items has been solicited.
  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure (available at: https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx).  This brochure identifies the technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in repair of the same or similar item(s), or if your company has never repaired the same or similar item(s). If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this procurement.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Space must be located in a quality building in a primecommercial office district with attractive, prestigious,&nbsp;professional surroundings with a prevalence of modern design and/or tasteful rehabilitation in modern use. Multi-use flex space and space in light industrial park settings will not be considered to meet these standards. Streets and public sidewalks must be well maintained.
<p>To allow for visibility to the public, the government office space shall be located not more than the equivalent of two city blocks from a primary or secondary street serving the office. The lessor shall provide acceptable signage from the primary or secondary street at no separate cost. The route from the primary or secondary street shall be direct. Locations which have obscure, difficult access or which require multiple turns<br />shall not be considered.</p>
<p>The location should not be located within the immediate&nbsp;vicinity of railroad tracks. Sites which are located directly on or near a roadway which presents a hazard to our customers will not be considered.<br /><br />Determinations of hazardous access will be determined by the Government. Examples of such sites include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Sites located directly on a highway or six lane&nbsp;thoroughfare if:<br />&bull; Ease of access to and availability of public transportation and parking for visitors and employees.<br />&bull; Sites which are located directly on a highway or six lane thoroughfare shall not be considered in the following<br />instances:<br />o If the two directions of traffic are separated by a&nbsp;physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within one block, or&#894;<br />o If the access is directly from the highway, unless there&nbsp;is a traffic control device within two blocks or equivalent from the proposed office space.<br />o There are no pedestrian sidewalks that allow easy&nbsp;access to and from the office.</p>
<p>Access from outside to agency space within the building must provide access for wheelchair traffic. The primary entrance must be accessible for all persons with special needs. Street level contiguous (same floor) space is preferred. Contiguous upper floor space on one floor that meets the Government lease criteria and has handicapped accessible elevator service to the government office floor is an acceptable alternative. We prefer that the storage and/or Interactive Video Tele-training (IVT) rooms be located contiguous with the main office space. However, these rooms only, and their associated square footage, may be separated from the main office area by a public corridor. Elevator service shall consist of a minimum of&nbsp;two accessible elevators that serve the floor proposed for the government. One of the accessible elevators may serve as a freight elevator.</p>
<p>It is a requirement that overall dimensions of the space shall have a maximum length to width ratio of 2 to 1. Preference will be given to blocks of space that allow maximum flexibility for furniture placement, i.e., few or no columns or other obstructions, rectangular in shape, no curves or offsets, and with large open areas. Space requiring ramps inside the office will not be acceptable. Columns must be at least 20 feet from any interior wall and from each other (clear distance) and be no more than 2 feet square.</p>
<p>The Government requires sufficient general parking as specified by local code requirements. The Government requests that, due to budgetary costs, the cost of this parking be included as part of the rental consideration. In some instances, the Government will request parking for carpools, disabled employees, and in and out parking for employee use and for program purposes.</p>
<p>The parking-to-square-foot ratio available on site shall at least meet current local code requirements, or, in absence of a local code requirement, on site parking shall be available at a ratio of 1 space for every 200 RSF of Government demised area.</p>
<p>When the Government is the only building tenant and/or the only tenant utilizing the parking lot, additional accessible parking spaces for the disabled beyond those otherwise required or existing, (whichever is greater) shall be provided based on the size of the office. This shall be in addition to any reserved parking required by the Government for employees with disabilities.</p>
<p>When the government is to be located in a multi tenant&nbsp;building in a downtown location, parking for the disabled shall be provided:<br /><br />(1) In an adjoining parking lot or garage with a fully accessible route to the office. Quantity shall be five spaces in addition to existing disabled parking provided or in addition to disabled spaces required by code, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>(2) Along city streets, by having the city provide a minimum number of disabled spaces, in addition to any existing or otherwise planned or required spaces within 1/2 block from the accessible entrance (see schedule above). Written assurance by the city shall be requested indicating that the spaces shall be restricted for usage by the disabled during the tenancy of the Government.</p>
<p>When public transportation is available, passenger stops must be within two blocks of the space. In suburban areas, in small communities and in areas of major cities where adequate public transportation and on site parking are not available, secure vehicle parking facilities MUST be available at reasonable commercial rates for visitors and employees within a two block radius of the space. Secure parking is defined as parking that meets Federal Protective Service guidelines and should be resolved before any lease is signed. "Reasonable Rates" will be determined by local pricing levels.</p>
<p>In those locations where on site parking is not available parking for the disabled must be located within the same&nbsp;block.</p>
<p>Restricted or metered parking of one hour or less within the two block area of the space does not meet parking&nbsp;requirements. This is because many Government contacts with the public cannot be completed within one hour.</p>

Responses to this sources sought will not be returned. The Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to the respondents with respect to any of the information submitted under this sources sought. In order to protect the integrity of any possible future acquisition, no additional information will be provided and no appointments for presentations will be made in reference to this sources sought.</p>
<p>Only government employees will review submitted responses to this sources sought. Respondents are advised that employees of commercial firms under contract with the Government may be used to administratively process submissions and perform other administrative duties requiring access to other contractor's proprietary information.

<DESC><strong>I. BACKGROUND</strong> <br /><br />The United States Capitol ("Capitol") in Washington, D.C., is a symbol of the American people and their government and the meeting place of the nation's legislature. The Capitol also houses an important collection of American art, and it is an architectural achievement in its own right. It is a working office building as well as a tourist attraction. The Architect of the Capitol ("AOC" or "Government"), an agency of the legislative branch, manages the facilities comprising the Capitol complex. The U.S. Capitol Visitor Center ("CVC" or "Government") is the newest addition to the Capitol complex. The mission of the CVC is to provide a welcoming and educational environment for visitors to learn about the unique characteristics of the House and the Senate and the legislative process, as well as the history and development of the architecture and art of the Capitol. This is accomplished, in part, by the provision of free tours to the visiting public, educational programs, and the provision of spaces for Congressional events. The CVC provides an increased focus on visitor comfort, safety and security resulting in a seamless, positive visitor experience at the Capitol. The CVC welcomes millions of visitors to the Capitol each year. <br /><br />The hours of operation for the CVC are 8:30am-4:30pm Eastern Standard Time (EST), Monday through Saturday. The CVC Gift Shops provide a wide variety of items for sale to the general public oriented to the U.S. Congress with an emphasis on education. These products and gifts are often provided on an exclusive basis to the Gift Shops for retail sale. The Gift Shops operate in two locations on the first floor of the CVC. The Gift Shops are supported by an inventory storage area within the CVC. <br /><br /><strong>II. PURPOSE <br /></strong><br /><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOTICE ONLY.</strong>This RFI is for informational and planning purposes only and it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of materials, machinery, or services. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI are solely at the responding parties' expense. Respondents are solely responsible for properly marking and clearly identifying any proprietary information or trade secrets contained within their response. The Government will not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly marked and clearly identified. Proprietary information received in response to this sources sought will be safeguarded and handled in accordance with applicable Government regulations. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI become Government property and will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued. Small businesses with the capability to meet the requirements are encouraged to reply to this RFI. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. Potential responders are responsible for monitoring this site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.

<p>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS).  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references highlighting these capabilities. It is not sufficient to provide only general brochures or generic information. Capability Statement(s) shall include a list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number) and the specific area of interest in this acquisition as being either a potential prime contractor or subcontractor.</p>

<p>Industry is invited to review the questions listed below and provide feedback on the specific areas requested.</p>
<p>(1)	What changes from the current ETS contracting approach, if any, would you suggest for the follow-on ETSII contract and why? At a minimum please address each of the following items below: Contract Content, Contract Type, and Contract Structure. For your proposed contract structure address how will safety performance and evaluation support be enhanced?  Additionally address any performance standards, or methods of work authorization which should be considered by NASA.</p>
<p>(2)	Identify barriers to competition that could be mitigated to foster a more competitive environment for this procurement.</p>
<p>(3)	The current ETS contract does not include fixed-price work, discuss whether a hybrid contract (cost and fixed price) is appropriate and identify your approach for administering and managing a hybrid contract if feasible.</p>
<p>(4)	Contract Incentives:  Provide feedback regarding incentive arrangements.  For instance, how should "risks versus rewards" be shared by the Government and contractor?  What types of incentives would you consider to be most effective to encourage the contractor to perform high quality work at a reasonable price? Discuss your views specific to ETSII regarding incentive fees, award fee, or other appropriate incentives for contractor performance in terms of: 1. Fixed-price requirements; 2. Cost type requirements.</p>
<p>(5)	Identify any portion(s) of this procurement for which fixed-price contracting could be utilized and provide rationale and feasibility. Identify any portion(s) of this procurement for which fixed price contracting could not be utilized and provide rationale.</p>
<p>(6)	Metrics and Measures of Success: Provide feedback on metrics or measures of success NASA might consider to monitor the contractor's performance on the potential fixed-price or incentive fee portions, as well as the portions that are not fixed-price.</p>
<p>(7)	Discuss ways in which NASA could design/structure this procurement to maximize synergy between the labor skills needed for employees across the contract, and how to best cross-utilize the workforce. Discuss all alternatives you would like NASA to consider.</p>
<p>(8)	NASA is considering ways to increase the use of these unique or not otherwise commercially available facilities/capabilities by non-Government customers, on a mission non-interference basis, as a potential means of reducing long-term costs.  Under the current ETS contract, NASA allows the contractor non-exclusive use of AFRC facilities operated by the contractor under the ETS contract to perform work for non-Government customers on a reimbursable basis.  Please discuss thoughts on how to structure this contract or implement incentives to encourage the contractor's efforts to find additional non-Government customers for unique AFRC facilities on a mission non-interference basis.</p>
<p>(9)	What recommendations do you have for cost estimating tools on large Government contracts?</p>
<p>(10)	What kind of efficiencies/innovations has your company successfully implemented on other similar facilities and/or contracts?  Were there contract barriers that needed to be overcome for successful implementation?</p>
<p>(11)	Describe the benefits of a contract period of performance greater than 5 years.  What advantages and disadvantages does a greater than 5 year contract provide?</p>
<p>(12)	Describe the effect a 1-year award fee period would have on your ability to perform on this contract.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes, therefore, in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) this RFI shall not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this market research.  The information received will not be released in its submitted form, to the extent permitted by law, but may be used in developing the best approach for any follow-on contract strategy and therefore may be recognizable.  The contractor is responsible for marking any proprietary information included with its submission.

The delineated area is as follows:

The space must be handicapped accessible, ADA compliant, and can be provided by new construction or modification of an existing space. If not a new building, the space offered shall be in a building that has undergone, or will complete by occupancy, modernization or adaptive reuse for the Space with modern conveniences.

This is typically characterized by activities which establish and maintain stable, diverse plant communities comprised of native species exhibiting non-conflicting mature growth heights. These types of plant communities are compatible with transmission system operations, provide important ecological functions, and naturally discourage the re-growth of incompatible tall growth species. WAPA's approach is further directed at reducing the frequency and overall intensity of future treatments, which reduces undesirable environmental disturbance, while significantly reducing the risk of unintended power delivery interruptions.</span></p>

<DESC><p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) , Homeland Security Investigations(HSI) has a critical investigative mission. HSI is a vital U.S. asset in combating criminal organizations illegally exploiting America's travel, trade, financial and immigration systems.</p>
<p>The threats presented by criminals in these areas have far-reaching consequences. In response, HSI uses a versatile approach to conducting its operations so that it can achieve the best results for the nation and its people.</p>
<p>In pursuit of this mission, a variety of tools and techniques are utilized to further criminal investigations:</p>
<p>Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act of 1968 (Wiretap Act) as amended provides the statutory framework that governs real-time electronic surveillance of the contents of communications. The Title III act establishes procedures agencies must follow to obtain a federal court order to authorize the interception of oral, wire and electronic communications (known as a Title III or wiretap). This act regulates how law enforcement agents can use and further disclose information obtained under a Title III order.</p>
<p>Transcriptions for Title III monitoring include the translation of written, electronic and multi-media material to and from English and native Foreign languages. These services can also be applied to pre-recorded audio, video media, consensual recording; as well as written and hard-copy media stemming from criminal investigations.</p>
<p>ICE may also require services, such as, data analysis, interview support, monitoring and interception to be performed overseas in a Government furnished facility. These services would be in direct support of domestic and foreign law enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>Additionally, a variety of language barriers are typically encountered during routine law enforcement duties. In an effort to mitigate these language barriers, general translation, transcription and interpretation services are required.</p>
<p>ICE may require translation, transcription and/or interpretation services for English to English, English to native foreign language, and native foreign language to English.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish all personnel and all necessary equipment, materials and supplies, transportation, security clearance, background investigation verification necessary to perform Title III&nbsp;Wiretap and General Translation, Transcription and Interpretation Services well as all other work described in this requirements statement.</p>
<p>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request of information (RFI) does not commit the Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense.</p>

NIST does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice, or otherwise pay for the information requested.

<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) Department of Commerce (DOC) is responsible for conducing audits, management reviews, and investigations. The Office of Investigations (OI) is one of the business units within the OIG. This unit's mission is to conduct investigations, and this investigation can be administrative, civil or criminal in nature. Most criminal investigations involve grant or contract fraud and administrative investigations involve ethics violation or employee misconduct.</p>
<p>OI is currently using a web-based investigative electronic case management system capable of tracking and managing investigations from beginning to end. An example is an investigation is typically initiated from complaints related to waste, fraud and abuse in departmental programs and operations. Some complaints may result in management action, monetary recovery, and prosecution. Proper handling of these cases requires that all relevant information be collected, case activity be tracked by OI personnel, and investigative steps and actions be recorded, and approved. A variety of reports both internal and external are produced that are used by the OIG senior management and external individuals or agencies to track case status, activity, and may be used for prosecution or administrative action.</p>
<p>The current OIG case management system is comprised of a customized SQL Server database, a java-based web application based on an COTS open business process management platform for case management, and a web reporting module together with a data analytics module for data reporting and analysis. Configurations and customizations were applied to support specific OIG complaint tracking and investigation processes, with automated system monitoring and notifications. OIG is interested to explore other COTS solutions that can potentially further improve on our current case management system with benefits of lower IT maintenance and operation costs, improved system-wide stability, improved data and web app security, FEDRAMP-certified cloud hosting, record management features compliant to federal record management standards such as NARA and DOD5015.2.OIG is planning to acquire a new case management system, and is looking for a true COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) software solution that supports web-based operations with improvements in system stability, response time, audit trails, and allow potential future expansion of business requirements and scope of information being collected, tracked and reported.</p>
<p>Requirement:</p>
<p>NIST is seeking information on contractors who can provide services/solutions based on the following requirement description:</p>
<p>Lot 1 - Case Management System (CMS) - OIG is planning to acquire a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) case management system (CMS), with minimal custom-configuration to OIG requirements, to track and manage all investigation-related activities, including hotline information, investigation case management, personnel and criminal intelligence data, etc. The new CMS shall provide the ability to communicate investigation information and data to senior management, supervisors, and investigators via email notification, and/or pre-packaged or customized reports and through dashboard display. OIG IT infrastructure is predominantly a Microsoft Windows environment (Windows 2012R2 servers with Hyper-V virtual machines, Window 7 client machines (soon to updated to Windows 10 and Office 2016)), within a single domain. OIG primary messaging system is Microsoft Exchange 2010 system (soon to be upgraded to Office 365), and Microsoft SharePoint 2013. SharePoint provides major web and publishing portals, collaboration and content management tools. OIG uses Microsoft Office Professional as its primary office support application on a Windows OS.</p>
<p>In addition to describing your company's solution, please attempt to address the following topics in your response: <br />A. What are the cost benefits of your recommendation?<br />B. What are the security benefits or your recommendation?<br />C. Are there other agencies that you can provide an example as to using your recommendation? If so, please do so.<br /><br />It is unclear what loading impact this service would have on the network for the regional offices, which are linked back to headquarters with a 10 MBS VPLS connection for each site. For planning purposes, the regional offices have approximately three employees at each of the four sites.<br />D. What are the bandwidth requirements for remote offices using this service on a per user basis? <br />E. What portions of this project do you see: 1) Federal employees undertaking, 2) Migration services performing, 3) Your company as the project coordinator performing.</p>

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>Background: <br />A newly renovated space at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) requires testing boxes. In testing nonhuman primates for the purpose of electrophysiological experiments, it is critical to have isolation boxes of a certain size and with certain properties. The animal is tested within the box in the awake state as the electrical activity in the brain is measured. As this is a sensitive measurement in the microvolt range, it is critical that the testing boxes have the appropriate electrical properties and shielding capabilities. The testing requires metallic Faraday cages that are custom made to fit the room dimensions, with the appropriate door size and demonstrable connections to the building ground.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement:<br />The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the National Institute of Mental Health with testing booths for a newly renovated lab space.</p>

<DESC>I. DESCRIPTION
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only. The Space and Missile Systems Center, Space Superiority Systems Directorate, Space Command and Control Mission Integration Branch (SMC/SYFJ) last solicited information from industry to support the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) Increment 3 requirements in April 2014 (#FA8819-14-JMS-INC3). The JMS Increment 3 is now known as the Enterprise Space Battle Management Command and Control (ESBMC2) System. The Government is seeking additional input for the following three (3) topic areas.</p>
<p>Topic 1: Industry Capabilities for New Requirements<br />Topic 2: Feedback on Five Focus Area Approach<br />Topic 3: New Progress from Industry</p>
<p>See Section III of this document for specific details regarding information sought under this RFI.</p>
<p>II. PROGRAM OVERVIEW</p>
<p>Mission Description</p>
<p>The program supports the Joint Functional Component Command for Space (JFCC-SPACE) mission to continuously coordinate, plan, integrate, synchronize, and execute space operations to provide tailored space effects and deny the adversary the ability to do the same in support of national objectives and the Combatant Commanders.</p>
<p>The JSpOC is the United States' command and control center for space. It maintains 24/7 custody of all active and inactive satellites and debris in orbit around the earth. The ESBMC2 System will replace certain&nbsp;legacy JSpOC systems and provide new capabilities to the warfighter.</p>
<p>The Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC) is a partnership between United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the Intelligence Community (IC), and commercial data providers. The JICSpOC will leverage existing JSpOC systems and integrate them with new capabilities to better enable unity of effort between the Department of Defense and the IC for space operations. ESBMC2 system scope extends past the JSpOC alone; the program office envisions that any capabilities developed will also support the JICSpOC.</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>In 2015, the JMS Capability Development Document (CDD) was updated with the addition of three (3) new space BMC2-related Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and two (2) new space BMC2-related Key System Attributes (KSAs). Figure 1 in Attachment 1 shows the KPP, KSA, and OSA requirements allocated to each increment of the JMS program. Requirements highlighted in green are specifically aligned to the new ESBMC2 System (previously Increment 3). See Attachment 1 for the details of these new requirements.</p>
<p>Program Acquisition Approach<br />The Government intends to competitively award efforts focused on characterizing the maturity of technologies related to the ESBMC2 System five focus areas (see Attachment 2) beginning in the FY17 timeframe through a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The BAA utilizes a two-phased approach and is planned to be open for approximately 60 months. The first phase will request White Papers that will then be followed by a second phase consisting of Request for Proposals (RFPs). Results of this RFI may inform language in the BAA.</p>
<p>Other Related Efforts<br />Other agencies also are seeking information from industry in the Enterprise Space BMC2 mission area. These efforts are related but not duplicative. The Government will share information where possible across these efforts to ensure maximum utility. Recent market research efforts publicized on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO, FedBizOpps.gov) are listed below:</p>
<p>&bull; The 50th Contracting Squadron issued the Commercial Space Situational Awareness (SSA) capabilities RFI gain information regarding the "collection of non-governmental SSA data, processing tools, personnel, and contracted support" for the Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC) (#FA2550-16-R-8002).</p>
<p>&bull; The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) issued the Test Bed RFI to advance the "state-of-the-art test bed capabilities, tailored for space applications" (#RFI-RVKVV-TBSA-2016).</p>
<p>&bull; The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is concurrently working the long-term challenges for Enterprise Space BMC2 through the Hallmark program and has issued the Hallmark Software Testbed BAA to "design, develop, and maintain a state-of-the-art enterprise software architecture for the integration of multiple tools and capabilities for supporting space enterprise command and control" (#DARPA-BAA-16-40). DARPA has issued a follow-on BAA focused on tools, capabilities and evaluation methodology to "develop and validate analytic and human-centric technologies for enabling the full spectrum of military space enterprise command and control capabilities for the commander" (#DARPA-BAA-16-49).</p>
<p>&bull; Advanced Research, Collaboration, and Application Development Environment (ARCADE). The ESBMC2 Program Office has partnered with the AFRL to bring an ESBMC2-relevant environment across several different security enclaves to future developers. This environment is called the ARCADE and is currently managed by AFRL. ARCADE provides an environment to mature capabilities prior to potentially entering the ESBMC2 integration pipeline. Additional information on the ARCADE program can be requested through Dr. Jeremy Murray-Krezan at jeremy.murray-krezan@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>A secondary purpose of ARCADE is to encourage capability providers to collaborate and leverage accredited tools, common services, and data sources in the pursuit of a more advanced set of capabilities. The use of ARCADE to demonstrate capability or application maturity is not necessary if the goals can be demonstrated elsewhere. Finally, the most mature and promising ARCADE tools are nominated for exercises with users, thus providing developers and the program office with early feedback as to the relevance of how well the vetted tools are meeting mission needs and addressing gaps.</p>
<p>III. INFORMATION SOUGHT</p>
<p>This RFI seeks information from industry on the following topics:</p>
<p>Topic 1: Industry Capabilities for New Requirements <br />Capabilities that fulfill or enable fulfillment of the following five (5) new requirements for the ESBMC2 System (see Attachment 1), including but not limited to, Technology Readiness Level (TRL), Equivalent Source Lines of Code (ESLOC) and the methodology used to calculate TRL and ESLOC, for each:</p>
<p>1. Threat Identification &amp; Warning <br />2. Spectrum Common Operating Picture <br />3. Modelling &amp; Simulation for Course of Action Development <br />4. Battle Management Command &amp; Control (BMC2) <br />5. Dynamic Tasking</p>
<p>Industry should not provide duplicative information from the previous RFI (#FA8819-14-JMS-INC3); instead, responses should focus on new and updated capabilities that address the new ESBMC2 System requirements referenced in Attachment 1.</p>
<p>Topic 2: Feedback on Five Focus Area Approach<br />The Government requests feedback on the Government's Five Focus Area Approach for the ESBMC2 System (see Attachment 2). These five focus areas are intended to represent the programmatic decomposition of the requirements specific to the ESBMC2 System (see Attachment 1). They are a primer to provide insight into the Government's approach to fulfilling these requirements. Feedback on this approach is being sought to understand industry capabilities and assist the Government in developing a high level, functional system architecture and acquisition strategy that maximizes the benefits of full and open competition.</p>
<p>Highlight what additional information the Government could provide to better define the approach. Identify any factors that likely contribute to the reduction of uncertainty to developing a contractor proposal, rating those as high or low as to degree of risk to the offeror. For high risk drivers, explain why the risk is high and suggest how the Government might mitigate this risk.</p>
<p>Topic 3: New Progress from Industry<br />The Government requests an update on any industry capabilities, additional considerations, developments, or potential focus areas for the risk characterization of key technologies in the Enterprise Space BMC2 mission area since the previous RFI. The Government is interested in both commercial and Government capabilities of varying TRLs.</p>
<p>Response Requirements<br />The Government requests the responses be submitted in a PowerPoint presentation (in Portable Document Format (PDF)) clearly describing the rationale of each capability's maturity, cost, architecture, workflow processes, ESLOC, TRL and derivation methodology for ESLOC and TRL. Responses must include a cover letter (see Section IV) with all submittals. PowerPoint presentations are limited to no more than five (5) slides each for Topics 1 &amp; 3 and ten (10) slides for Topic 2; twenty (20) slides total. There is no minimum number of topics areas industry must respond to; industry may provide feedback on one or all topics.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. THIS IS&nbsp;A SOLE SOUTCE NOTIFICATION TO AWARD MUTLI YEAR CONTRACT TO VECTRONICS AEROSPACE.<br /><br />1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING <br />ACTIVITY:</p>
<p>Requesting Agency: <br />APHIS/WS/NATIONAL FERAL SWINE DAMAGE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (NFSDMP)<br /><br />Contracting Activity:<br />USDA, APHIS, MRPBS, ASD<br />Minneapolis Procurement Branch<br />Butler Square, Fifth Floor<br />100 North 6th Street<br />Minneapolis, MN 55403</p>
<p>2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING <br />APPROVED: <br />Satellite/GPS Tracking Services for Vectronic Aerospace GmbH GPS collars to track feral swine.</p>
<p>3. A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES, EQUIPMENT, OR SERVICES <br />REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED <br />VALUE OF THE ACQUISITION INCLUSIVE OF OPTIONS): <br />The NFSDMP has 50 Vectronic Aerospace GmbH iridium GPS collars that only function with GlobalStar satellites. Vectronic Aerospace GmbH retrieves GPS collar data and shares results with the program. The GlobalStar service will allow the NFSDMP to track invasive feral swine across the nation. The NFSDMP goal is to reduce feral swine damage and this service will allow us to assist state programs with tracking and gaining a better understanding of the feral swine ecology to help us manage them. The subscription for Iridium and GlobalStar will allow USDA to track the feral swine movement.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUATORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING <br />NONCOMPETITIVE ACQUISITIONS: <br />FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE <br />QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES <br />USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:<br />Vectronic Aerospace Collars are only compatible with GlobalStar satellites.</p>
<p>6. A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE <br />SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS, OR WILL BE, PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 5.2, AND IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER FAR 5.202 APPLIES: <br />When researching and obtaining prices for our 50 GPS collars, most iridium collars used GlobalStar as the service provider. There are no other vendors for iridium based GPS collars and because Vectronic designed their collars to work off GlobalStar satellites, this is our only option.</p>
<p>7. A DETERMINATION THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE, AND THE BASIS FORTHAT DETERMINATION:<br />Previously, Vectronics charged the Government $18.75 for monthly subscription fee and tiny_mce_marker.03 per transmitted GPS location fee. They are currently offering us the same rate for the next 3 years from 03/01/2017 through 12/31/2019 with an estimated total of $34,000 for 40 collars. Based on historical pricing, the Government has determined that Vectronics pricing is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>8. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED (FAR <br />PART 10) AND THE RESULTS, OR AN EXPLANATION OF THE REASON <br />MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT PERFORMED:<br />We have worked with GPS collars for over 12 years and have continuously worked with vendors on their products. We have reached out to our POC within the industry leaders and they provided us with the latest technology that meets our current needs. Most vendors carry iridium collars but all have a slight difference in collar design and options associated with the collar. <br /><br />9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL <br />AND OPEN COMPETITION - FAR 6.303-2(a)(9):<br />Vectronic Aerospace Collars are only compatible with GlobalStar satellites.<br /><br /><br />For inquireies regarding this special notice, please contact Kimyen Tu via email only at <a href="mailto:kimyen.n.tu@aphis.usda.gov">kimyen.n.tu@aphis.usda.gov</a>. All inquires are due January 20th, 2017 by 10am central time.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 7, WJB Dorn Medical Center, Columbia, SC hereby provides notice of its intent to award a sole-source, firm fixed contract to GenMark Diagnostics, Address: 5964 La Place Ct. Carlsbad, CA, 92008-8829. The anticipated procurement is for a base year and four one-year option periods. Funding for the base year will be less than $500,000.  The contract will be awarded under FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and FAR 13.501(a).  A Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared. The period of performance shall be 12 months starting January 16, 2017.
The contract will:
Purchase Ensor HCV genotype kits from GenMark Diagnostics to perform patient testing to identify HCV genotypes 1 thru 6 in the treatment of positive HCV patients.  The GenMark HCV Genotype test provides 18 different markers which allows for more accurate diagnostic.  The reagent improves patient HCV genotype testing with accurate readability and requires no interpretation from the technologist or is subjective to interpretation.
The service required meets the Department of Veterans Affairs legal obligation to continue developing and supporting the purchase Ensor HCV genotype kits to perform patient testing to identify HCV genotypes 1 thru 6 in the treatment of positive HCV patients.  The requirement is being procured as a sole source because current instrumentation is specifically tailored to the Dorn VA Lab. The Department of Veterans Affairs believes that awarding the proposed contract to another source would result in unacceptable delays in meeting this legal obligation, as well as substantial additional costs to the government, as the new source gradually developed the skills needed to meet the Department of Veterans Affairs requirements.
Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The Department of Veterans Affairs will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice of intent. Only written responses will be considered.  All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered. As a result of analyzing responses to this notice of intent, the Government shall determine that a solicitation will be issued. Any prospective contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to be eligible for award.  Information concerning SAM registered requirements may be viewed via the Internet at https://www.uscontractorregistration.com/ by calling the SAM Registration Center at 1-877-332-8277.

<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Building 301, Room B129, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899-1640</p>
<p><br />NIST does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice and otherwise pay for the information requested. No entitlement or payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by NIST will arise as a result of submission of responses to this Notice and NIST use of such information. NIST recognizes that proprietary components, interfaces and equipment, and clearly mark restricted or proprietary components, interfaces and equipment, and clearly mark restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. In the absence of such identification, NIST will assume to have unlimited rights to all technical data in the information paper.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br />The Heat Transfer and Alternative Energy Systems Group at NIST maintains the NIST500 mm and 1016 mm Guarded Hot Plate Facilities for the determination of steady-state thermal transmission properties of industrial insulation. A critical mission of these facilities is the development and characterization of thermal insulation reference materials. Thermal insulation reference materials are utilized by NIST customers for the calibration and validation of their thermal conductivity instruments. NIST issues thermal insulation Standard Reference Materials to the public through the NIST Office of Reference Materials.</p>
<p>Standard Reference Material 1450d, Fibrous Glass Board, is projected to be out of stock due to above average annual sales. A replacement batch, designated as 1450e, is now required. Procurement of the replacement batch is to be accomplished in two phases. NIST intends to analyze the responses submitted to this notice to identify vendors that can provide samples that meet NIST's criteria. In Phase I, NIST intends to procure a sample lot of 10 units from multiple vendors whose responses show that they can provide samples that meet NIST's criteria. The samples will be tested and analyzed by NIST using the factors established below. NIST intends to use the results of the testing of the aforementioned samples to help determine the acquisition strategy for the future Phase II procurement of approximately 450 units.</p>
<p>Draft Requirement:</p>
<p>NIST is seeking information on contractors who are capable of providing materials that meet the requirements below:</p>
<p>Material: The material is molded fibrous glass board, a specialty thermal insulation product that is manufactured by molding uncured rolls of fibrous-glass blanket under heat and pressure to provide a dense board at a specified thickness. Only molded unfaced fibrous-glass boards shall be acceptable because this material has superior density uniformity across the board.<br />Sample lot: The size of the sample lot shall consist of 10 units. The sample lot shall be manufactured from the same batch of raw material, i.e., manufactured from one continuous production run. The vendor shall provide a printed hardcopy of the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the material.<br />Minimum Technical Requirements: Each unit of the sample lot shall have the following minimum technical requirements to be evaluated by NIST as described below.</p>
<p>a) Bulk density: 8 pounds per cubic feet (pcf) &plusmn;10 percent determined gravimetrically.</p>
<p>b) Dimensional: 1 inch &plusmn;0.031 inch thickness, trimmed to a final size of 24 inch &plusmn;0.031 inch by 24 inch &plusmn;0.031 inch determined by linear height gage.</p>
<p>c)Thermal conductivity: 0.033 W/(m&#8729;K) &plusmn;5 percent determined using ASTM Test Method C 518, "Steady-State Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Heat-<br />Flow-Meter Apparatus".</p>
<p><br />Interested parties shall describe the capabilities and experience of their organization and personnel as it relates to the requirements described above. Respondents shall NOT respond to this notice by delivering actual sample materials to NIST. This notice is a request for a description of your company's capabilities and experience as they pertain to the requirements described above.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses. The small business size standard associated with the NAICS code for this effort, 327999, All Other Miscellaneous Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing with a size standard of 1,500 Employees. is $20.5 Million. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. Companies that can provide such services are requested to email a written response describing their abilities to Prateema.carvajal@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.</p>

<DESC><p>Title: Louisville District Corps of Engineers Soliciting Comments on the Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) at Rough River Dam.</p>
<p><br />Description:</p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:</p>
<p>Construction includes a complete 1600' long concrete cutoff wall through the embankment and into the foundation rock with treatment in and around the conduit, Rough River Dam, Falls of Rough, KY.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br />(2) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Louisville District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Louisville District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?</p>
<p>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to heather.d.bauer@usace.army.mil no later than by 10:00 AM ET on 24 January 2017.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe or ?Native'' as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203; 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601). Indian Economic Enterprise means any business activity owned by one or more Indians or Indian Tribes that is established for the purpose of profit, provided that: (i) The combined Indian or Indian Tribe ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise; (ii) The Indians or Indian Tribes shall, together, receive at least a majority of the earnings from the contract; and (iii) The management and daily business operations of an Indian economic enterprise must be controlled by one or more individuals who are members of an Indian Tribe.

The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods: (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation; (2) At the time of contract award; and, Cont... <BR> <BR>(3) During the full term of the contract. Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).

The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods: (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation; (2) At the time of contract award; and, Cont... <BR> <BR>(3) During the full term of the contract. Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601). Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.

(f) Eligibility. (1) Participation in the Mentor-Prot?g? Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an Indian economic enterprise ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.

The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to InBios International for antigens. These antigens developed by InBios are unique in that they can be used for detection of specific pathogens. No other company has developed these antigens. CDC employs these materials for conducting diagnosis of human disease under specific scientific and regulatory framework. Employing other materials would require duplication of effort and delays in providing services to the public. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1).. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within three (3) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to William Brannen at VWL0@cdc.gov by 3:00 P.M. EST., January 12, 2017.</p>

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

<p>(16) Description: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's medical research agency-making important discoveries that improve health and save lives. The Imaging Probe Development Center (IPDC) was initiated in the incubator space of the Common Fund and has transitioned to the intramural program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. It is dedicated to the production of new imaging probes for the intramural NIH research community. IPDC is administered by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for the benefit of the entire community of intramural NIH scientists, and is already working on projects for requesting scientists from more than a dozen NIH Institutes. Nearly all of these imaging probes are not commercially available, nor are they viable commercial products and most are new compositions-of-matter. A variety of techniques are used to analyze the prepared probes. The IPCD currently does not have ion chromatography capabilities. Ion chromatography (IC) is particular useful for ions and polar molecules, which can be difficult to resolve by reverse-phase HPLC. The primary use of the system will be for the analysis of 18F-NaBF4, for which the IPCD currently does not have an analysis method.<br /><br />(i) "This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The NIA Intramural Research Program performs a longitudinal study of the effects of race and socioeconomic status on healthy aging in a representative sample of community dwelling residents from the Baltimore metropolitan region. This study, known as the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study, requires a detailed knowledge of the public health characteristics of this region including racial, socioeconomic, and nutritional characteristics. This information is used to assess the influences of these factors on a variety of health outcomes such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functioning, psychophysiological and cognitive performance, and muscular strength and conditioning.</p>
<p>This requirement focuses on support for the nutritional aspects of the HANDLS study. Nutritional status influences an individual's risk for the development of chronic conditions, thereby affecting a person's ability to live a healthy and productive life. Therefore, nutrition science specific technique support, including nutritional monitoring and dietary recall, are required to determine the study population's nutritional status and the effects of nutritional status over the course of the longitudinal study.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br />The purpose of this requirement is to procure nutrition scientist consulting services in support of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) Study.

<p>Past Performance shall be evaluated for relevance to the current requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Technical proposals will be evaluated using a summary adjectival rating in accordance with the following scale:</strong><br /><br />Excellent<br />The proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes several advantageous characteristics of substance, and very few disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the proposal provides solutions which are unquestionably feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and<br />precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Very Low</p>
<p>Good<br />The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Low</p>
<p>Acceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect moderate risk in that they may be somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and/or demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Neutral</p>
<p>Marginal<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages present a low or questionable likelihood of resulting in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and/or do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: High</p>
<p>Unacceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has several disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are unlikely to result in satisfactory performance.

<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research, a consortium of 15 NIH Institutes and Centers that support neuroscience research, established the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) as a pipeline between the typical endpoint of NIH-funded research and the beginning of industry drug development. The BPN provides neuroscience researchers with funding and access to a full range of industry-style drug discovery and development services and expertise.</p>
<p>The BPN program is intended for projects requiring medicinal chemistry optimization and CRO support through phase I clinical testing. Each project is directed by a Lead Development Team composed of the principal investigator, industry consultants hired by NIH, and NIH staff. This team maps out a research strategy, including milestones, and oversees implementation by contract research providers. Bioactivity and efficacy studies are funded through an award to the principal investigator; other research services are provided without cost to the PI through NIH contracts.</p>
<p>The BPN External Oversight Committee (EOC) was instituted in late 2011 and will continue through 2027 or until all of the projects in the Network are completed. The NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) oversees the EOC. The EOC typically convenes monthly via web-enabled virtual meetings and teleconference calls. Additionally, the EOC meets once per year at NIH for a day long face to face meeting and on an ad hoc basis to evaluate BPN project specific issues.  These additional meetings of the EOC are scheduled around EOC member availability and full participation in such scheduled events is expected.</p>

<p><br />1. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Weather Service Alaskan Region installed a centralized telecommunication system supporting the communication needs for the three forecast offices located in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau. The Avaya IP 500 system is currently supported by Alaska Communication System (ACS). This centralized telecommunication system supports day to day telephone communication needs and emergency communications, such as E911. The infrastructure, two each DS-1's at each location is also supported by ACS to ensure full 24/7 hardware and software support for each office. In the event of a failure ACS has the trained technicians and software engineers need in the event of a failure during a critical event.</p>
<p>The installation of the Avaya IP 500's in 2016 had a one year 24/7 support agreement contact included in the original bid, and the National Weather Service has the intention of continuing this support via a 3 year 24/7 maintenance agreement to include software upgrades, hardware outages and call management support, which is now ending.</p>
<p>2. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>Provide local technical support in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau. The contractor will have the infrastructure to reduce, if not remediate, any outages or degradation to the system with a monitoring management system support. Provide a critical fault escalation priority 1 and major fault escalation priority 2 lists for the National Weather Service needs in Alaska, in the event of a Public Switched Telephone Network outage.</p>
<p>This 24 hour, 7 days a week, 365 days a year maintenance agreement is necessary to support telecommunication needs in the Anchorage Forecast Office, the River Forecast Center, the Alaska Weather Aviation Unit, the Juneau Forecast Office and the Fairbanks Forecast Office.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.27 per hour or $170.80 per week or $740.13 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin<br />Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day,<br />Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and<br />Christmas Day.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

Indian Economic Enterprise means any business activity owned by one or more Indians or Indian Tribes that is established for the purpose of profit, provided that: (i) The combined Indian or Indian Tribe ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise; (ii) The Indians or Indian Tribes shall, together, receive at least a majority of the earnings from the contract; and (iii) The management and daily business operations of an Indian economic enterprise must be controlled by one or more individuals who are members of an Indian Tribe.

The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods: (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation; (2) At the time of contract award; and, Cont... <BR> <BR>(3) During the full term of the contract. Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601). Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.

<DESC><p>Strong Bonds Program for Couples<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>Basis of Award: in evaluating offers the Government is looking for the best value and will consider both price and non-price factors (including distance and past performance).</p>
<p>This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This solicitation is set aside for small business. The NAICS code that applies is 721110. Small Business Size Standard is $32.5 Million.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Strong Bonds is provided by the Air National Guard Chaplain Corps to provide training in a safe, low-threat environment, where individuals &amp; couples can develop key skills necessary to build effective relationships.

The focus is on developing whole, happy, resilient relationships.<br />CT Air National Guard requires a contractor to provide a facility and all personnel, supervision, items, and services necessary to accommodate 2 separate training events being conducted at the same time at the same facility. Dates: January 27-29, 2017.</p>
<p>Location Requirements:<br />These events must be conducted at a "get-away" location sufficiently removed from base to facilitate a "retreat-like setting" that is conducive to relationship building and resilience training. Location must not present concerns of safety, nor environmental stimuli such as large crowds, noise, nor any other factor that precludes the possibility of a low stress environment. The facility must meet all federal and state laws and regulations governing the health, welfare, and safety standards to be offered to these federal service members and their families.</p>
<p>The location must be between 1.0 and 2.5 hours' drive from 100 Nicholson Road, East Granby, CT as judged by Google Maps.</p>

<p>Conference space: Meeting room for 65 people with 8 tables seating 8 persons each.</p>
<p><br />2. Contractor's Manpower Reporting</p>
<p>The Contractor's Manpower Reporting Act requires federal contractors to report the number of employees and labor hours involved in federal government contracts such as this one. This process can take an administrative staff member a few hours to complete. This may be priced separately or included in the pricing of services listed above. For more information and for reporting, please visit: http://www.ecmra.mil/</p>
<p>3. Reservations for items NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS CONTRACT:</p>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons is seeking concerns having the ability for providing Residential Reentry Center (RRC) services (in-house RRC beds) and Home Confinement services (home confinement placements) for male and female Federal offenders held under the authority of United States Statutes located in the Kansas City, Missouri areas within one of the following counties: Clay, Jackson, or Platte, Missouri.
<p>Both the RRC services for in-house RRC beds and the Home Confinement services for home confinement placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, October, 2016". Home Confinement services (for home confinement placements) are specifically defined in chapter 10, programs, of the aforementioned SOW. Additional requirements for these services are referenced throughout the SOW as well.</p>
<p>This will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract for services with a one year base period, and four one-year options periods.<br />The RRC In-House requirement will consist of a 131 bed facility in which 119 beds will be designated for males and 12 beds designated for females.<br /><br />The Home Confinement requirement will consist of 66 placements to include both male and female. The Home Confinement Radius will be within 100 miles of the facility.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home confinement placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>RFP-200-1351-CS will be available on or about January 9, 2017, and it will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions. Future information about this acquisition will also be distributed through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The estimated closing date of RFP-200-1351-CS will be on or about&nbsp;March 10, 2017.<br />All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by this agency. No collect calls will be accepted. No telephone request or written requests for the solicitation will be accepted.</p>
<p>Faith-Based and Community Organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.</p>

<DESC>This project will replace Air Handling Units (AHU) AHU-6A and AHU-7A, which serve the UPS room in the mechanical wing. The existing ducts and chilled water piping will be modified to accommodate the new air handlers and to allow maintenance access. The heat load generated by the equipment in the room has changed since the HVAC system was designed and must be revised to meet the current demand. The new AHUs may require variable speed drives to manage the unusual heat load of the space. Low speed operation will allow for humidity control, and high speed operation will provide higher cooling capacity needed when the UPSs are put through their scheduled maintenance load tests.

The design of the water proofing system used to protect the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) equipment from potential water leaks will be evaluated.  The equipment curbs, insulation, and damaged rubber membrane will be replaced. Demolition activities will remove all previous hangers, supports, and brackets, along with abandoned pipes and conduits in the space. Lighting in the mechanical space will be relocated, to provide safe and effective work areas for maintenance operations and daily inspections.

<DESC>Title:  Remove current chain link fence and build mammalian pest-proof fence at the Honouliuli Refuge unit of the Pearl Harbor National Wildlife Refuge

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a requirement to remove current degraded chain link fencing surrounding the Honouliuli refuge unit and dispose off site and to build an approximately 3,500 foot long mammalian pest-proof fence which, upon completion, will be an effective barrier to the entrance of all non-flying mammalian pests.

Construction period is anticipated to be January 2017 through June 2018. Project is unrestricted and is open to any size business.  Applicable NAICS code is 238990. 

SITE VISIT: Already conducted.

QUESTIONS FROM SITE VISIT: Date for questions is already over. 

A complete description of the fence design can be found below in Fence Construction Specifications as follows:

LOCATION CONSIDERATIONS

The fence site at Honouliuli is located in the town of Ewa and is situated on Pearl Harbor   (see figure 1).  Access to the site will be through a locked gate on a dirt access road. This road is made of gravel, and dirt, and can become muddy and soft in places after heavy rain. 
 
The proposed project area is generally flat and has a mostly sandy substrate. The northern boundary of the refuge lies along the shore of Pearl Harbor and includes a strand of red mangrove forest.  This area will become more subject to inundation associated with sea level rise.  This shoreline area will not be fenced.  The fence will extend out into the water approximately 10 meters on each upland end of the fence.

The Honouliuli unit consists of two separate ponds.  The smaller Pond A on the west side is approximately 5.2 acres and the larger Pond B is approximately 14.1 acres. The predator- proof fence will follow the existing perimeter fence, except along the northern boundary.  

There is a ditch that extends inland approximately 1,128 feet from the Pearl Harbor shoreline into the refuge (see Fig. 2).  It is approximately 4 meters wide and usually contains water.  The Predator-proof fence will not affect this canal.  There are trees and shrubs growing along the current boundary fence.  Vegetation removal will be required including removal of all trees and shrubs within 4 meters of the outside of the fence.  

 FENCE CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS

The fence design, materials, and construction specifications are described in detail below. These are based on the specifications required to completely exclude the mammal species found at Honouliuli, as determined by extensive research in New Zealand and trials in Hawaii (Day and MacGibbon 2002, Burgett et al. 2007), and previous experience constructing predator fences in Hawaii (Young et al. 2012, Young et al. 2013).

Fence dimensions, angles, clearance, and abutments

1.	Height. The fence should stand no less than 1.9 meters high to prevent feral cats from jumping over it. This height is measured from a point one meter out from the base of the fence " representing the likely jumping position of a cat " vertically to the top of the hood. 
2.	Angles. No exterior corner should be sharper than 45 degrees off the line of the adjacent fence sections (see diagram below) to prevent animals gaining access to the top of the fence by jumping from one section to another. 
3.	The area immediately outside of the fence (i.e., the pest side) should be completely free of any objects, structures, or vegetation >30 cm in height within 4 meters of the fence to prevent animals from jumping to the top of the fence or over it.
4.	Abutting fences. Where another fence adjoins the pest proof fence on the outside (i.e. pest side), the pest fence must be 1.9 meters taller than the other fence to retain the required clearance. (For example, if an abutting fence stands 1.2 meters off the ground, the pest fence must be extended to a height of no less than 3.1 meters off the ground.
5.	Unmovable trees and structures. If any trees or other objects on the outside of the fence must remain within 4 meters of the fence, those trees and structures should be banded with materials that prevent pests from climbing them, and the banded trees should not be in contact or within 4 meters of other trees on the outside of the fence that are not also banded. 

Fence materials

All materials, including the mesh, hood, and screws and other hardware, will be made of stainless steel, except the fence posts, which will be made of wood treated against termites and rot. Wooden fence posts are recommended at this site because their larger diameter will provide a more secure footing in the sandy soil. Metal fence posts are much narrower and might shift in the sand more easily. All materials will be tested by an independent lab to verify that they meet the desired specifications.

1.	Posts. The fence posts will be made of treated wood and will be 2.7 meters long and ~12.7 cm (~5in) in diameter and full round in shape. Posts will be placed in holes 0.7 meters deep and spaced 2 m apart.  
2.	Braces. Stainless steel braces, or stays, will be placed on every fourth post over the entire length of the fence to provide increased strength against wind. All braces must be attached on the inside of the fence, so that animals cannot climb up them.
3.	Mesh and skirt. The face of the fence and the horizontal skirt extending out from the base of the fence will be made of marine-grade 316 stainless steel mesh. The mesh will consist of flexible rolls that are 2.3 m tall and up to 10 meters long, so that the face and mesh are seamless. The aperture dimension of the mesh will be no larger than 7 mm in order to exclude mice. The mesh will be attached to the posts and post framework using stainless steel hardware. 
4.	Hood. The hood will be made of 304 grade stainless steel, and will be provided in the shape outlined in Exhibit E with the exception of the length which will be 4.1m long sections (vs 3m outlined in Exhibit E). The hood will be attached with a stainless steel bracket to each post, and attached to the frame using stainless steel hardware. The smooth surface, slope, and shape of the hood prevent animals from gaining traction and climbing to the top of the fence. Please see Exhibit E for precise measurements of hood holes and dimensions (with the exception of the modified 4.1m length).
5.	Water culverts. One culvert are necessary at this site because there is little slope, the soil is sandy and very porous, and there is no surface slow of water.
6.	 Fasteners. The Contractor will provide all fasteners necessary to attach the fence components to each other, including solder for joining hood sections. All fasteners and solder must be stainless steel to avoid electrolysis.

    
Fence construction specifications

1.	The fence must be constructed in such a way that there are no gaps wider than 7 mm along more than one dimension between the inside and outside of the fence. This specification should be inspected in the following parts of the fence:
-	All joints between sections of the mesh forming the face of the fence.
-	The junction between the mesh and the hood at the top of the fence.
-	The joints between each hood section at each post and at each corner and bend in the fence.
2.	Skirt. The mesh skirt (the portion of the mesh that extends horizontally out from the base of the fence) should:
-	Extend at least 35 cm out from the fence base.
-	Be covered with soil to a depth of 10 cm (4 inches) so it is not visible (see Figure 2
-	Be secured to the ground with stakes or pegs in any sloped areas.
-	Not be scoured out or tunneled under in any way.
3.	All staples, rivets, screws, and pins should be tightly seated so that mesh or hood sections cannot flap to create gaps greater than 7mm; all fastening hardware must be of the same type of metal as the mesh.
4.	Hood attachment. The rivets or screws used to attach the hood to the brackets should be inserted from the underside, so that only a small nub, and not the head of the screw or rivet, is present on the top of the hood, in order to reduce traction available to animals that somehow reach the top of the hood.

Access gate. Gate providing access to the fenced area must:

1.	Be designed and attached to the body of the fence in a pest proof manner, i.e., with no gaps greater than 7mm (1/4 inch) along more than one dimension when the gate is closed and latched.
2.	Have either a mesh skirt or a solid concrete footing beneath the gate entrance that extends out from the gate by no less than 35 cm.
3.	Have a latch or other means by which the gate can be locked or rendered un-openable from the outside.

Earthworks 

1.	A fence platform consisting of a gentle mound (when viewed in cross-section) will be formed so that drainage water cannot pass through the line of the fence.
2.	The earthworks and substrate adjacent to the fence should not have any channels, tunnels, or gaps greater than 7 mm in more than one dimension that extend under the fence from the outside to the inside.
3.	The ground conditions adjacent to the fence should be such that there is no risk of slumping or erosion that may cause damage to the fence or compromise any of the standards listed above. 

Basis for award will be "Lowest-Priced, Technically- Acceptable."  The lowest priced offeror will receive the award if considered to be technically acceptable. If not considered technically acceptable, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated until the lowest priced offeror is identified that is considered technically acceptable to receive the award. To be considered technically acceptable, the offeror must submit the following information with their proposal for evaluation:

1.	Past Performance:  List past projects performed that are similar in nature to the Statement of Work with current points of contact and phone numbers (not-to-exceed three pages). The contractor is solely responsible for the accuracy of this information as the Government will not pursue incorrect contact data. 
2.	Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement (not-to-exceed 3 pages).  List experience in building predator proof fences, the locations and references for jobs completed. If no experience in building predator proof fences, then a description of experience building conservation fences in Hawaii along with three references (including contact information); and
3.	Price (no page limit): A price estimate that includes all costs associated with the items listed below; please break down costs into labor and materials categories: 

a)	Labor and machinery/tools required for construction of the 3,500 foot long Mammalian Pest Proof Fence at Honouliuli. Note that Davis-Bacon wages are required for this project.
b)	Stainless steel fasteners, solder and cement necessary for construction of (note that this is 50m longer than the fence length so that materials for repairs are left on. The cost of these materials should include shipping and any taxes, such as local US/Hawaiian taxes, employee/Contractor taxes, GET etc.).

<DESC><p>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an Integrated LCRD LEO (Low-Earth Orbit) User Modem and Amplifier (ILLUMA) for multiple mission applications associated with satellite free space optical communication. NASA's Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) will be an optical communications relay satellite that will be placed in Geosynchronous orbit (GEO) in the 2019 time frame. This GEO satellite will have the capability to receive an optical communications signal called the "forward link" from a transmitting terminal (i.e. from a ground station or a LEO satellite such as the ILLUMA) at a channel rate up to 2.88 Gbps and relay it to a receiving terminal. Initially the LCRD terminal will relay signals between two ground stations. Additional terminals in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) would greatly enhance the utility of the LCRD relay. The purpose of this procurement is to acquire a modem for use on LEO spacecraft that can communicate with the LCRD in GEO. <br /><br />The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>

<p><br />NIST does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice and otherwise pay for the information requested. No entitlement or payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by NIST will arise as a result of submission of responses to this Notice and NIST use of such information. NIST recognizes that proprietary components, interfaces and equipment, and clearly mark restricted or proprietary components, interfaces and equipment, and clearly mark restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. In the absence of such identification, NIST will assume to have unlimited rights to all technical data in the information paper.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br />The Heat Transfer and Alternative Energy Systems Group at NIST maintains the NIST500 mm and 1016 mm Guarded Hot Plate Facilities for the determination of steady-state thermal transmission properties of industrial insulation. A critical mission of these facilities is the development and characterization of thermal insulation reference materials. Thermal insulation reference materials are utilized by NIST customers for the calibration and validation of their thermal conductivity instruments. NIST issues thermal insulation Standard Reference Materials to the public through the NIST Office of Reference Materials.</p>
<p>Standard Reference Material 1450e, Fibrous Glass Board, is projected to be out of stock due to above average annual sales. A replacement batch, designated as 1450e, is now required. Procurement of the replacement batch is to be accomplished in two phases. NIST intends to analyze the responses submitted to this notice to identify vendors that can provide samples that meet NIST's criteria. In Phase I, NIST intends to procure a sample lot of 10 units from multiple vendors whose responses show that they can provide samples that meet NIST's criteria. The samples will be tested and analyzed by NIST using the factors established below. NIST intends to use the results of the testing of the aforementioned samples to help determine the acquisition strategy for the future Phase II procurement of approximately 450 units.</p>
<p>Draft Requirement:</p>
<p>NIST is seeking information on contractors who are capable of providing materials that meet the requirements below:</p>
<p>Material: The material is molded fibrous glass board, a specialty thermal insulation product that is manufactured by molding uncured rolls of fibrous-glass blanket under heat and pressure to provide a dense board at a specified thickness.

<p>Full Term: 15<br />Firm Term: 10<br />Option Term: 0</p>
Space must be located in a quality building in a prime commercial office district with attractive, prestigious,&nbsp;professional surroundings with a prevalence of modern design and/or tasteful rehabilitation in modern use. Multi-use flex space and space in light industrial park settings will not be considered to meet these standards. Streets and public sidewalks must be well maintained.
<p>To allow for visibility to the public, the government office space shall be located not more than the equivalent of two city blocks from a primary or secondary street serving the office. The lessor shall provide acceptable signage from the primary or secondary street at no separate cost. The route from the primary or secondary street shall be direct. Locations which have obscure, difficult access or which require multiple turns<br />shall not be considered.</p>
<p>The location should not be located within the immediate&nbsp;vicinity of railroad tracks. Sites which are located directly on or near a roadway which presents a hazard to our customers will not be considered.<br /><br />Determinations of hazardous access will be determined by the Government. Examples of such sites include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Sites located directly on a highway or six lane&nbsp;thoroughfare if:<br />&bull; Ease of access to and availability of public transportation and parking for visitors and employees.<br />&bull; Sites which are located directly on a highway or six lane thoroughfare shall not be considered in the following<br />instances:<br />o If the two directions of traffic are separated by a&nbsp;physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within one block, or&#894;<br />o If the access is directly from the highway, unless there&nbsp;is a traffic control device within two blocks or equivalent from the proposed office space.<br />o There are no pedestrian sidewalks that allow easy&nbsp;access to and from the office.</p>
<p>Access from outside to agency space within the building must provide access for wheelchair traffic. The primary entrance must be accessible for all persons with special needs. Street level contiguous (same floor) space is preferred. Contiguous upper floor space on one floor that meets the Government lease criteria and has handicapped accessible elevator service to the government office floor is an acceptable alternative. We prefer that the storage and/or Interactive Video Tele-training (IVT) rooms be located contiguous with the main office space. However, these rooms only, and their associated square footage, may be separated from the main office area by a public corridor. Elevator service shall consist of a minimum of&nbsp;two accessible elevators that serve the floor proposed for the government. One of the accessible elevators may serve as a freight elevator.</p>
<p>It is a requirement that overall dimensions of the space shall have a maximum length to width ratio of 2 to 1. Preference will be given to blocks of space that allow maximum flexibility for furniture placement, i.e., few or no columns or other obstructions, rectangular in shape, no curves or offsets, and with large open areas. Space requiring ramps inside the office will not be acceptable. Columns must be at least 20 feet from any interior wall and from each other (clear distance) and be no more than 2 feet square.</p>
<p>The Government requires sufficient general parking as specified by local code requirements. The Government requests that, due to budgetary costs, the cost of this parking be included as part of the rental consideration. In some instances, the Government will request parking for carpools, disabled employees, and in and out parking for employee use and for program purposes.</p>
<p>The parking-to-square-foot ratio available on site shall at least meet current local code requirements, or, in absence of a local code requirement, on site parking shall be available at a ratio of 1 space for every 200 RSF of Government demised area.</p>
<p>When the Government is the only building tenant and/or the only tenant utilizing the parking lot, additional accessible parking spaces for the disabled beyond those otherwise required or existing, (whichever is greater) shall be provided based on the size of the office. This shall be in addition to any reserved parking required by the Government for employees with disabilities.</p>
<p>When the government is to be located in a multi tenant&nbsp;building in a downtown location, parking for the disabled shall be provided:<br /><br />(1) In an adjoining parking lot or garage with a fully accessible route to the office. Quantity shall be five spaces in addition to existing disabled parking provided or in addition to disabled spaces required by code, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>(2) Along city streets, by having the city provide a minimum number of disabled spaces, in addition to any existing or otherwise planned or required spaces within 1/2 block from the accessible entrance (see schedule above). Written assurance by the city shall be requested indicating that the spaces shall be restricted for usage by the disabled during the tenancy of the Government.</p>
<p>When public transportation is available, passenger stops must be within two blocks of the space. In suburban areas, in small communities and in areas of major cities where adequate public transportation and on site parking are not available, secure vehicle parking facilities MUST be available at reasonable commercial rates for visitors and employees within a two block radius of the space. Secure parking is defined as parking that meets Federal Protective Service guidelines and should be resolved before any lease is signed. "Reasonable Rates" will be determined by local pricing levels.</p>
<p>In those locations where on site parking is not available parking for the disabled must be located within the same&nbsp;block.</p>
<p>Restricted or metered parking of one hour or less within the two block area of the space does not meet parking&nbsp;requirements. This is because many Government contacts with the public cannot be completed within one hour.</p>

Although this solicitation is not limited to firms located within a 350 mile radius of the Colmery-O Neil VA Medical Center, Topeka, Kansas, the evaluation factor for Location of Design Firm will consider the firm s location and identified subcontractors so that those firms within the radius of 350 miles will be considered more favorably.  Firms with contractor and subcontractor employees identified in the SF 330 that will come from beyond that radius will result in the lower evaluated score for that factor.
