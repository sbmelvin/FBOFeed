Complete assessment for each item provided and report findings within 10 working days. Travel will be required to discuss and present findings. Review inspection limits for accuracy, and recommend engineering solution. Work with Air Force Technical Content Managers to make correction to the identified discrepancies. A basic contract period and four option years are required to provide seamless support for the IETMS Block Cycle Update reviews.</p>
<p>If not approved, could affect a safety of flight if limits and critical rotating parts technical changes are not correct. A normal block cycle update has from 200 to 300 changes incorporated and the BCU need to be reviewed for accuracy. These reviews need to be accomplished in a 10 to 15 day period on a quarterly basis before being released to the customers. A contractor that is familiar with the Interactive Electronic Technical Manual and the technical content speeds this process for getting changes to the customers in minimum time.</p>

<DESC>Description: Sources Sought Notice-Market Research.<BR><BR>This is not a solicitation for bids/proposals, but a Request for Information to conduct market re-search IAW FAR Part 10.  The Product Manager, Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS) proposes to acquire inside-the-wire and outside-the-wire Force Protection and early warning systems.  The intended scope is for a single, all-inclusive domain addressing the full range of requirements that fall within this lead descriptor.  <BR><BR>Statement of Objectives<BR>Integrated Base Defense Omnibus<BR>1.  Background.<BR><BR>The United States Army has an ongoing requirement to provide Integrated Base Defense (IBD) Force Protection capabilities at temporary and permanent, nuclear and non-nuclear at CONUS and OCONUS sites around the world. The ultimate goal is to provide forces with the capability to See First, Understand First, and Act First.  Keys to achieving this goal are the application of capabilities that enhance security, surveillance and reconnaissance, resulting in the integration of security systems into an IBD common architecture configured to provide timely detection and quantification of potential threats, allowing the rapid application of appropriate, effective response to mitigate or eliminate verified threats. <BR><BR>To meet the growing demand and complexity of the IBD requirement, the Army will make multiple awards under this Request for Proposal (RFP).  Awards may be made to up to 20-30 Large and Small businesses awards in the Full and Open Lot, and 10-15 awards in the Partial Small Business Set-Aside Lot.  The multiple contracts provide a rapid, flexible methodology to access the range and depth of capabilities necessary to protect Soldiers and other personnel around the globe. <BR><BR>These contracts will provide access to force protection capabilities with modular systems, equipment, and components that can be used as stand-alone or integrated systems to protect a range of installation sizes from small units and assets to large base-wide mission areas. IBD system components will consist of Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) and Non-Development Items (NDI).  Additionally the Government will procurement of the products will include a sustainment warranty for installed and deployed IBD systems.  The sustainment warranty will include training and initial sustainment.  <BR><BR>Site tailored requirements will be provided in Delivery Orders (DO) that will include Site Survey Packages. Performance of multiple DOs may overlap, requiring concurrent installation and warranty support sat many installations in different locations including quick reaction support to temporary and permanent fixed site deployments around the world, especially during Overseas Contingency Operations. <BR><BR>The intent of this acquisition is to provide personnel with integrated security systems significantly reduce the time required to detect, assess, and neutralize or mitigate anticipated threats while re-ducing manpower levels (or staffing requirements) wherever possible.  IBD provides a line of defense for all critical assets (fixed, temporary or mobile) through electronic detection; alarm assessment; access control; communications; and command, control, and display capabilities.<BR><BR>2.  Program Objectives.<BR><BR>The mission of the Product Manager Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS) is to acquire physical security systems, sensors, and related hardware to provide surveillance, security and safety for Warfighters and other personnel at military installations worldwide including Forward Operating Bases (FOB). Integral to the success of this mission is the ability to compete requirements among qualified contractors in an efficient and timely manner.  Acquisition Reform initiatives have made available avenues intended to increase the efficiency and timeliness of the acquisition process.  One of the central Acquisition Reform initiatives is the creation of Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts that allow competition of individual DOs.  PM-FPSs objective is to establish long-term, competitively awarded, contract vehicles which include a pre-qualified group of contractors to compete for delivery orders under this IDIQ contract.  PM-FPSs intent is to allow each selected contractor a fair opportunity to be considered for all subsequent DO level requirements within the contracts statement of objectives, supporting the range and depth of the required capabilities.   <BR>Companies awarded contracts must possess management capability to provide materiel solutions relevant to the mission of PM-FPS with specific expertise in the systems, equipment and compo-nents required under the contracts at the DO level.  The Government intends to procure products that have been tested and fielded under previous US Government contracts.  Further, these companies must be able to form and credibly manage teams prior to contract award, or on a DO basis. This statement of objectives includes the assembly; integration; delivery; testing; fielding; training; and initial sustainment of Force Protection systems and equipment including the hardware/software required for effective force protection.  <BR>3.  Contract Objectives. <BR><BR>The mission of PM-FPS is to acquire inside-the-wire and outside-the-wire Force Protection and early warning systems.  The intended objective is for a single, all-inclusive domain addressing the full range of requirements that fall within this lead descriptor.  Integral to the success of this mission is the ability to compete requirements amongst qualified contractors in the most efficient and timely manner possible.  PM-FPS objective is to establish a long-term, competitively awarded, IDIQ contract vehicle with a select group of highly qualified contractors.  PM-FPS intent is to then allow each selected contractor a fair opportunity to be considered for all subsequent DO level re-quirements within the statement of objectives, supporting the breadth and depth of the applicable Warfighter Force Protection requirements.  US agencies and NATO partners may procure the re-quirements and have them delivered to CONUS and/or OCONUS sites. <BR>A company must (as a Prime contractor) be able to provide stand alone or integrated solutions with proven capabilities to support the PM-FPS mission.  Further, these companies must be able to form and effectively manage teams, under a DO, capable of providing innovative and creative solutions, potentially across the breadth and depth of the PM-FPS mission area.  This objectives include:    <BR><BR>"	Intrusion Detection capabilities to scan and / or determine the safety risk of people and vehicles, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) materials.  The types of systems capable of providing the information needed to make safety determinations include but are not limited to, Ground Surveillance Radar, Unattended Ground Systems, Cameras and Imagers, and Subterranean / Subsurface remotely controlled scanners, biometric and CBRN sensors.  Mountings include, but are not limited to, surface and sub-surface; air vehicle; water vehicle; ground vehicle; or tower placements.  <BR><BR><BR>"	Explosive Materials detection capabilities that provide remote non-intrusive inspections, close up inspections using hand held detectors, swipe and swab vapor and particle detectors and other comparable equipment.  <BR><BR>"	Entry Denial capabilities including Active-Barriers-Popup-Drop Down, High Frequency Sound emission, Passive Bollards, Grab Systems, and personnel identification <BR><BR>"	Acoustic Hailing Devices capabilities for notification<BR><BR>"	Autonomous Unmanned Systems with capabilities to detect, assess, and respond.  Examples of the types of systems providing these capabilities include Unmanned Air Vehicles, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, and Remotely Operated Weapons<BR><BR>"	Ancillary capabilities to be included with the delivered systems and equipment shipments, i.e., installation tools, test equipment, packaging.<BR>4.  Performance Objectives<BR><BR>Equipment functions may include, but are not limited to command and control, mission planning, and product integration support.<BR><BR>System, equipment and component performance minimums include two overarching objectives:  <BR> <BR>"	Interface capabilities that meet the applicable Security Equipment Integration Working Group (SEIWG) standards contained in Appendix A (Interface Specifications for the DoD Base and Installation Security Systems (BISS), SEIWG 005B of 31 March 2005) and Appendix B (SEIWG Interface Control Document SEIWG ICD-0100XML Information Exchange of 27 October 2006)<BR><BR>"	Performance capabilities that meet or exceed the IBD Omnibus Contract System and Equip-ment Performance Criteria. <BR><BR>IBD capabilities are the underpinning of Integrated, Base, Unit and Installation Protection whose capabilities include detect, assess, warn, defend, and recover.<BR><BR>"	Detect. The ability to collect timely and accurate data/information about adversary capabilities.  <BR>"	Assess.  The capability to develop an understanding of the situation and accurately identify ad-versary capabilities that can be used against friendly personnel, physical assets, and information and precisely derive adversary courses of action, planned or employed, with the intent to destroy, or disrupt, operational readiness.  Additionally, begin development of a course (or courses) of action, and orders for execution.  <BR>"	Warn.  The development of a course (s) of action, and orders for execution that will allow re-sponse to actionable intelligence and information.  <BR>"	Defend.  The ability to execute a selected course of action to resist hostile actions directed against friendly personnel, physical assets, and information in order to preserve operational capabilities.  Once a commander makes a decision, the commander puts the decision into action or instructs others to act in support of the chosen course of action.  <BR>"	Recover.  Actions taken during, or after a hostile attack to restore friendly personnel, physical assets, and information to full operational readiness.  <BR><BR>5.  Management Objectives.<BR><BR>The NAICS Code for this effort is 423610 Security Systems Merchant Wholesalers (Size standard is 100 employees).  The planned acquisition approach is to award between 20-30 contracts to Large and Small businesses in the Full and Open Lot,  and 10-15 contracts in the Partial Small Business Set-Aside Lot to companies who provide best value with demonstrated performance and experience to provide stand-alone systems and integrated system-solutions that meet the required capabilities.  However, the Government reserves the right to award more or less awards in each Lot dependent upon the quality of the proposals in response to the Request for Proposal for this effort.  Once the contracts are awarded, the Government will compete delivery orders among the appropriate Lot, but reserves the right to make awards on an Exception to Fair Opportunity basis due to Government requirements.  The IDIQ contracts are available to US agencies and NATO partners, which may centrally procure Delivery Orders through RDECOM to fulfill their requirements with delivery to CONUS and/or OCONUS sites.   The total funding and contract ceiling is estimated at $997M for this effort.  <BR><BR>Included in the solicitation is a partial small business set-aside competition language IAW FAR Clause 52.219-7 Notice of Partial Small Business Set-Aside that will allow a number of awards to be made to small businesses including Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned & 8a companies contingent upon receipt of acceptable proposals from responsible and qualified Small Business Offerors.  As such, contracts to be awarded under this solicitation will be made in two 2 separate Lots - 1 Full & Open Lot and 2 Small Business Set-Aside Lot. The small business set-aside award decision will be made after consideration of all proposals received from both large and small business for award in the Full & Open Lot.  After consideration of all proposals in the Full & Open Lot, the Government will then consider ONLY those proposals from Small Business Offerors for award un-der the Small Business Set-Aside Lot.  It is possible that a small business may be selected for award in both Lots.  In such case, the small business will be awarded a contract in the Full & Open Lot and a separate contract in the Small Business Set-Aside Lot. Small Business Offerors that receive an award on a small business set-aside basis will be subject to FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations in Subcontracting over the life of the contract.  Small Business Offerors that receive an award in the Full & Open Lot will not be subject to this clause for orders issued under this Lot.<BR><BR>Scheduled for contract award in the third quarter FY11, this acquisition will result in multiple com-petitively awarded contracts to a cadre of best qualified contractors possessing the business prac-tices and capability to provide the required products and ancillary services required for fielding, training and initially sustaining the force protection products.  The proposed approach is to award multiple, five-year, Firm Fixed Price FFP IDIQ contracts with a thirty six -month base period and one twenty four month option.  Delivery orders will be competed among the selected contractors within an appropriate Lot over the period of performance of the contracts based on Government requirements and funding availability.  For each capability, the Government plans to procure a sustainment warranty which includes New Equipment Training NET, sustainment training and scheduled and unscheduled sustainment maintenance.  <BR><BR>The Government intends to award contracts to the Offerors whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Governments estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.<BR><BR>The objective of the contracts is to ensure rapid, cost effective and streamlined contracting for delivery of high quality products at fair and reasonable prices.  PM-FPS desires to minimize pre-award acquisition costs at both the IDIQ and DO levels for the Government and industry.  PM-FPS intends to achieve this with an inclusive, broadbase of Prime contractor teams and small businesses.  This approach provides PM-FPS and its customers with direct access to a broad array of potential providers.  The emphasis on selecting capable large business, prime contractor teams and small businesses at the IDIQ contract level allows access to numerous small businesses which pos-sess innovative, creative and often niche solutions that might otherwise be precluded from competing if relegated to a subcontractor role.<BR><BR>6. Definitions.<BR><BR>"	Integrated Base Defense (IBD) is the integrated application of offensive and defensive actions, both active and passive, taken across the ground dimension of the Force Protection battle space to achieve local and area dominance.<BR><BR>"	Force Protection Battle space.

Contract clauses will include: FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive OrdersCommercial Items (Alternate II  May 2009), 52.203-15 Whistleblower Protections Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Mar 2009), 52.204-11 American Recovery and Reinvestment ActReporting Requirements (Mar 2009), and 52.214-26 Audit and RecordsSealed Bidding (Mar 2009).<BR><BR>The awardee must also submit a copy of all invoices to the Contracting Officer and/or Contract Specialist named on page 1 of the contract, for recording purposes. Failure to furnish a copy of all invoices accordingly may result in denied invoice approval and/or payment.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of HP servers. This acquisition is to extend the Enterprise Server Operations Center (ESOC) Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to ESOC West.  The infrastructure being implemented at ESOC West is a replication of the existing infrastructure currently in place at the ESOC East.This establishment of ESOC West is a key component of the Data Center Consolidation program.  ESOC West will be one of two production data centers that will house all of the Departments production servers up to the Secret classification level.  This acquisition will provide backup servers for the virtual infrastructure to host those production applications.  The servers will serve as backups to the blade servers that function as the primary support of the virtual infrastructure.. 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Paragraph (c) provides for use of a brand name procurement.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as key components of the ESOC West IT infrastructure.  This purchase is one of several to replicate the Departments existing ESOC East IT infrastructure.  Question 3 above addresses the historical background of this issue more fully.The requirement will be completed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Alternative Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Public Meeting

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting a review of alternative positioning, navigation, and timing (APNT) capabilities that support communication, navigation, and surveillance applications for aviation within the U.S. in the event of a loss of Global Navigation Satellite Services (GNSS).  The FAA currently provides APNT services through a variety of non-GNSS legacy navigation systems including Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR), Instrument Landing System (ILS) and radar surveillance.
The FAA is considering the future need for APNT services to ensure that operations are appropriately supported, consistent with the evolution to the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  NextGen will require an increased level of minimum APNT performance from what legacy systems currently provide.  Therefore, the FAA is collecting information regarding research, development and potential implementation of systems, avionics, processes, and procedures that minimize the impact to system capacity and efficiency during periods of GNSS interference.
In order to exchange information with the aviation industry, the FAA will hold a public meeting on August 10, 11, and 12 in Stanford, CA.  The purpose of the meeting is to 1) share the current FAA perspective on future APNT requirements and 2) solicit input from the community on the perceived requirements and potential APNT solutions that support NextGen.  The tentative agenda items include:
1.	FAA presentations on anticipated APNT assumptions and requirements2.	Airspace user presentations on operator requirements (airline, business aviation, general aviation)3.	Avionics manufacturers' presentations on capabilities that may be available in support of NextGen.4.	Ground infrastructure manufacturers' presentations on systems and design that can support APNT.
Because seating is limited, interested parties should RSVP to the individuals listed below.  Additional information including a detailed agenda and meeting logistics will be provided to those responding to this announcement. 
At the meeting, airspace users are encouraged to present their envisioned requirements for APNT in NextGen.  Participants representing the manufacturing industry are encouraged to present concepts and technical data that explain how the FAA can provide APNT services that affordably minimize the impact of a localized GNSS interference event.  Presentations should specifically address the issues surrounding the operational need to continue navigation and surveillance during a GNSS interference event.  If alternative implementations are envisioned for different classes of aircraft/users, these alternatives should be clearly described.  
A limited number of 30-minute closed-door sessions between manufacturers and the FAA's APNT team will be available for the purpose of exchanging proprietary information.  Manufacturers interested in setting up a session should make their request at the time of the RSVP.  Interested parties are also invited to submit a summary of their planned presentation to the FAA in the form of a report (via email) by July 30, 2010.  Please limit the summary to five pages.  Any and all information deemed proprietary should be clearly marked on each page.  
In order to ensure that you receive the most up-to-date information please RSVP both Mitch Narins [mitchell.narins@faa.gov - (202) 493-4336] and Randy Kenagy [randy.kenagy@avmgt.com - (703) 518-9923].

The ultimate contract award will be based on a "Best Value Continuum". The project consists of the rehabilitation of the lighthouse/ keeper's house located on Matinicus Rock Island, approximately 27 miles off the coast of Rockland, ME. The entire complex of structures on the island are listed on the National Register of Historic Places; therefore, the Secretary of Interior Standards for Historic Preservation shall be followed. The goal of this project is to rehabilitate and stabilize the Lighthouse/ Keeper's House. The work shall include demolition, re-pointing existing stone masonry and brickwork, rough and finished carpentry, replacement of the existing roof, replacement of doors and windows, exterior and interior finishes and painting,  replacement of lighthouse glazing and railing and all electrical work as required to provide a weather tight, complete and operational facility. Access to the site will be by boat or helicopter and will be weather dependant. Access to the site will be based upon such factors as the tides, wind direction and velocity, wave action and height and the time of year. Mobilizing and demobilizing to and from the site will present challenges, coordination, scheduling and safety issues not typically found in general construction projects. The Contractor will be responsible for bringing and off-loading all supplies and materials to the island and the removal and disposal of all demolition materials and debris off the island. The Contractor will be required to bring generators for electrical power and water to complete the work.  Based upon biological restrictions on the island the work shall not start until on or about August 15, 2010. The weather deteriorates significantly as we move into the late fall. The Contractor's workforce may stay on the island while the work is underway. The estimated magnitude of construction for this project is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The NAICS is 238390.  This procurement is unrestricted.  As part of the first step, which is the technical evaluation process, interested firms shall submit, in writing, their qualifications based on listed requirements below. Those determined qualified will be asked to submit a cost proposal (step two) in accordance with FAR 15.203.  Interested firms shall present a minimum of five (5) restoration projects undertaken within the last ten years.  The following information shall be provided for each of these projects: 1) Project name; 2)  Original budget; 3)  Change orders; 4) Summary of work; 5) Date of completion; and, 6) Client name, address and phone number.  Qualification factors used for the evaluation of firms shall be: 1)  Past performance (40%); 2) Multi-discipline experience in working similiar projects,with an emphasis on rehab of historical structures, including Lighthouses (25%); 3)  Ability to provide projects on time and within budget.

<a href="mailto:mike.v.brown@us.army.mil">USPFO for Pennsylvania</a>
<DESC>This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.  POINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS MR. MICHAEL V. BROWN.  SUBMIT QUESTIONS VIA E-MAIL TO:  mike.v.brown@us.army.mil. The NAICS code is 541330 Engineering Services.  The size standard is $4.5 Million.  This action is being undertaken in accordance with the Architectural & Engineering provisions of FAR Part 36 and DFARS Part 236.  This announcement is being issued on an unrestricted basis and is for the selection of Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Firms for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Air National Guard / Pennsylvania Army National Guard).  Contracting Officers outside of the United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) for Pennsylvania may issue Delivery Orders for A-E Services to support other State and Federal Agencies throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Firms must be capable of concurrently responding to and working on multiple projects.  Selection of Firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services, as more fully set forth in the selection criteria.  All Firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR Part 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest; and FAR 36.209  Construction contracts with architect-engineer firms.  Large Firms, if selected, will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS subpart 219.7 as part of any Request for Proposal package.  The subcontracting plan is NOT required with the Firms SF 330.<BR><BR>SCOPE OF SERVICES:  The United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) for Pennsylvania intends to award one or more (multiple awards may be made) Firm Fixed-Price performance based Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Air National Guard / Pennsylvania Army National Guard).  Each A-E IDIQ contract will be established for a base period of one (1) year with options exercisable for four (4) successive one (1) year option periods.  A contract minimum of $1,000 and a cumulative $10 Million ceiling will apply for the duration of each contract with no limit on individual delivery order amounts.  Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Orders are anticipated to be awarded against the A-E IDIQ contracts.  Contracting Officers outside of the USPFO for Pennsylvania will be able to issue Delivery Orders for A-E Services to support National Guard and other State and Federal Agencies throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  This announcement may result in the award of four (4) contracts to provide services to four (4) primary locations:  (LOCATION 1 - 171st ARW, Pittsburgh IAP; LOCATION 2 - 193rd SOW, Harrisburg IAP; LOCATION 3 - 111th FW, Willow Grove ARS; and LOCATION 4 - PAARNG, Fort Indiantown Gap; in addition to supporting locations/activities on a statewide basis.  Interested Firms must indicate the Location(s) for which they are submitting.  Since proximity of a Firms office for its project team and its knowledge of the locality as it pertains to design and construction methods of military projects in the geographic area where anticipated work will be accomplished is an evaluation factor, interested Firms submitting for more than one Location are encouraged to make multiple submissions with the Firms office location and key project team tailored to each Location.  The A-E IDIQ contracts that are anticipated to be awarded will each be for an initial base year period with four (4) one year option periods.  Individual Delivery Orders anticipated to be issued under the A-E IDIQ contract may include Delivery Orders under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Firms are advised that under such circumstances RECOVERY Act reporting requirements and contract clauses will be applicable to the Delivery Orders. The Architectural and Engineering Services for which Delivery Orders may be issued may include: a). Design of new facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; b). Rehabilitation of existing facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; c). Design of projects on Army or Air Force installations; d). Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria; e). Sustainable design utilizing LEED rating tools; f). Preparation of the development of the technical information for design-build Request for Proposals; g).  Development of construction cost estimates and schedules; h). Design of Demolition; i). Comprehensive planning that is related to future construction requirements on military installations; and j) Construction phase services including commissioning, shop drawing review and preparation of O&M manuals.  <BR><BR>EVALUATION:  The Governments selection of the best value contractor(s) is based upon an integrated assessment of the below factors / selection criteria in descending order of importance (unless otherwise stated) to determine the most highly qualified firm(s).  Each factor will be assigned a rating from Exceptional to Unacceptable, based on the risk to the government that the firm will successfully perform the factor being evaluated.  An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission.  Factors listed will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows:  SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT  meaning that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor; MORE IMPORTANT  meaning that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater; EQUAL  meaning that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor.  FACTOR 1 - Personnel (Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services)  evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the project team.  Firms should provide information for one to three individuals from each design discipline that is anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the project team.  The key positions should include:  Project Managers; Quality Assurance Managers; Architects; Structural Engineers; Civil Engineers; Mechanical Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Fire Protection Engineers; Geotechnical Engineers; Environmental Engineers; and Land Surveyors.  Firms may provide information on other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in the SCOPE OF SERVICES.  FACTOR 2 - Specialized Experience and Technical Competence  evaluates the experience of the Firm and project team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for the AE IDIQ Contract(s).  FACTOR 3 - Past Performance (previous 5 years)  evaluates the Firms performance on contracts with Government Agencies and Private Industry in terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules.  FACTOR 4  Work Management (capability to accomplish work in the required time)  evaluates the ability of the Firm to, given its current projected workload and the availability of key personnel, to accomplish a project(s) within required time periods.  FACTOR 5  Firm Location & Locality Knowledge (Location of project office in general geographical proximity to one of the following:  (a) LOCATION 1 - 171st ARW, Pittsburgh IAP, (b) LOCATION 2 - 193rd SOW, Harrisburg IAP, (c) LOCATION 3 - 111th FW, Willow Grove ARS, or (d) LOCATION 4 - PAARNG, Fort Indiantown Gap; and knowledge of the identified locality)  evaluates both the distance of the Firms project office from the LOCATION and the extent of the Firms knowledge of the LOCATION and knowledge/experience concerning state, county and local requirements for projects of the types anticipated for the A-E IDIQ Contract(s).  FACTOR 6 - Volume of Department of Defense (DoD) Awards (during the preceding twelve (12) months)  in the interest of equitable distribution of work, evaluates the volume of DoD work awarded during the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this announcement.  FACTOR 7  Small Business Participation  evaluates the degree to which a Firm identifies and commits to the use of small business concerns as prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner.  FACTORS 1 & 2 are each weighted EQUAL and are each, individually, MORE IMPORTANT than FACTOR 3, 4 & 5 which are each weighted EQUAL.  FACTORS 1 & 2 are also SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT than FACTORS 6 & 7 which are weighted EQUAL and which will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are otherwise essentially technically equal.  Relative to FACTOR 5  Location & Locality Knowledge, it is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office.  The Source Selection will consider the performance risk associated when a firms project team(s) is not co-located in the same office.<BR>  <BR>SUBMISSION FORMAT:  Three (3) completed and bound paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format on CD are required for each submission.  A separate response (SF 330) MUST be submitted for each LOCATION for which the submitting Firm wants to be considered AND clearly identify the LOCATION.  Submitting firms are to include the DUNS number along with the name of the firm in Block 5 of the SF 330, Part I, Section B.  A firm located within the United States may obtain a DUNS number by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://www.dnb.com/us/.  If a submitting Firm is located outside the United States, the local Dun and Bradstreet office should be contacted.  Relative to all submittals, FONT SIZE shall be at least 10 pitch or larger.  Except as otherwise indicated, pages shall be 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches.  Where page limits are indicated for Parts/Sections of the SF 330, excess pages will not be read or considered.  Each side of a sheet of paper shall be counted as a single page.  Blank sheets or tabs separating the sections within the SF 330 will not count toward any page limitation.  The Organizational Chart required in Section D and the Matrix required as Section G, may be presented on sheets up to 11 inches by 17 inches.  If an 11 inch by 17 inch sheet is used it shall be neatly folded to 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches and bound in the SF 330 at the proper location.  All key personnel for whom resumes are provided shall be shown on the organizational chart in Section D.  Resumes in Section E shall not exceed two (2) pages each.  Multiple Resumes may be reflected on a single page.  Resumes shall be provided for the qualified professional personnel indicated in FACTOR 1, above.   Professional licenses, registrations, and/or certifications shall be specifically identified on resumes and the failure to indentify a license, registration and/or certification will result in a presumption that none exists for the individual for whom the Resume is offered.  A maximum of Ten (10) projects including the prime and consultants will be reviewed in Section F.  No more than one (1) page should be used for each project.  Multiple projects may be reflected on a single page.  When listing projects in Section F, an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) with multiple Task Orders as examples is not considered a project.  Multiple task orders that are associated with a single project may be used and will be considered a single project; however, listing a single contract with task orders that may be unrelated is not considered a single project.  A task order executed under an IDC contract is a project.  In Block G-26, along with the name, include the firm with which the person is associated.  Section H shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages.  Indication of favorable performance ratings, awards, and repeat clientele in Section H is recommended.

<DESC>This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award any contracts now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this pre solicitation notice is to advertise that the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is contracting to renovate Building 3 at the NIST Boulder Campus in Boulder, Colorado. The Government intends to solicit this acquisition as a 100% small business set aside. All small businesses or small business concerns (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and VOSB and SDVOSB) are encouraged to propose on this project. The main requirements are assigned a NAICS code of 236220. with a small business size standard for such requirements of $33.5M. It is important to note that in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting - the prime contractor is required to perform at least 15% of the labor with their own employees for general construction and at least 25% of the labor with their own employees for special trade construction. For further information on the requirements for general construction and/or special trade construction, please visit the following web sites:
<p>http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/print.pl/oes/2001/oesi2_17.htm</p>
<p>http://www.census.gov/epcd/naics/NDEF235.HTM</p>
<p><br />Building 3 was constructed in the 1950s for hydrogen research and is a cast in place reinforced concrete and masonry structure with structural steel roof trusses. A major renovation effort shall be undertaken to transform the majority of the building space to accommodate the Fabrication Shop. The total renovated space is approximately 12000 SF [square feet]. All but 1300 SF are located at grade level.</p>
<p>As such, the project to renovate Building 3 shall include all of the following items. New electrical service and distribution, and a new building HVAC system will be installed (chilled water, steam and condensate return provided by the Central Utility Plant). Demolition of the residual equipment left from the hydrogen research as well as demolition of existing electrical service and old HVAC equipment is required. Also, some scientific research was conducted and it will be necessary to perform laboratory decommissioning on those spaces before renovation. The project will also address remediation of asbestos containing material as well as lead paint issues that are present in an aged building undergoing renovation. NIST will identify the presence of all hazardous materials in the project documentation. Architectural renovation will include floor upgrades, window replacement, painting, new suspended ceiling, restroom, office and break room remodeling, and ADA upgrades. Structural upgrades will include refurbishment of existing monorail system, enlargement of openings in structural walls, trench covers, and filling of pits and trenches. A precision measurement laboratory exists in Building 1 Wing 3 and it will be dismantled and moved to its new location in the Building 3 Instrument Fabrication Shop. Other ancillary functions such as the metal cleaning, forklift charging area, and parts washing room will accompany the move to Building 3. The Fabrication shop equipment will be prepared for movement, relocated, and set up to be functional in the renovated spaces in Building 3. One space in Building 3 occupied by the Flow Loop equipment shall remain functional during renovation and will require temporary lighting, heating, and power.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be released on or about July 7, 2010, with a proposal due date approximately thirty (30) days thereafter, and an award anticipated for August, 2010. The estimated price range of this project is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. A pre-proposal conference has been scheduled for Wednesday, July 21, 2010 from 10:00am - 12:00pm at the Auditorium of the NIST Boulder Campus, located at 325 Broadway in Boulder, Colorado. Information regarding the conference will be contained in the solicitation posting. Completion time for this project is currently projected to be two hundred and ten (210) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>Source selection will be made using lowest price technically acceptable source selection process (FAR 15.101-2). The government will not pay for any information solicited. Offers that do not meet all the requirements technically or price reasonableness will not be considered. All offerors who do not meet the minimum requirements will be notified as soon as they have been determined not to be in consideration any longer. Any late proposal received is subject to FAR 52.214-7 Late submissions, Modifications, and withdrawals of Bids (NOV 1999).</p>
<p>THE TECHNICAL DATA, SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS, WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD ON FED BIZ OPPS (WWW.FBO.GOV) WITH THE SOLICITATION ON OR ABOUT JULY 7, 2010.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY- The funding for this requirement will be made available under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) and all qualification criteria that arise from the use of ARRA funding apply to this requirement. This requirement is a partial small business set-aside. <br />
<p><br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure, as part of its "Medical Advanced Research Projects Initiative" feasibility or "proof of concept" studies that could serve as the basis for future longer-term, more extensive research projects, that evaluate the feasibility of using innovative computational approaches to enhance the ability of clinicians and biomedical scientists to solve one or more significant cognitive tasks and bring improvement in medical care to patients, families, and the public. The focus of this requirement is to fund meritorious projects that are innovative and offer significant technological advances in NLM's mission in the fields of science and health.</p>
<p>The debate about whether the human brain is a protoplasmic "digital computer" or functions by other means does not preclude continuing interest in the possibility that computers can carry out tasks that would be viewed as requiring intelligence if performed by humans. Artificial intelligence (AI), a term coined in 1956, seemed to have limitless potential, including the development of "thinking machines" such as HAL, in Kubrick's film, 2001: a Space Odyssey. Much was accomplished in knowledge representation, programming languages, and in development of expert systems that could do useful things in this or that domain. The latter, "partially intelligent artifacts", however, fell far short of duplicating the general intelligence of the human. Key challenges, for example, understanding of natural language in texts and speech, as well as generation of innovative ideas and discovery, remain partially or wholly unresolved. Because few today believe that "strong AI" i.e. human-like cognition or better, is a likely near-term achievement, research and development largely gravitated to "weak" or "applied" AI, intended to produce "smart" tools, such as a security system capable of face recognition.</p>
<p>To invigorate research in the arena of computation and cognition (and to avoid the increasingly diffuse connotations of the term "AI" Artificial Intelligence), a number of fresh concepts, each focused on somewhat different aspects of the issues, have arisen in recent years: computational intelligence, machine learning, intelligence amplifying systems, flexible competence, human-computer collaboration, and computational thinking inter alia.</p>

<p>In biomedicine, clinicians and researchers now face formidable challenges in information management, innovation, and decision-making in an era which is seeing extraordinarily rapid growth of knowledge, distributed among a host of databases, and on a scale far larger than can be mastered by an individual.

<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain contract development services that will develop and test computational approaches to one or more cognitive problems as commonly encountered by clinician, clinical researcher, biologist, or patient. NLM places no constraint on approach. Artificial neural nets, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, statistical (e.g., Bayesian inference, regression, etc.) and other methods, alone or in combination are acceptable as are novel approaches. NLM expects that progress on each proposed project will be an exploratory focus on feasibility testing; full scale development and formal testing are not requirements.</p>
<p>NLM intends to fund multiple contract awards to address these issues, with emphasis on novel approaches to computational thinking, and expects to fund a broad variety of methods of procedure in order to obtain an overview of what is promising in this arena and what is not.</p>
<p>Deliverables will be reports provided to NLM that include:<br />Introduction<br />Methodology<br />Results<br />Discussion<br />Proposed Future Directions<br />Summary<br />References</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY- The funding for this requirement will be made available under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) and all qualification criteria that arise from the use of ARRA funding apply to this requirement.<br /><br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure, as part of its "Medical Advanced Research Projects Initiative" feasibility or "proof of concept" studies that could serve as the basis for future longer-term, more extensive research projects, that evaluate the feasibility of using innovative computational approaches to enhance the ability of clinicians and biomedical scientists to solve one or more significant cognitive tasks and bring improvement in medical care to patients, families, and the public. The focus of this requirement is to fund meritorious projects that are innovative and offer significant technological advances in NLM's mission in the fields of science and health.
<p>The debate about whether the human brain is a protoplasmic "digital computer" or functions by other means does not preclude continuing interest in the possibility that computers can carry out tasks that would be viewed as requiring intelligence if performed by humans. Artificial intelligence (AI), a term coined in 1956, seemed to have limitless potential, including the development of "thinking machines" such as HAL, in Kubrick's film, 2001: a Space Odyssey. Much was accomplished in knowledge representation, programming languages, and in development of expert systems that could do useful things in this or that domain. The latter, "partially intelligent artifacts", however, fell far short of duplicating the general intelligence of the human. Key challenges, for example, understanding of natural language in texts and speech, as well as generation of innovative ideas and discovery, remain partially or wholly unresolved. Because few today believe that "strong AI" i.e. human-like cognition or better, is a likely near-term achievement, research and development largely gravitated to "weak" or "applied" AI, intended to produce "smart" tools, such as a security system capable of face recognition.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Bridging Group possesses a highly specialized combination of expertise in conducting research and evaluating projects that focus on HIV prevention programs for incarcerated men and their female partners; conducting site visits in community service settings; analyzing and integrating data with varying levels of quality from multiple sources; and writing reports for policy audiences.  Their experience with the Home project, coupled with their ability to provide evaluation expertise, both in qualitative and quantitative methods that has been tailored to measure the gender-specific needs, issues, assets and challenges unique to women with incarcerated male partners, gives the Bridging Group, the unique capability to conduct the activities that will be required by the resulting contract.

This sole source requirement will be awarded pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (a). Interested concerns who feel that they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the services required.

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with the award to The Bridging Group.

The RFP will be requesting the offerors bid known supplies, training and travel as part of their proposed costs, so this CLIN will only be used on a limited basis.  This procurement is a follow-on to the current sole source 8(a) award CPFF IDIQ contract for the FGA BOS which expires on September 30, 2009. The contract will support Fort Greely Alaska Garrison and agencies which collaborate with them on base support and missions in support of the warfighter.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT anticipates that one contract will be competitively awarded as a result of this 100% 8(a) set-aside. The resultant contract will have the capacity to provide base operation support to FGA and their tenants and shall support the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements, which include, but are not limited to:  MDA Lodging and Housekeeping, Fire Alarm Maintenance, Custodial, Indoor and Outdoor Pest Control, Access Control Services for MDC, Environmental, Engineering, Refuse Removal Transport and Disposal, MDA Facilities Maintenance, and Visitors Center.  Offerors will not bid on the draft PWS at this time. PWS Chapters 15  30 services are slated to be in-sourced with Department of Army Civilians.  If transition plan is delayed, the Contractor may be requested to provide these services to be determined.  The Contractor will not provide costs for these transition services in the final solicitation.  These chapters are merely for scope purposes, should the services be necessary.  The transition services are:  Automation and Network Support, Human Resources Support, Food Services, Logistic Support, Centralized Dispatch, Resource Management Administrative and Analyst, Single Soldier Housing (SSH) Support, Safety Operations Support, Snow Removal, Grounds Maintenance, Allen Army Airfield Operations and Services, Facilities Support/Service Order Repair (Garrison), Religious Support, Garrison Protocol Support, Strategic Planning Support, and Directorate of Public Works Business Operations.  When posted, the draft PWS, draft solicitation, applicable attachments and exhibits, and other historical FGA BOS documents and related information will be posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI). An initial round of one-on-one meetings were held with industry on February 3 and 4, 2009. These one-on-one meetings were held as a market research mechanism to help determine best commercial practices, to maximize competition, and achievement of cost efficiencies in the acquisition process. Questions and answers related to the one-on-one sessions and the draft PWS were not posted or released; however, recommendations that the Government considered relevant were incorporated into the solicitation. A draft solicitation and associated supporting documents will be posted to FedBizOps in a follow-on notice. At that time industry will be provided the opportunity to review the draft documents and specific instructions for providing comments/feedback. The final RFP will be posted to the ASFI after consideration and incorporation of relevant feedback/comments. All interested parties are encouraged to regularly monitor the website for all pertinent acquisition information ASFI will be the only official means for FGA BOS information dissemination. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 561210 and the small business size standard $35.5M. The resultant contract will establish a basic and six one-year ordering periods starting on September 30, 2009 and ending on September 30, 2016.<BR><BR>2.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), located on the National Naval Medical Campus (NNMC) in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with GE Healthcare for the following service &amp; maintenance agreement contract:
<p>&bull;	One (1) year of service and maintenance, with four (4) one- (1) year options, for one (1) AKTAexplorer 10 S with FRAC 950, SN: 1395684.</p>
<p>Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p>FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The AKTAexplorer 10 S is highly specialized in design and application requiring software and firmware updates and system component upgrades that are proprietary to the vendor. All major component parts and assemblies including circuit electronics are specialized in design whereby obtaining these parts from alternate sources as generic is not possible and not in the best interest of the Government. GE Healthcare is the manufacturer of this system. The manufacturer is the only company that has specialized and technical knowledge as well as the necessary tools, manpower and repair parts to maintain this piece of equipment in an operable state. Attempting to award this contract to another company could result in lost time in research and productivity. Another vendor was not located that had the technical and specialized knowledge and/or accessibility to repair parts for this system.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to Pierre.Smith.CTR@usuhs.mil by 5:00 PM (EST) on June 24, 2010.</p>

<CONTACT>Gwendolyn Cody, Phone 7704882436, Email dvv1@cdc.gov
<DESC>Program Outcome Evaluation of the MARCH Program in Addis Ababa University
<p>Background and General Objectives</p>
<p>This scope of work developed based on the recommendation of PEPFAR prevention Technical Working Group to undertake outcome evaluation by CDC-E independently through consultants.</p>
<p>The Modeling and Reinforcement to Combat HIV/AIDS (MARCH) program is a HIV/AIDS-related behavior change strategy. It is currently being implemented by Addis Ababa University (FPFPFP) among its students. Therefore, the target population for FP MARCH program is police personnel in the University.</p>
<p>The primary components of MARCH are two-fold: a print serial drama (PSD) and reinforcement activities (RAs). The PSD consists of a set of ongoing storylines presented in comic book format. In the PSD, fictional Federal Police personnel model HIV/AIDS-related behavior changes through a set of positive, negative, and transitional characters. There are four main transitional characters in the PSD which address the following behavior change objectives: counseling and testing for HIV, faithfulness, and correct and consistent condom use, adherence to anti-retroviral therapy, positive living with HIV/AIDS. The reinforcement activities- as implemented by FP - comprise training of Peer leaders. Peer leaders are responsible to undertake small group discussions, peer-led group discussions and organizing big events and sporting activities that focus on behavior change around the same objectives for about 1 to 2 hours, using the PSD episodes as the springboard for their discussions and activities. Through the combination of the PSD and the RAs, MARCH promotes positive changes in skills, self-efficacy, risk perceptions, social norms, and other constructs known from the literature to be good predictors of behavior.</p>
<p>FP has implemented the MARCH program among its members in Ethiopia since 2004, although the implementation of the full program was done in 2006 with the distribution and linked reinforcement activity based on the first PSD episode. Initial project activities included the training of peer leaders. Though MARCH is evidenced based successful HIV/AIDS behavior change intervention, the success of the program is not yet evidenced by independent scientific research about the practical successful MARCH project outcomes. Recently there is a need to conduct scientific research to witness about the results of MARCH project interventions. The study will try to answer the outcome of MARCH program to help police personnel in the federal police forces build self efficacy, adopt HIV/AIDS preventive sexual behaviors, create social norms supportive of accessing HIV/AIDS related services in the Addis Ababa University. The final evaluation report is very important for CDC-E PEPFAR HIV/AIDS prevention program to make strengthen the existing program or looks for alternatives to make strategic shift.</p>
<p>Objectives of the outcome evaluation</p>
<p>This program outcome evaluation will answer the following two questions 1) How the MARCH program is being implemented and 2) Behavioral outcomes by FP personnel to tackle HIV/AIDS as a result of MARCH HIV/AIDS intervention implementation. This helps PEPFAR prevention technical working group to make evidence based decisions in the implementation and management of prevention programs budget, and strategic interventions.</p>
<p>Scope of work</p>
<p>The consultancy firm will conduct a wide range of methodologies that can be appropriate to have a valid data in the outcome of MARCH program in the lives of the FP police forces police forces participated in the program, working closely with, and using background information and materials provided by, the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).</p>

<SUBJECT>Molecular Species Identification, Throughput Capability and Technology Transfer for Catfish Entering Retail Markets in the United States
<SOLNBR>409625
<RESPDATE>070710
<CONTACT>Vangelia Campbell, Contracting Officer, Email vangelia.campbell@fsis.usda.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Services (FSIS) is seeking sources capable of providing the agency with Molecular Species Identification, Throughput Capability and Technology Transfer for Catfish Entering Retail Markets in the United States. The Contractor shall; 1) Provide molecular techniques to positively identify relevant domestic and imported strains of catfish; 2) Provide technology transfer of methodologies and relevant information to FSIS as needed to perform species identification using DNA barcoding. The project is to develop and implement a protocol, and analyze data using DNA sequencing equipment with a throughput of up to 2,000 samples per month for a 10 month timeframe will be needed initially. Imported fish fillets identified as catfish account for approximately half of the 200 million pounds of U.S. catfish sales each year. Positive identification of these fillets is needed to differentiate between species and to detect mislabeling. Direct sequencing is the most definitive method available for fish identification. Unlike protein assays, it is applicable to degraded/processed samples. An approximately 600 base-pair region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) mitochondrial gene will be PCR amplified and sequenced in all relevant cultured domestic and imported strains of catfish from samples of muscle tissue taken from fresh, frozen, and processed fish. An internal reference database of COI sequences should be further developed and checked against the larger Barcode of Life database1 (BOLD) and FDA catfish barcodes to formalize DNA barcode sequences for species of interest. Standardized, streamlined protocols should be developed to allow rapid processing and analysis of large numbers of samples as provided by FSIS. Real-time PCR/SNP assays should be developed for short-turnaround true/false testing of samples. Sequence results, species IDs, and samples should be tracked via unique, anonymous identifiers and information should be made rapidly and securely available to FSIS. Rigorous quality control and random re-screening of samples should ensure the highest possible levels of accuracy. <br />The Contractor must have extensive experience with years of service in the area of catfish genetics and genomics and have organized and led large sequencing projects involving the majority of blue and channel catfish genes. Experience working with small genomic regions, large-scale molecular marker discovery and genotyping is expected. The number of submissions of catfish DNA sequences into public databases over the last decade from Ictalurid and pangaguis catfish will be strongly taken into consideration. The number of published reviewed papers on aspects of catfish genetics and genomics ranging from genetic diversity of aquaculture populations to repetitive elements present in catfish gene transcripts and genome regions will also be evaluated. Methods validation must follow FDA&lsquo;s July, 2009 Laboratory Information Bulletin 4420, volume 24, titled:"DNA-Barcoding for the Species Identification for Fish: A Protocol for Validation of DNA-Barcoding for the Species Identification of Fish for FDA Regulatory Compliance." The lab must be well-equipped with sufficient PCR (both standard and real-time) and DNA sequencing capacity to produce high-throughput catfish gene sequencing and data analysis without start-up delay. At the end of the project term, technology transfer (including equipment assessment) will occur for FSIS to outfit their labs to continue to perform genotyping and data analysis. The Contractor must submit monthly reports of data results and quarterly progress reports including budget expenditures. All data and data results are the property of FSIS. As part of project, software developed (database functionality) and related files will be turned over to FSIS at the completion of this project.
<p>If you are a source capable of providing the above services, please respond to this Source Sought with your company's information, containing your qualifications. Respondents are asked to identify their business size in their response to this sources sought synopsis. The NAICS Code associated with this notice is 541380 and the size standard is $12.0M.

This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research. <br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.<br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure operations and management support services to support resolution of NBS accounting and budget issues that may negatively impact the NIH NBS funds control implementation on behalf of the National Institutes of Health. <br />Title: NBS Support Services<br />BACKGROUND
<p>More than a decade ago, National Institutes of Health (NIH) was one of the first Federal agencies to consider the use of commercial enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to support Federal financial management. At the time, NIH realized that it needed to retire its then decades-old Core Accounting System (CAS) and the Administrative Database (ADB), for inventory, procurement, property management, travel, human resources and central accounting. In spite of the systems' ability to handle transactions at NIH, the systems were becoming obsolete and had to be replaced.</p>
<p>In 1999, NIH began developing the business case for the Oracle-based system that is now the NIH Business Systems or NBS. After significant planning efforts and securing funding for the project, NBS implementation began, module by module. The system now provides tremendous capability and functionality to serve the needs of its customers in the NIH Office of the Director (OD) and across its 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs).</p>
<p>Although NBS now serves as the system of record for the many transactions produced at NIH each day, vision for the system has yet to be fully achieved. Enhancements to the system, its environment and the financial management practices in use at NIH require renewed efforts to develop the world class management capabilities needed to support the world's leading medical research institution. At present, legacy systems are still in use and must be retired to eliminate redundancies, minimize costs and improve financial management and internal control. Other systems within NIH and at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) have yet to have their financial transaction integrated with NBS. For example, the agency's electronic Research Administration (eRA) Information for Management, Planning, Analysis and Coordination (IMPAC II) system, which processes 55,000 grant funding transactions each year, is operated by the Office of Extramural Research (OER). Failure to integrate financial aspects of this the system with NBS perpetuates weaknesses in financial controls for the nearly $25 billion in grants payments made each year. The addition of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding - nearly $10.5 billion at NIH - has significantly increased the amount of grant funding, the number of grant payments processed and the risk associated with having a grants management system that does not have its financial transactions directly integrated with NBS.</p>
<p>Enhancements to the system, its environment and the financial management practices in use at NIH require renewed efforts to develop the world class management capabilities needed to support the world's leading medical research institution. These enhancements are now planned as a series of projects collectively known as the NIH Healthier Financial Management Initiatives (HFMI).</p>
<p>Recently, several driving factors have converged on the NBS Program, which together call on the NBS Program Office to pragmatically consider a number of major financial management initiatives:</p>
<p>Audit findings have noted that the NIH continues to operate NBS without systemic funds checking enabled. Thus, the NBS Program must implement funds checking to prevent Anti-Deficiency Act violations, comply with emerging OMB and treasury requirements and ensure audit compliance.</p>
<p>Congress has required NIH to institute reprogramming controls at the sub-mechanism level. The 2010 Congressional appropriation defined funds control/funds management requirements for NIH. The language requires funds control at the sub-mechanism level, which is a component of the NBS Account Code Structure (ACS) that is not fully enabled for NIH in that the sub-mechanism values have not been fully created or used consistently in account combinations. NIH is currently in conversation with the Appropriations Committee to set the time line for achieving business process and accounting system reprogramming controls. The efforts in this current project will consider this evolving situation and ensure that decisions in system development advance (or at a minimum do not hinder) NIH's capability to implement Congressionally directed controls.</p>
<p>Under combined resources from the 2009 economic stimulus funding (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) and the annual appropriations provided for NBS activities, NIH determined that enhancing the integration of its independent grant and accounting enterprise systems could address these driving factors and significantly improve enterprise operations and support national goals of greater governmental transparency.</p>
<p>This improvement effort consists of a group of interrelated projects referred to as the NIH Healthier Financial Management Integration (HFMI). HFMI consists of the following projects.</p>
<p>o Funds Control - Implement funds management functionality to achieve Anti-deficiency Act compliance)<br />o MAS Retirement - Retire MAS/CAN Maintenance <br />o Grants Integration - Integrate financial aspects of IMPACII-NBS</p>
<p>o Strategies for implementing the Common Government-wide Accounting Classification (CGAC)<br />o Integrate Payment Management System (PMS) with NBS<br />o Implement Oracle Projects<br />o Integrate Payroll-NBS</p>
<p>The HFMI design, development and implementation was procured under a separate contract and is not part of this requirement. This effort is intended to resolve accounting and budget issues that could hamper the implementation of these initiatives.<br />Specific Tasks</p>
<p>Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide expert Information Technology Professional Services to the NIH Business System (NBS) Project for systems analysis, design, programming, conversion and implementation support. These services relate specifically to the analysis and resolution of existing NBS accounting issues identified in NIH Remedy Help Desk System that could negatively impact NIH ability to institute full systemic funds control to begin FY2011 and/or close/open the books for FY2010/2011. <br />DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>The specific current tasks include assistance on the following:</p>

<p>Assessment of the NIH Remedy Help Desk System tickets that are NBS Budget related to determine impacts on full systemic funds control implementation. For Remedy tickets that may negatively impact the full systemic funds control implementation or Oracle Federal Administration budget initialization activities; analyze, develop and implement appropriate resolutions to eliminate or mitigate the budget process identified deficiencies.</p>
<p>Support the analysis, development and implementation of any new activities necessary to support the NBS Annual Close processes and procedures that are related to the implementation of HFMI. This includes participation in the NIH NBS annual close internal and external meetings.</p>

This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. No telephone calls will be accepted. After review of the responses submitted regarding this potential acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities if the Government intends to continue with the procurement.
The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Engineering Service Center (ESC) is seeking sources for a future contract to deploy the automated explosives safety siting application 'Explosives Safety Siting' (ESS) software  to all DoD sites in the continental US and abroad.  Deployment of this software will include one or more of the following tasks: base startup support, local personnel training, help-desk support for the application, and engineering services to perform siting analysis studies.  The software will be used by all DoD services both inside the continental US and abroad (CONUS and OCONUS).
Base period consists of aiding local installations with the preparation of their data to conform to the ESS system requirements.  ESS requires accurate input for GIS, Real Property Inventory (RPI), and explosives data.
Personnel training consists of initial training for new users and refresher training as deemed necessary by the DoD services.  Training is available in multiple formats ranging from internet web-casts to on site training.
Help-desk support consists of providing technical assistance to ESS users that encounter problems when using the software.  Help-desk support is given over the phone or through web-conferencing.  In-depth technical expertise of the ESS software is required for all help-desk technicians.
Site Analysis Studies include site-specific engineering analyses of blast and fragment hazards from explosions.  These structural analyses are guided by DoD protective construction design requirements.  Respondents should provide the following information about their capabilities and experience in the following areas: a. Knowledge and experience in the application of DoD, Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force explosive safety criteria.b. Understanding in the use and application of ESS software and certified in the use of the software.c.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
In preparation for a future procurement, the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) is performing market research to determine potential sources that are small businesses. The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide technical and analytical support to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) and other divisions within OTAQ. 
ASD has the primary responsibility for developing mobile source emissions models and inventories and developing and promulgating mobile source air emission standards under Title II of the Clean Air Act Amendments of November 15, 1990 (CAAA). Studying, modeling, and regulating Greenhouse Gas emissions from mobile sources, as well as studying new engine technologies and fuels to reduce these emissions, has become a major area of focus for ASD, which also works with other divisions in OTAQ on these issues.
Specific areas to be addressed in capability packages submitted by respondents are as follows: (1) Capabilities to provide economic, environmental, statistical, scientific, and evaluative analysis support, (2) Capabilities to provide technical and engineering analysis support, (3) Capabilities to provide Graphical Information Systems (GIS), training, peer review, literature review and analysis, information collection request (ICR) and database development support, and (4) Capabilities to provide communication, outreach, meeting and public hearing, docketing, response to public comments, guidance, training, and regulatory program support.
The successful contractor of any resultant contract will be expected to provide all necessary labor, materials, and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS). A draft PWS can be obtained for the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/. 
Any interested firms should submit capability statement with information that clearly demonstrates their capabilities to provide the services described above, including personnel, experience, and qualifications. Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.
It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) with five one-year periods, each with LOE of approximately 26,000 hours. The applicable NAICS code is 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services) with a small business size standard of $7 million. In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women-owned, small-disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern. 
As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. These capability statements are merely and aid to the EPAs market research efforts. Respondents are advised that EPA is under no obligation to provide respondents with any feedback on the information received. 
Responses to the above should be submitted to Lisa Ryle, U.S. EPA, Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division, 26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268 no later than July 19, 2010. A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP), resulting from this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Mental Health Primary Care Integration - Behavioral Health Lab (253 -VHA/OI&T I.  

The VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic health record system, Computer Patient Record System (CPRS), Mental Health Primary Care Integration is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   

CPRS does not allow decision support at the point of care nor does it have practical patient tracking features.  The VA developed software, Behavioral Health Laboratory (BHL) is utilized at a myriad of VA medical centers to provide tracking and clinical support functions; however, its major limitation is that it currently does not interface with CPRS.

VA's VistA system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.

Requirements
VA wants an interface between BHL and CPRS so that mental health assessment data is instantly available in the medical record and patients will not need to be registered separately in the software.  
Submittal Information

<DESC>DSCP intends to issue a sole source bridge Contract for Wood Products for the Hawaii/Guam Region to Dooley Lumber Company. Subject contract is for twelve months and twelve days to provide for the purchase of wood products, such as softwood lumber, hardwood lumber, plywood/veneer, preservative treated lumber, poles, pilings, crossarms, ties, dowels, plugs, stakes, doors, and moldings to support military customers in the Hawaii/Guam region. The Estimated Demand is $600,000.00. The maximum dollar value for this proposed contract is $3,000,000. For administrative purposes, the proposed bridge contract will use the same numbers as the current contract and will contain the same terms and conditions. The contract numbers are SPM500-05-D-BP21/SPM5E406D0254. Two contract numbers are utilized to prevent duplication of delivery order numbers as both system-processed (mechanized) orders and manual orders are issued. The effective period of the proposed bridge contract will be from June 24, 2010 through July 5, 2011.
<p>Should the competitively-awarded contract be issued ahead of the projected timeframe and the guaranteed minimum of $100,000 met, this bridge contact will be terminated. One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements. Subject Bridge Contract is being awarded under Other than Full and Open Competition 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties should contact the POCs: Mary.Ryan@dla.mil and Jeffrey.Kochanowicz@dla.mil</p>

<DESC><p>The Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA)&nbsp;intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the American Public Human Services Association 810 First Street NE ,Suite 500 Washington DC 2002-4267.<br />The purpose of this requisition is as follows:<br />The contractor will provide analytical support, including policy, data and environmental analysis, associated with emerging Medicaid policies that will impact HRSA-related safety net providers. The analysis will result in options and recommendations for solutions or appropriate adjustment to these policies. HRSA intends to engage state Medicaid programs on issues of concern to HRSA-related safety net providers as these entitles provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries and address many aspects of health care reform. State Medicaid programs are one of the most critical partners of HRSA-related safety net providers. They provide critical resources that help safety net providers fulfill their mission of providing access to quality, affordable health care to low-income and vulnerable populations. Medicaid accounts for 34 percent of health center fiscal budget. Many of the people affected by Medicaid changes are health centers patient who will likely continue to seek care at health centers. Medicaid is a primary source of financing for State, local and community-based maternal and child health services. It is an important partner to maternal and child health Title V grantees and is a critical source of financing for health care services to children including adolescents and women. Medicaid is also the largest single public payer of medical services for persons living with HIV/AIDS. Medicaid is a critical source of insurance coverage in rural America, filling gaps in both Medicare coverage and the availability and accessibility of private insurance that are more pronounced in rural than in urban areas. <br />With the passage of the health care reform, State Medicaid programs are likely to serves as a primary vehicle to expand health coverage for low-income and uninsured individuals, especially childless adults. With recent changes in the health care delivery system and changes within Medicaid, it is critically necessary that coordination between State Medicaid Directors, HRSA constituents and HRSA-related safety net providers occurs. Coordination and collaboration are needed to ensure that medically under served individuals continue to receive access to high quality health services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The period of performance will be for 18 (eighteen) months. The contract will be issued as a fixed price contract.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for sole sourcing is 41USC 254(C)(1),&nbsp;as set forth in FAR&nbsp;6.302-1(ii) (A), It is likely that an award to any other service would result in(A) substantial duplication of cost to the Government&nbsp; that is not expected to be recovered through competition."<br />A justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared by the Government.<br />This notice 0f intent is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposal.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)with Progress Software Corporation,14 Oak Park Drive, Bedford, MA 01730-1485,to provide Progress Software's ObjectStore database engine, to integrate existing and planned components of NIST, MET's Enterprise Information Systems-CIMS. MEP has developed CIMS using the Java Enterprise Edition standard employing an object-oriented database management system and application development techniques. The system uses MEP's application server of choice BEA Systems Weblogic Server. This approach required making the application server totally independent from the database, which resulted in the need for an in-memory persistent cache. Only ObjectStore provides both complete integration with Weblogic Application Server and support for in-memory persistent caching. Without ObjectStore, MEP will not be able to maintain CIMS. This is proprietary software only available with Progress Software. <br />A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about June 24, 2010, and the period of performance shall be July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011.<br />Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis. Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Justification for Brand Name Products

Date:	June 17, 2010 Project:	Upgrade of Canyon Wastewater Treatment Plant's Programmable Logic Controller 
1.	Identifications
a.	Agency:	National Park Serviceb.	Contracting Office:	Yellowstone National Park

2.	Description of the action being approved:
This action is for the upgrade and replacement of the Canyon Wastewater Treatment Plant's Programmable Logic Controller and corresponding software applications.  The Canyon Wastewater Treatment plant (WWTP) first came online in the late nineties.  A Siemens Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) TI545 was installed originally and is now obsolete.  The primary control of the PLC was the plant's automatic backwash cycle.  We now operate in a manual backwash mode.  The manual backwash operation takes manpower and time.  During the peak operating season from May until November the plant runs 24 hours a day. The intent of this project is to update the PLC with a DirectLogic PLC model 205, using the Phoenix Contact's WINPLC with Think & Do runtime software application for programming and Canary Systems MultiLogger for data acquisition.  Yellowstone National Park has already installed automation controls and SCADA systems using these brands and needs to keep a "continuity of operations" as we move forward with future updates park wide.
The documents included with the solicitation call for specific brand name products that are peculiar to one manufacturer. This written justification provides approval for limiting competition to the listed brand name products as authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).
3.	Description of Supplies and Services:		            DirectLogic  Programmable Logic Controller            Phoenix Contact's Think&Do 8.0 Software		 
4.	Authority:41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
FAR Part 11.105: The Brand Name products are essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products do not meet and cannot be modified to meet the agency's needs.
FAR 13.106(b):  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization).

5.	The description of the product's unique qualifications or the unique nature of the acquisition:	This programmable logic controller and corresponding software applications will replace the obsolete and malfunctioning controller already in place in the Canyon Wastewater Treatment Plant.  In order to maintain a continuity of operations within Yellowstone's Water and Wastewater Plant's corresponding controls are essential.  The amount of manpower and cost to maintain systems with different software programs and controller's would not be effective to the parks mission.  
Efforts to obtain competition:
Efforts to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:
This acquisition will be advertised and available on FedBizOpps (The Official Government Point of Entry) for any contractors that supply this particular Name Brand equipment to provide offers.
6.	Certifications:

a.	Technical / Requirements Certification:

"	I do hereby recommend the use of the Brand Name products noted above for the procurement noted above."	I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

The organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:00 CST on 21 June  2010. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Please submit information for consideration by the Government to Alicia.M.Kennedy@usace.army.mil with solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR><BR>A larger number of geophones are necessary to meet mission goals for current and ongoing research and development related to clandestine tunnel detection, void detection, and determination of seismic properties for site characterization and modeling and simulation parameters. ERDC currently only have up to 48 geophones in the lower frequency range and 24 higher frequency geophones, yet have 240 seismograph channels available. <BR><BR>The geophones described are compatible with geophysical equipment currently in use by the ERDC personnel including the current inventory of seismic cables and geophones. These specific geophones are also the same models used on the Active Seismic Imaging platform as part of the Rapid Reaction Tunnel Detection. Using the same models allows us to interchange with our augment the ASI configuration and directly compare data acquired through conventional acquisition methods. Mixing different model geophones from different vendor is not advisable and is detrimental to post-acquisition data processing and analysis. <BR><BR>For questions concerning this purchase, please contact Steve Sloan at (601) 618-5435 or Steven.D.Sloan@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR><BR>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" mce_style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span>The US Agency for International Development hereby provides notice of its intent to award a sole-source, cost-plus-fixed-fee follow-on contract to the IRIS Center, University Research Center Corporation International, 3106 Morrill Hall, College   Park Maryland 20742. Funding will be less than $1 million.<span>&nbsp; </span>The </span>contract is expected to be awarded under FAR 6.302-1.<span> </span>A Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared. The period of performance shall be 12 months from July 6, 2010<span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" mce_style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span>The contract will support the continued development and improvement of country-specific “poverty assessment tools,” together with training and help desk support for the proper use of those tools.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each poverty assessment tool consists of (1) household survey, specific to each country; (2) a set of statistically derived weights linking the survey data reported by each household to an estimate of its per-capita consumption or income; and (3) a software application that allows users to input the required survey data gathered from a sample of households and use them to estimate the prevalence of poverty among the population from which that sample was drawn.<span>&nbsp; </span>USAID is required to develop poverty assessment tools by the Microenterprise Results and Accountability Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-484); it also expects to use those tools to monitor the poverty impact of the Feed the Future food security initiative.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" mce_style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span>To meet USAID standards of accuracy and ease of use, each poverty assessment tool submitted for certification must meet an extensive set of quality standards, including identification of the most informative set of household characteristics through a systematic process of search among all characteristics included in integrated household surveys using the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) format; selection of the best estimating technique through systematic comparison of alternative techniques (including techniques robust to non-normal errors); insertion of the statistical results into an easy-to-use software application; calibration against multiple poverty lines in each country; and many others.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor will be required to organize and manage one or more in-country household surveys using the LSMS format.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor will also be required to provide expert training – using both in-person and e-learning formats – and help desk support for users of the more than 30 certified poverty assessment tools as well as any additional tools developed in the course of the project. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" mce_style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span>The services required to meet USAID’s legal obligation to continue developing and supporting the use of poverty assessment tools are highly specialized.<span>&nbsp; </span>USAID believes that awarding the proposed contract to another source would result in unacceptable delays in meeting this legal obligation, as well as </span>substantial additional costs to the government, <span>as the new source gradually developed the skills needed to meet USAID’s requirements.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;" mce_style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<span>&nbsp; </span>All responsible sources may submit an offer; however, only services meeting USAID’s requirements will be considered for award. USAID will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice of intent. Only written responses will be considered.<span>&nbsp; </span>All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered. As a result of analyzing responses to this notice of intent, the Government shall determine that a solicitation will be issued. Any prospective contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.<span>&nbsp; </span>Information concerning CCR registered requirements may be viewed via the Internet at httpl/www.ccr.gov or by calling the CCR Registration Center at 1-888-227 -2423. Interested parties are encouraged to furnish information.<span>&nbsp; </span>All documents submitted will not be returned. All interested parties shall submit clear and convincing documentation demonstrating their capabilities to satisfy the requirements listed above to David Lavine by email at dalavine@usaid.gov. The capability documentation should include general information and technical background describing in detail the prospective contractor’s capabilities and experience that will demonstrate the ability to support these requirements.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote, solicitation number SP3300-10-Q-0126.
The Defense Distribution Center located in New Cumberland, PA has a requirement to purchase BMC Remedy Software and Maintenance.  This is a brand name requirement and the justification is as follows:   

BMC Remedy Software is the only IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) certified management suite that is approved for use on the DLA Network.  DDC –J6N adopted ITIL process model for managing information technology in support of our field activities and DDC functional areas.  Our market research revealed this product has demonstrated to be the most capable and full-featured tool suite, providing all required automated support for the Incident, Problem, Configuration, Change and Service Level management processes.  Remedy ITSM surpasses the total functionality of other products with outstanding features, such as notification capability and ease of configuration for enterprise deployment.  Additionally, the current J6N Remedy ARS application is CAC-enabled, a feature not commercially supported by any other similar application.

This procurement of BMC Remedy ITSM software is the only software that performs all the functions that are included in the base BMC Remedy system.  There are other systems out in the corporate world that do similar functions, but DDC-J6N is attempting to increase the current capability of the BMC Remedy ARS system by including the ITSM suite to the tools that are already in use at J6N.  No other commercially available software can integrate with the existing BMC Remedy ARS software.  Additionally, BMC Remedy is the only ITIL certified Information Technology Service Management Suite that has been approved for use on the DLA networks.

This is an unrestricted acquisition for vendors that can provide the BMC Remedy Software and Maintenance to meet the requirements specified.  The NAICS code is 511210.  The size standard is $7,000,000.00.  

See attached schedule of supplies and services for CLIN identification (Attachment 1).

Offerors shall provide a firm fixed unit price, inclusive of shipping (FOB Destination) for each CLIN and the total amount.  Delivery is required by 1 July 2010 to the Defense Distribution Depot Susquehanna, Base Sup EBS Bldg. 203 Dr 12, 5450 Carlisle Pike, Mechanicsburg PA 17050-2411.

<p>Title: OS on Secure (FIPS 140-2 Level 3) USB Devices</p>
<p>Date: June 17, 2010</p>
<p>******************************************************************************</p>
<p>FEMA OCIO would like to welcome and encourage all companies to participate in this solicitation that have the technology and resources that we are seeking. This is a "Full and Open Competition" for Commercial Items (See Clauses below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />This solicitation will result in a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) award with (1) one year base period and several optional CLINS that can be exercised at the government's discretion (see Phase II SOW for CLIN structure).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Prior to FEMA posting this RFP for the OS Secure USB we posted an RFI to the industry via Fed Biz Opps for any and all vendors to submit samples in which were tried and tested by the government. We chose this method to gauge the current technology for the OS Secure USB and received numerous responses with samples. Because there was a market arena that is able to provide this technology we are seeking and are posting a formal RFP which will still allow for new vendors as well as the past vendors during the RFI to submit their proposals/samples to the government for consideration.</p>
<p><br />FEMA OCIO is hereby requesting that you submit an offer to: participate in Phase I: providing OS Secure USB sample test devices (per the instructions of the attachment) and Phase II: providing a Technical and Cost proposal as per the SOW attachment. Ultimately the goal of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to select a contractor to provide service and two hundred OS on Secure (200) FIPS 140-2 level 3 certified USB devices, the Operating System to allow access to the Agency's Windows based software system, along with the service to configure, install, and provide the Government the capability to centrally manage the devices (remote management via a web based control center) For full disclosure please **carefully read attachment Phase I and Phase II.</p>
<p>******************************************************************************</p>
<p>*********Please note there will be "NO CALLS, or Emails answered or addressed until the Q&amp;A session (for full details see below) ***** failure to comply will result in a non-acceptance for the proposal/samples from the vendor.</p>
<p>****************************************************************************** <br />See the following Attachments:<br />1. Requirements Statement, Instructions to Offerors, and Contract Clauses Attachment<br />2. Phase I: Samples/Technical Requirements/Evaluation<br />3. Phase II: Technical/Cost Proposal/SOW<br />4.

PROVISIONS

52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following non-price factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Location, Facility, Availability, Past Performance and Energy Efficiency.  All five non-price factors are equal in importance.  When combined, all non-price factors are significantly more important than Price.  

The following factors will be used in evaluating Technical Proposals: 

(i)	Location: Offeror shall propose a facility within described area; Eastern boundary Atlantic Ocean, Northern boundary Margate-Northfield Blvd/563 to Garden State Parkway . Garden State Parkway is the western boundary . From Garden State Parkway the Southern boundary is Mays landing road take a left  on shore road and a right on Longport Somers Point Blvd to Ventnor Avenue. 
  .  Evaluation will examine walking distance from mass transit, easy access to major roadways, and if the site is easily accessible to veterans both locally and from the freeway.  Site placement shall allow for a large independent "Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic" sign to assist patients in locating the clinic.  

(ii)	Facility: 

a.	Condition of Building:  Evaluation of building condition includes, but is not limited to: Is building already constructed to VA clinical office standards?  Is building handicapped-accessible?  Are there sufficient windows for lighting purposes?  Are handrails installed in bathrooms and throughout the building?  Is the building located on the main floor?  (Preferred: Main floor locations)  Is the building located on one floor, or split between two or more levels?  (Preferred: One floor)  Is the waiting room of sufficient size to be easily accessible by patients and caregivers? Does the facility have a fully sprinkler suppression system in place? Does the facility have a separate employee's entrance? 

b.	Capability of Proposed Space to Meet Existing Requirements:  Evaluation of space capability includes, but is not limited to:  Determination if the proposed space provides at least 9500 Net Useable Square Feet under ANSI/BOMA standards.  Determination whether the hallways, doorways, exam rooms and other areas wide enough to accommodate gurneys and wheelchairs.  Whether the building already wired for computer access with sufficient computer drops.  Determination if the building is already sufficiently plumbed and wired with electricity.  Determination if there is sufficient parking available (49 spaces), including handicapped parking and a handicapped drop-off zone near the entrance(s).  Determination if there sufficient restrooms for patients and staff.  Evaluation if there are sufficient handicapped-accessible restrooms. 

(iii)	Availability: 

In this factor, evaluation will be based on the date and time that the proposed facility is available for the Government to begin seeing patients.  Evaluation will consider work to be performed (build-out time and expense) or if the facility is "move-in ready".  Facilities requiring less time and money for preparation will be rated more favorably than those requiring more build-out expense. 


(iv)	Past Performance:  

Offerors are to adequately describe relevant experience that is similar in scope and magnitude to this requirement.  Provide three (3) references, preferably of Government work, performed in the last five (5) years.  Proposals are to provide description of services provided in contracts.

(v) 	Energy Efficiency:   
	Evaluation of this factor to be based on compliance with the following:
FAR 52.223-15 "Energy Efficiency in Energy-Consuming Products" 
FAR 52.223-16 "IEEE 1680 Standard for the Environmental Assessment of Personal Computer Products (Dec 2007)" 
FAR 52.223-17 "Affirmative Procurement of EPA-Designated Items in Service and Construction Contracts (May 2008)" 
(These regulations can be viewed online at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.)


(vi)	Price:

Price will be evaluated as its own factor and will be worth somewhat less than the Technical Factors above.  Proposals shall include all services as outline in the Schedule.  The total price shall be inclusive of all base year Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) and option year CLINs.  The Contract Specialist will perform a price analysis to determine the reasonableness of proposed price in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(B)(2).  The Government will utilize a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. Normally, adequate price competition establishes price reasonableness (see FAR 15.403-1(c)(1)). 
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

All prospective contractors MUST be U.S. citizens or MUST have established and maintain legal residence in the U.S., and are authorized by the US government to work in the United States (i.e. Green card, worker authorization, etc.). All prospective contractors MUST have at least one form of U.S. government issued photo identification (drivers license, U.S. passport, U.S. work visa, etc.) for entry to the installation.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516 ,  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is designated as full and open competition. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), Western Ecology Division (WED), Ecosystem Effects Branch (EEB), 200 S.W. 35th Street, Corvallis, Oregon, 97333, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13.1, on a firm-fixed price basis, intends to procure the following item: (1) X-Ray Diffractometer System.
Primary and secondary minerals present in soils and sediments influence the sorption and desorption of many environmentally important compounds and the sequestration of carbon. These minerals often exist as mixtures of many different minerals which complicates their identification and quantification.  Knowledge of these minerals is crucial for understanding how they influence ecosystem processes.  Additionally, many of the new manufactured nanomaterials and those that will be produced in the future are simply nano-sized primary or secondary minerals with some surface modifications.  
While manufacturers provide some information about their nanomaterial products, it generally lacks the specificity needed to know what forms or phases of minerals might be present.  It is imperative to know what minerals, phases of minerals and the amount of each mineral present to characterize the effects on nanomaterials in the environment.  However, few tools exist that can be used to identify and quantify these minerals other than X-Ray Diffraction (XRD).  Modern XRD instruments, such as the one described herein, utilize extensive databases, advanced mathematical algorithms and computers to rapidly identify and quantify the minerals.  
In the EEB at WED we are embarking on two new research areas in which information about the minerals present will be crucial to the success of the research.  In one project, minerals in soils and sediments will be used to better understand the role that soils have in providing ecosystem services, which affect human and environmental well-being.  In the other, the effects of nanomaterials in the environment are being evaluated and it will be crucial to precisely know the nature of the materials being investigated.  The instrument requested herein will provide information that will be directly utilized by both projects.  
This instrument will be used on projects under the new Eco Multi-Year Plan.  Specifically the Willamette-Ecosystem Services Project (WESP).  It will also be used to support Goal 4, Healthy Communities and Ecosystems, Emerging Issues and External Factors, on the new Nanotechnology Research Plan.  The Nanotechnolgy Research Plan is an EPA contribution to the President?s National Nanotechnology Initiative.

52.0100-4094  MARKING INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL ITEMS TO INCLUDE DROP
                        SHIP AND DIRECT SHIPMENT (DMA)(OCT 2008) 

The Contractor shall attach two (2) copies of a detailed packing list with each box or container with unlike items where the full description of the contents is not authorized or cannot be shown.  Include one (1) copy of the packing list inside the box or container and attach one (1) copy of the packing list on the outside of the box or container.  The outside of the box or container must also include the complete shipping address as provided in the schedule and the Contract/Purchase/Delivery Order number located on Page 1 of this document. 

The packing list shall contain the following information:  

     (a)  Contract number/Purchase Order number or Delivery Order number
     (b)  Package number and set number (if any) of the container.  
     (c)  A list of the contents which shows the quantity by item, item description, part
number, type and size, unit of issue if other than each.  
     
NOTE!
The government WILL NOT ACCEPT items shipped without a packing list especially when the content of the package is unidentifiable; rejected items will be returned at the contractor’s expense.  

INCOMPLETE DELIVERIES 

Incomplete delivery refers to the incomplete shipment of a unit of issue of an individual contract line item (CLIN).   Such Incomplete, or fragmented delivery of any part of a CLIN is not authorized and will not be accepted.   Each item (CLIN), including all components and sub-items, is to be delivered complete. Where sub-line items are reflected as component parts of an item, all sub-line items must be delivered simultaneously to form the complete item.


INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS - MANDATORY:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” or the “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the “Invoice” option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS<br />June 17th, 2010<br /> <br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />5:30 PM, July 9th, 2010
<p>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on the efforts of both the United States and China to achieve a leading position in the development and manufacture of green technologies, and the implications of such efforts for the future of the U.S. economy and the U.S. manufacturing base. This request for proposals (RFP) supersedes an earlier RFP on this topic released by the Commission (Federal Business Opportunities solicitation number USCC-016, dated Feb. 9, 2010). An associated memorandum for this RFP (copied at the end of this RFP) further clarifies aspects of green technology development in China that the Commission believes have already been covered in other recent studies, and which do not need to be addressed in this project.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION.  The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the economic and national security dimensions of the United States' trade and economic ties with the PRC. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov .</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in 22 U.S.C. 7002), which states that "The Commission... shall investigate and report exclusively on - <br />...<br />ECONOMIC TRANSFERS-The qualitative and quantitative nature of the transfer of United States production activities to the People's Republic of China, including the relocation of high technology, manufacturing, and research and development facilities, [and] the impact of such transfers on United States national security... and the effect of such transfers on United States economic security and employment...<br />ENERGY-The effect of the large and growing economy of the People's Republic of China on world energy supplies and the role the United States can play (including joint research and development efforts and technological assistance), in influencing the energy policy of the People's Republic of China..."</p>
<p>ABOUT PROPOSALS.  The Commission solicits proposals from contractors capable of providing a one-time unclassified report on the efforts of both the United States and China to achieve a leading position in the development and manufacture of green technologies, and the implications of such efforts for the future of the U.S. economy and the U.S. manufacturing base.</p>
<p>Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:</p>
<p>1.	Assess parallel developments of both the U.S. and Chinese "green technology" sectors. What are the comparative efforts being made in both countries to achieve a leading position in the development and manufacture of green technologies?</p>
<p>2.	Identify the leading green technologies under development. Identify how each country's efforts correlate to the green technologies list identified by the World Bank.  What is the comparative "state of the art" in these technologies in both the United States and China - i.e., who is "leading" and who is "lagging" in the development of these technologies? What are the most prominent companies and research institutions developing these technologies in each country? And, how does the development of green technologies in the United States and China compare with related efforts in other parts of the world?</p>
<p>3.	The Chinese government offers considerable support to its domestic green technology producers (through the employment of industrial subsidies, favorable tax policies, restrictions on market access by foreign competitors, etc. - see associated memo). Provide analysis in regards to the substantive impact of these supports - i.e., have subsidies affected the quality of Chinese-manufactured green technology equipment, etc.? Also, how do public policy supports for green technology development within the United States compare to these government programs in China?</p>
<p>4.	If such steps have been, or could be, taken, which of the Chinese government's supports to its domestic green technology producers might violate international rules regarding industrial subsidies (including both prohibited and actional subsidies, as defined by the WTO)?</p>
<p>5.	What role has China played at WTO talks on a sectoral agreement on environmental goods?  How might a sectoral agreement in this area advance U.S. and Chinese interests?   Identify the current trade barriers, if any, maintained by Chinese in the area of environmental products and whether those barriers would be addressed by the current approach being taken by U.S. trade negotiators.</p>
<p>6.	China has signaled that it intends to limit government procurement of technology products that don't have Chinese intellectual content. How does this relate to China's WTO commitments? What would be the effect of such a policy on U.S. industries? What would be the effect on U.S. companies and industries if this restriction were also adopted by China's state owned enterprises?</p>
<p>7.	Assess the overall balance of trade between China and the United States in such technologies, as well as the specific trade patterns, over the last five years, in each major product area.</p>
<p>8.	What is the state of market penetration and market access for U.S. and other foreign producers in China's green technology market? What U.S. companies have been able to supply green technologies for use in China?   To what extent are these products produced in the United States?</p>
<p>9.	What is the state of market penetration and market access for Chinese producers in the U.S. green technology market? Identify specific sourcing and development contracts that Chinese companies have engaged in to supply green technologies to the U.S. market.  As part of this effort, review specific opportunities for providing Chinese content that have been created by Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (for example, the "Texas Wind Farm" project).  Identify any other ARRA or other U.S. federal funds that have been used to procure Chinese-sourced green technology products or components.</p>
<p>10.	Identify Chinese investment activities to manufacture green products within the United States for use in the U.S. market.   How are these facilities going to be sourced, and what is the percentage of U.S.-produced components that will be utilized in such facilities (for example, the Chinese-announced photovoltaic assembly facility to be located in Arizona)?</p>
<p>11.	China has developed thriving industries in solar panels, wind turbines, and optoelectronics. What are the identifiable factors that led to China's preeminence in these fields? Also, to what extent are these products being manufactured for export, and to what extent are they produced for domestic consumption?</p>
<p>12.	In terms of joint ventures in the green technology sector between foreign and Chinese firms, are there any identifiable issues related to the potential transfer to China of dual-use technology, and/or the transfer of manufacturing and managerial know-how that could have spin-off benefits for military-industrial manufacturing?</p>
<p>Additional Requirements of the Commission:<br />1.	Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal Central Contractor Registry (CCR).<br />2.	Once a contractor has been selected for this project by the Commission and a contract signed, public notice of this will be made on the Commission's website. <br />3.	The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion.  In ordinary circumstances, once a contractor has been selected by the Commission and a contract signed, a draft of the report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 120 days from the date of contract confirmation. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments.  The Commission recognizes that, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract.  The contractor, in their initial submission, should stipulate the time frame for submissions of the initial review draft.  It is to be understood, however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.<br />4.	As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Coordinator shall act as a representative of the Commission in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in the RFP. The Research Coordinator shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.<br />5.	The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.<br />6.	At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this Request for Proposal may be posted on the Commission's website.<br />7.	Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant that it/he/she will perform this work solely for the Commission, and that the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.<br />8.	The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.<br />9.	After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the Contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's web site and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.<br />10.	A contractor will be expected to participate, as appropriate, in activities relating to the dissemination of a final report, at the discretion of the Commission. Briefing requests will be reasonable and will be subject to mutual agreement.<br />Primary Selection Criteria:<br />1.	The Commission will determine which organization or individual responding to this request will be awarded the contract based on a comprehensive "best value" analysis of the proposals received, to include costs, technical value, and ability to complete the work satisfactorily and on time.<br />2.	The primary weighting criterion in selection shall be the assessed qualifications and ability of an organization or individual to address the fundamental research points enunciated above ("key issues and questions to be addressed by the report").<br />3.	The cost and amount of time necessary to complete the report will also be considered as criteria in the selection process.<br />Proposal submissions should include:<br />1.	A statement of the applicant's relevant qualifications to satisfy the terms of this request for proposals (RFP), to include curricula vitae for personnel intended for work on the project;<br />2.	A description of the research methodology the applicant proposes to employ.  In describing methodology, the submission should provide detailed descriptions of the sources and methods that will be used to research the report's topic and the extent to which Chinese language sources, if any, and other primary materials will be used;<br />3.	An estimate of the time the applicant will need to complete the required work; <br />4.	The price the applicant will charge to the Commission to complete the work set forth in this RFP.</p>

<p>June 17, 2010</p>
<p><br />Memorandum: A Comparison of Recent Green Technology Reports vs. the USCC's RFP for Green Technology Research (USCC-016)</p>
<p>In light of the publication of recent think tank and industry reports on green technology development in China, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") has reviewed these reports and decided to modify its earlier (Feb. 9, 2010) request for proposals (RFP) accordingly.  The Commission has made the following conclusions:</p>
<p>&bull;	Industrial Policy: Taken as a group, the reports provide sufficient coverage of PRC industrial policy, and adequately illustrate the incentives (subsidies, tax breaks, protectionist policies, etc.) used to promote domestic Chinese companies over foreign competitors.  No further in-depth research on Chinese industrial policy is required, although the Commission is interested in seeing research on parallel U.S. policies to promote green technology development.</p>
<p>&bull;	Technological Developments: The reports provide information about the state of technology development in selected Chinese industries, but they do not provide comprehensive coverage in these areas. They also do not provide a comprehensive comparison of U.S./Chinese green technology developments. Also, they do not address in a comprehensive fashion the prominent companies and research institutions involved in green technology development in each country. The Commission desires further research to cover current/emerging "state of the art" in green technologies and the institutions working on them, as well as the comparative state of U.S./Chinese efforts.<br /> <br />&bull;	WTO / Trade Policies: None of the reports addresses in depth the questions on WTO commitments, trade balances, market access, etc. raised in the Commission's earlier RFP. The Commission desires to see focused research to better illuminate the trade aspects of green technology development in China and the United States.</p>
<p>&bull;	Joint Ventures &amp; Technology Transfer: Issues regarding the role of joint ventures established in China by foreign firms, and the role they may play in both technology development and technology transfer, have not been addressed in these reports. The Commission desires to see research focused on this topic.</p>
<p>The RFP accompanying this memo (Federal Business Opportunities solicitation number USCC-017, dated June 17, 2010) supersedes an earlier RFP on this topic released by the Commission (FBO solicitation number USCC-016, dated Feb. 9, 2010).</p>
<p>Questions for further clarification may be directed to Mr. John Dotson, Research Coordinator for the Commission's, via the contact data below.</p>

<SUBJECT>Research Report on China's Role in the Market for Rare Earth Minerals
<SOLNBR>USCC-018
<RESPDATE>070910
<CONTACT>John D. Dotson, Research Coordinator, Phone 2026241482, Email jdotson@uscc.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS<br />June 17th, 2010<br /> <br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />5:30 PM, July 9th, 2010<br /> <br />The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on the issues surrounding China's roles in the international market for rare earth minerals, and the resulting impacts on U.S. economic and national security.
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION.  The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the economic and national security dimensions of the United States' trade and economic ties with the PRC. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov.</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in 22 U.S.C. 7002), which states that "The Commission... shall investigate and report exclusively on... <br />ENERGY. - The effect of the large and growing economy of the People's Republic of China on world energy supplies and the role the United States can play (including joint research and development efforts and technological assistance), in influencing the energy policy of the People's Republic of China...<br />REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND SECURITY IMPACTS. - The triangular economic and security relationship among the United States, Taipei and the People's Republic of China...<br />WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION COMPLIANCE. - The compliance of the People's Republic of China with its accession agreement to the World Trade Organization (WTO)."</p>
<p>ABOUT PROPOSALS.  The Commission solicits proposals from contractors capable of providing a one-time unclassified report on the issues surrounding China's roles in the international market for rare earth minerals (REMs), and the resulting impacts on U.S. economic and national security.</p>
<p>Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:<br /> <br />1.	Identify the extent of the international market for rare earth minerals, in terms both of existing mining and processing operations, as well as untapped potential sources of supply.  Provide a comprehensive list of the identified sources for REM mining and processing throughout the world, along with identification of the specific REMs produced at each location. Identify the firm(s) involved in production at each location. Also, assess the particular factors in each country - local laws, environmental impacts, government policies towards foreign investment, etc. - that affect REM production in those areas. Identify as well sites of potential REM production that are currently unexploited, and provide at least a summary analysis as to what steps might be required to commence production at these sites. <br /> <br />2.	Identify China's overall control of the international market for rare earth minerals - i.e., what is the combined share of this market controlled by Chinese entities?  In preparing this analysis, the report shall identify and analyze the nature of the Chinese entities engaged in the mining or processing of rare earth minerals.  This analysis shall determine, to the extent practicable, the extent of government involvement, influence or financing of such operations.</p>
<p>3.	Provide a list of the major products and technologies - both civilian and military in nature - that rely upon REMs for their manufacture. To the extent possible, assess the extent of Chinese-controlled market share for each major category of these rare earth minerals. What alternative products could potentially be used in place of these REMs, and what is their current level of development and/or commercialization?</p>
<p>4.	Provide a comprehensive list of the acquisitions outside of China made by PRC entities over the past 20 years in the fields of REM mining, processing, and/or trading. As available, assess any identifiable patterns made in these deals - i.e., who are the major Chinese entities involved in these acquisitions, and what specific holdings do they control? Have certain REMs been targeted for acquisition more than others? What role, if any, does foreign capital play in these acquisitions? At a minimum, an examination of the following acquisitions or attempted acquisitions by Chinese entities should be included in this review: the purchase of Magnequench (a formerly U.S.-based manufacturer of rare earth magnets that shifted operations to China in 2002); the role of the Mountain Pass mine in the abortive 2005 purchase of Unocal; and recent acquisitions or attempted acquisitions of mining properties in Australia. Purchases or potential purchases of rare earth mining concessions in the developing world by Chinese interests are also of interest to the Commission.</p>
<p>5.	Over the past two decades, the PRC has established a commanding position in the international REM market. What are the imperatives and goals that have led the PRC to pursue this strategy of REM market dominance? What has been the extent of PRC state encouragement and support to Chinese entities making foreign acquisitions in the REM sector (in terms of diplomatic support, favorable financing arrangements, etc.)? Are there any signs that such acquisition deals may have been tied to loans, aid packages, etc. granted to other governments? Looking back over the past 20 years, is there any evidence to support claims that PRC entities may have engaged in predatory pricing with the intent to drive international competitors out of REM production (as alleged in the case of Molycorp Minerals in 2002, etc.)?</p>
<p>6.	Identify the major dependencies - in terms of both commercial and military products - that U.S. producers currently have on Chinese REM suppliers. Assess the impacts that these dependencies have, and/or could grow to have, on both U.S. military supply chain security and on the productive capacities of U.S. manufacturers. Assess, as well, the likely effects that these dependencies have on the prices for goods manufactured with REMs, and the resulting impacts on the competitiveness of U.S. firms.</p>
<p>7.	In recent years, the PRC has placed restrictions on its exports of rare earth minerals, and PRC officials have made statements in the past year indicating that REM export quotas could be tightened further. If implemented, what would be the likely impacts of these tightened export restrictions on U.S. firms? What further competitive advantages would this bestow on Chinese firms competing in emerging technology sectors heavily reliant upon REMs (electronics, communications, "green technology" manufacturing, etc.)? Also, is there any evidence to indicate that U.S. or other foreign companies may have shifted production operations to China due, at least in part, to REM export restrictions? Finally, how do such REM export quotas or other restrictions relate to China's obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization?</p>
<p>8.	Explicate and assess the steps taken by governments and firms in other countries (particularly Japan and Europe) to adapt their manufacturing practices in the face of Chinese dominance of the REM market.</p>
<p>Additional Requirements of the Commission:<br />1.	Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal Central Contractor Registry (CCR).<br />2.	Once a contractor has been selected for this project by the Commission and a contract signed, public notice of this will be made on the Commission's website. <br />3.	The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion.  In ordinary circumstances, once a contractor has been selected by the Commission and a contract signed, a draft of the report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 120 days from the date of contract confirmation.

The best value is represented by the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required. The technical area will be evaluated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. Only those quotations determined to be technically acceptable will be evaluated on price.

Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />d. Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f. Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM). <br />a. In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />b. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />c. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />d. The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />e. The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />f. The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address<br />a. All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />b. The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />a. Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />b. Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />c. Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />d. PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />e. If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />f. Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).<br />If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>
<p>CONUS ONLY 1-866-618-5988, Option 1 <br />COMMERCIAL 801-777-3282, Option 8, Option 1 <br />DSN 777-3282 Option 1 <br />FAX Commercial: 801-605-7453 DSN: 388-7543 <br />Email: cscassig@ogden.disa.mil <br />Note: Reference "WAWF" in email Subject line.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS: Any award will include DFARS Clause 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />(ii) The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-10-1068201-02.</p>
<p>(iii) This solicitation and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40. (iv) This requirement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 541519 and the small business size standard is $25M. The Government intends to issue a time and material / Labor Hour Contract for a base plus two option years. The Government reserves the right to issue an award without discussions.</p>
<p>(v) &amp; (vi): GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) is seeking qualified sources capable of Internet Monitoring and Analysis Support Services (IMSS). Please see the attached Statement of Work (SOW) and Other Terms and Conditions document for more details on this requirement (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1 titled, "Instructions to Offerors -Commercial" (JUN 2008), applies to this acquisition and is available at website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/12.htm#P257_45709. Offerors are required to submit their proposals in three separate volumes as follows:</p>
<p>Volume 1 - Technical</p>
<p>Shall include supporting documentation as attachments to the technical volume, such as resumes, project management plan, Conflict of Interest Plan, and certifications. This volume shall contain the Technical Approach and not be a reiteration of the SOW. This portion of the proposal shall exclude any reference to the pricing aspects of each offer. Offerors shall demonstrate in sufficient detail a technical approach that will meet the requirements specified in the SOW (attachment #1). The technical volume shall not exceed 25 pages and be submitted electronically in PDF format. The page limitation does not include Cover page, Table of Contents, Resumes, Certifications, Project Management plan, or Conflict of Interest Plan.</p>
<p>Volume 2- Past Performance</p>
<p>This volume shall describe the Offeror's success in performing comparable contracts/orders. The Past Performance Volume shall be no more than three pages, i.e., no more than one page narrative per contract/order and submitted electronically in PDF format. The Offeror shall submit directly to the Government:</p>
<p>A list of three contracts/orders, similar in scope, duration, and price to the work described in the SOW. The Offeror shall adhere to the following guidelines in generating this list:</p>
<p>o Contracts or orders must have been completed within three years of the quote due date. <br />o The list may include contracts/orders on which the Offeror served as a subcontractor, provided that the subcontract was similar in scope, duration, and price to this effort.<br />o The list should include both a contractual and technical point of contact (email addresses and phone numbers) for each of the contracts/orders. <br />o If a subcontract is being used as a past performance reference, contact information for the prime contractor, not the customer, should be included. <br />o The list should include the contract/order number, title (if appropriate), the period of performance, and the dollar value of the contract/order. <br />o If the contract/order is not described in the Technical Volume, the Offeror shall include a one page narrative the contract/order, describing the nature of the work performed and emphasizing outcomes reached.</p>
<p>The Offeror should also send the Past Performance Questionnaire attached to the RFP (Attachment 2) to the sources that it identifies in the Past Performance Volume. The questionnaires should be sent to the individual most knowledgeable about the Offeror's performance on the identified order or program (e.g. the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative; the Program/Project Manager; or the Contracting Officer). Each reference must complete the questionnaire and mail a hard copy to the Contract Specialist. The Offeror may opt to allow the return of completed questionnaires to the Government via electronic mail. This is solely at the discretion of the Offeror, with the understanding that e-mail systems, servers, Internet, intranets and extranets are not considered secure. The Offeror shall ensure that all the point of contacts complete and return the questionnaires to the Government prior to the RFP close date. Offerors are cautioned that the Government may use data provided by each Offeror as well as data obtained from possible other sources such as the Nation Institute of Health's (NIH) Contractor Performance System (CPS) or the Department of Defense's (DOD) Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRs) in the evaluation of past performance.<br />Government:</p>
<p>Volume 3 - Pricing Proposal</p>
<p>The completion and submission of the above items will constitute an offer (proposal) and will indicate the offeror's unconditional assent to the terms and conditions of this RFP and any attachments hereto. Alternate proposals are not authorized. Objections to any terms and conditions of the RFP will constitute deficiency, which may render the offer unacceptable. This volume shall include proposed labor categories, labor rates (fully-loaded), level-of-effort, and materials / Other Direct Costs / and Travel (if applicable) for a base plus 2 option periods. The pricing proposal shall be submitted on the attached Microsoft Excel Sheet (Attachment 3) with the cells unlocked.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition. The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals and are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>VOLUME 1 Technical Proposal</p>
<p>FACTOR 1) Technical Understanding: The proposed content will be evaluated on the ability to demonstrate that the offeror understands the technical requirements and has a coherent, feasible and efficient approach to providing the services required.</p>
<p>The proposal shall:</p>
<p>a) demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements as stated in the SOW; <br />b) specify the contractor's current infrastructure for internet monitoring and analysis support services to include any (if applicable) Commercial Off the Shelf (COTs), Government off the Shelf (GOTs), or contractor proprietary software; <br />c) present an approach to monitoring FDA Regulated Products and tracking affiliated networks; <br />d) presents an approach to reporting and notifying the FDA; <br />e) delineate a detailed and well organized project plan and staffing plan that demonstrates all aspects of the services to be performed</p>
<p>FACTOR 2) Relevant Experience</p>
<p>This section of the technical proposal shall include a written narrative describing two to four projects that are similar to this effort in terms of scope, complexity, importance to the agency's mission, and size. The proposed projects that are included in the narrative should involve internet monitoring. Projects listed may include contracts with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial customers. The narrative shall emphasize any situations in which the Offeror conducted internet monitoring, tracked affiliated networks, and monitored regulated products, such as pharmaceuticals, bilogics, vaccines, medical devices etc...</p>
<p>The technical proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, "Minimally Acceptable", "Acceptable", or "Exceptional". A score of "Minimally Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technical apprach minimally met the requirements and demonstrated to be difficult to implement. A score of "Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technical approach fully met the requirements and demonstrated its ability to be implemented. A score of "Exceptional" would mean that the proposed technical approach exceeded the requirements and would be easy to implement.</p>
<p>VOLUME 2: PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Past Performance: The FDA will evaluate past performance as a risk assessment; not as a weighted technical evaluation factor.</p>
<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offer. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that bidder's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the bidder as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a past performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offer.</p>
<p>VOLUME 3: PRICE</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a 12 month base period plus two 12 month option periods. Price is less important than technical and past performance. As proposals are rated more equal technically pricing will prevail. The FDA will evaluate the proposed labor rates and bottom-line price by making a price reasonableness determination. FDA will determine price reasonableness by utilizing one or several of the following price realism techniques: reviewing the proposed ceiling amount and labor rates against amounts and rates previously paid by the FDA for similar work, amounts previously charged by the contractor for similar work, standard market labor rates for similar labor categories, and determining whether the overall proposed level of effort / labor mix reflects the contractor's proposed technical approach and meets the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work. If applicable FDA reserves the right to review the contractor's labor rates on the General Service Administration (GSA) (if applicable) website and seek price information from other commercial and Government sources. Unrealistically low proposed prices (initially or subsequently) may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror either doesn't understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic quote.</p>
<p>FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL1990) applies to this procurement. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009). This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the above described procurement.
<p>As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, a variety of new emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines. The EPA NVFEL has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems to enhance the capabilities to conduct low level emissions testing, of the highest precision and accuracy, on a broad range of vehicles. Part of this implementation involves sharing the ground floor space for other test enclosures, which consumes the current vehicle parking area.</p>
<p>The US EPA NVFEL (National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory) in Ann Arbor, Michigan provides certification conformity tests for motor vehicles. As part of the test sequence process, vehicles are preconditioned and then parked in a temperature controlled soak area for 12-36 hours to stabilize before the emissions test is done. This soak area has 20 feet of clear height under 90" deep roof girders that are set on 10' centers. This space would enable the stacking of multiple levels of vehicles in order to optimize the storage/soak and test capacity of the limited soak floor area.</p>
<p>Standard vehicle lifts have been used in the automotive industry for this purpose. This document details the dimensions and specifications requirements for the triple lift structures that could be installed at NVFEL for this same purpose. Test vehicles are moved without starting or driving them by use of a RICO vehicle (crab) mover. The stackers system shall be designed to function and integrate with these vehicle movers in getting the vehicles on and off the stacker lift platforms. The contractor shall design, fabricate, deliver, install, and test the equipment to assure that it meets the functions specified and meets all the requirements herein.</p>
<p>The Vehicle Stacker System shall conform to the requirements specified in the procurement Scope of Work. For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project - configuration, design, fabrication, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, and training of EPA staff. The contractor shall be responsible for documenting compliance with any applicable building codes.<br />This procurement will be made using a trade-off analysis to determine the best value to the government. The applicable North American industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238290, "Vehicle Lift Installation." This procurement is being procured on a full and open competition basis. In addition to price, the Government's evaluation of proposals will address each offeror's project approach and experience and past performance. All non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price for purposes of source selection. The solicitation will be released through the internet on the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov. Prospective offerors can download the Request for Proposals and related documents from this website currently. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>

The Department of State (DOS) removed the previous www.fbo.gov posting associated with SAQMMA10R0005 for administrative convenience. DOS still considers SAQMMA10R0005 as an active solicitation and all dates and timelines including the mandatory synopsis period remain in effect. DOS will now consider requests to attend the mandatory preproposal conference received by 1:00pm EDT Monday April 26. NOTICE OF PROPOSED SOLICITATION (Posted April 15, 2010) Worldwide Protective Services (WPS) The U.S. Department of State (DOS) intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ) to up to six (6) qualified U.S. firms. DOS anticipates issuing Task and Delivery Orders under the IDIQ comprised of labor hour / day rate, firm-fixed price, and cost-reimbursement components. This IDIQ will satisfy anticipated and unanticipated personal protective, static guard, and emergency response team security service requirements worldwide. The IDIQ focuses primarily on DOS requirements in critical or higher than critical threat areas. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four, one-year option periods (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). The NAICS code for these services is 561612. At a minimum, offerors must possess ALL of the following listed below: A. A valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission for the base contract. If a firm with a valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance is selected for award of the base contract, the Government will sponsor that firm for the Top Secret Facility Clearance. However, if for whatever reason, within 60 days of contract award, the firm has not been granted an Interim Top Secret Facility Security Clearance, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract. Similarly, if for whatever reason, within 120 days of contract award, a final Top Secret Facility Security Clearance has not been granted to the contractor, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract.; and B. Have at least two years of experience in managing and operating personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security services programs located in austere and hostile environments overseas (i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc); and C. Personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security programs must have a total annual value of at least 15 million dollars; and D. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating guard forces with at least 100 positions (posts) at each location, in multiple locations (different facilities, cities, states, regions, etc.); and E. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating long term personal protective security details for executive level dignitaries; and F. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating emergency response teams comprised of at least four members. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirements contained in the statement of work for each task order awarded under the IDIQ contract. All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass background investigations conducted separately by the Contractor and the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. Depending on position, all prime and subcontractor employees performing on this contract must possess either a personnel security clearance or a moderate-risk public trust certification, or have been vetted by the Regional Security Office at the U.S. Embassy where performance is requested (for instance U.S. Embassy Baghdad or Kabul). Firms that are not eligible for a facility security clearance are NOT ELIGIBLE for award of this contract as the prime contractor, nor can they be selected as a subcontractor if the positions require a personnel security clearance for contract performance. SPECIAL NOTES: 1) All International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other legal requirements shall be met at the time of contract award. DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract of a company that is not ITAR compliant. Contractors shall submit proof of ITAR compliance at the time of contract award; and 2) DOS reserves the right to reject the proposal of any Offeror that the Government of Iraq or Afghanistan deems ineligible for a Private Security Contractor license, or that is ineligible for any reason to operate as a Private Security Contractor in Iraq or Afghanistan. Contractors shall submit proof of their legal ability to perform in any country where they are awarded work. Anticipated Acquisition Schedule DOS plans to post the complete Request for Proposal to www.fbo.gov approximately fifteen (15) days after this notice, no paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted, offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit a proposal for the IDIQ contract award along with four (4) task order proposals consisting of three (3) operational programs and a local program management office. The three operational programs include: a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Baghdad, Iraq, a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Kabul, Afghanistan, and a personal protective security service requirement in Jerusalem. DOS intends to award LPMO Task Orders concurrently to firms that are selected for award of an operational task order. Offerors who do not submit proposals for the IDIQ and all the Task Orders will not be considered by the Government for award. Offerors will also be required to submit a completely separate proposal detailing expenses to establish an LPMO in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Under this multiple award IDIQ contract, all offerors receiving awards SHALL propose 100% of the time on all task and delivery order requirements throughout the life of the contract. The Government reserves the right to terminate any contractor for default who fail to conform to this requirement. DOS anticipates contract award approximately sixty (60) to seventy-five (75) days after submission of proposals. As such, offerors shall certify that all proposals SHALL NOT EXPIRE for a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days after submission to the Government. The Question and Answer (Q &amp;A) period opens with the posting of the solicitation (and not before). The Government will allow interested parties to submit questions to the Government up to April 26, 2010; 1:30 PM EDT after the solicitation is issued.

<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<DESC>1. Industry Day is scheduled for an upcoming BAA titled <strong>"Liquid Rocket Engine Technology Development (LRETD)"</strong> on Wednesday, 30 June 2010. This BAA will include three (3) topics: <br />
<p><br />A. <strong>Green Advanced Spacecraft Propulsion (Green ASP)</strong> - AFRL's object of this program is to develop a thruster that will accommodate increased temperature and oxidation product environments to deliver predictable performance. Associated life and delivered thrust scaling as well as degradation algorithms are sought to support predictability of performance. AFRL is pursuing increased delivered energy density, decreased toxicity spacecraft chemical propulsion to support development and deployment of smaller logistical footprint, more easily deployable and mission capable spacecraft. AFRL has developed increased energy density, decreased toxicity monopropellant formulations relative to the current state of the art; however, the combustion environments are more demanding than state of the art propellants due to the increase in combustion temperature and oxidative product formation. Correspondingly, thruster component temperature and oxidation resistance requirements have increased relative to the state of the art as well. Thruster development to date, specific to AFRL developed advanced monopropellant formulations, has emphasized catalytic ignition. Development work has been focused upon a specific AFRL-developed monopropellant formulation applied to thruster design and support system (tanks, valves, regulators, control components, etc.) primarily for satellite missions. The desired conclusion of this program is a relevant demonstration of flight-like optimized components and of relevant mission duty cycles that support a flight-weight propulsion system design with defined performance and lifetime attributes. To achieve this end, the program design will rely on a phased approach 1) to understand thruster component materials requirements defined by combustion environment, degradation behavior, etc., and initialize algorithms describing these, 2) to map out delivered performance in a basic thruster configuration and derive initial scaling and degradition algorithms there from, 3) to optimize light-weight thruster development, to test performance and to validate developed algorithms, 4) and to demonstrate program performance goals and design for a proto-flight propulsion unit with supporting data analysis.</p>
<p>B. <strong>Health Assessment and Recognition Tools (HART)</strong> - The purpose of this topic is to solicit proposals for the development of innovative technologies in the field of liquid rocket engine health management. More specifically, the purpose of this topic is to develop sensors and sensor data algorithms that will enable oxygen-rich staged-combustion cycle reusable booster engines to achieve the Air Force operability goal for engine turnaround time. Solutions of particular interest include those that reduce or eliminate time-consuming ground inspections and/or maintenance actions. This topic has two (2) areas of interest; Turbopump Assembly (TPA) Application and Thrust Chamber Assembly (TCA) Application.</p>
<p><br />C. <strong>Propulsion Unit for Cubesats (PUC)</strong> - Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards AFB is interested in developing a propulsion module for precision maneuvering of very small spacecraft. Spacecraft typified by the emerging "cubesat" standard may provide a new paradigm for responsive spacecraft. Spacecraft with stowed volumes of between 1,000 cm3 and 3,000 cm3 massing approximately 3 kg for a variety of missions are advantageous for a variety of Air Force missions. One significant drawback of present cubesat technology is the lack of capable primary propulsion. Recent analysis performed at AFRL has determined that it is possible to increase total impulse capability dramatically over current state-of-the-art while remaining within a 1,000 cm3 envelope. Technologies of interest include both low and high thrust propulsion technologies.</p>

ESOC West will be one of two production data centers that will house all of the Departments production servers up to the Secret classification level.  This acquisition will provide backup servers for the virtual infrastructure to host those production applications.  The servers will serve as backups to the blade servers that function as the primary support of the virtual infrastructure.. 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Paragraph (c) provides for use of a brand name procurement.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as key components of the ESOC West IT infrastructure.  This purchase is one of several to replicate the Departments existing ESOC East IT infrastructure.  Question 3 above addresses the historical background of this issue more fully.The requirement will be completed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Alternative Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Public Meeting

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting a review of alternative positioning, navigation, and timing (APNT) capabilities that support communication, navigation, and surveillance applications for aviation within the U.S. in the event of a loss of Global Navigation Satellite Services (GNSS).  The FAA currently provides APNT services through a variety of non-GNSS legacy navigation systems including Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR), Instrument Landing System (ILS) and radar surveillance.
The FAA is considering the future need for APNT services to ensure that operations are appropriately supported, consistent with the evolution to the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  NextGen will require an increased level of minimum APNT performance from what legacy systems currently provide.  Therefore, the FAA is collecting information regarding research, development and potential implementation of systems, avionics, processes, and procedures that minimize the impact to system capacity and efficiency during periods of GNSS interference.
In order to exchange information with the aviation industry, the FAA will hold a public meeting on August 10, 11, and 12 in Stanford, CA.  The purpose of the meeting is to 1) share the current FAA perspective on future APNT requirements and 2) solicit input from the community on the perceived requirements and potential APNT solutions that support NextGen.  The tentative agenda items include:
1.	FAA presentations on anticipated APNT assumptions and requirements2.	Airspace user presentations on operator requirements (airline, business aviation, general aviation)3.	Avionics manufacturers' presentations on capabilities that may be available in support of NextGen.4.	Ground infrastructure manufacturers' presentations on systems and design that can support APNT.
Seating is limited and therefore on a first-come-first-serve basis.  Interested parties should RSVP as soon as possible to the individuals listed below, but not later than 4:00 pm local time July 30, 2010.  Additional information including a detailed agenda and meeting logistics will be provided to those responding to this announcement. 
At the meeting, airspace users are encouraged to present their envisioned requirements for APNT in NextGen.  Participants representing the manufacturing industry are encouraged to present concepts and technical data that explain how the FAA can provide APNT services that affordably minimize the impact of a localized GNSS interference event.  Presentations should specifically address the issues surrounding the operational need to continue navigation and surveillance during a GNSS interference event.  If alternative implementations are envisioned for different classes of aircraft/users, these alternatives should be clearly described.  
A limited number of 30-minute closed-door sessions between manufacturers and the FAA's APNT team will be available for the purpose of exchanging proprietary information during the meeting.  Manufacturers interested in setting up a session should make their request at the time of the RSVP.  Interested parties are also invited to submit a summary of their planned presentation to the FAA in the form of a report (via email in .pdf format) by July 30, 2010.  Please limit the summary to five pages.  All submissions received by the FAA will be treated as proprietary information unless otherwise requested by the individual submitter.

<DESC>Price Range:<br />FAR 36.203 - Government estimate of construction costs. <br />FAR 36.204 - Disclosure of the magnitude of construction projects.<br />(d) Between $250,000 and $500,000.
<p>The site visit took place on 6/16/10 at 9AM local at the Madison Ranger District Office in Ennis, MT. Three representatives (one each) from KM Trucking, Huffaker's Excavation and Swiss Precision were present as well as four FS representatives. Approximately 4-5 of the 17 miles outside the wilderness boundary were reviewed by the group. It was noted at the site visit, however, that it is extremely important that those wishing to bid this project walk the entire trail and reroute sections prior to submitting a bid to gain a full appreciation and understanding of the difficulty of the work at hand. Several portions are extremely rocky, with several switchbacks. It was also noted that airlifting stringers to the bridge site may be the only means to get those materials to the site. The Forest Service does plan to freshen the staking/flagging on the project site. FAR 52.236-3, Site Investigations and Conditions Affecting the Work, will be included in any contract awarded as a result of the solicitation. This clause states:</p>
<p><em>(a) The Contractor acknowledges that it has taken steps reasonably necessary to ascertain the nature and location of the work, and that it has investigated and satisfied itself as to the general and local conditions which can affect the work or its cost, including but not limited to (1) conditions bearing upon transportation, disposal, handling, and storage of materials; (2) the availability of labor, water, electric power, and roads; (3) uncertainties of weather, river stages, tides, or similar physical conditions at the site; (4) the conformation and conditions of the ground; and (5) the character of equipment and facilities needed preliminary to and during work performance. The Contractor also acknowledges that it has satisfied itself as to the character, quality, and quantity of surface and subsurface materials or obstacles to be encountered insofar as this information is reasonably ascertainable from an inspection of the site, including all exploratory work done by the Government, as well as from the drawings and specifications made a part of this contract. Any failure of the Contractor to take the actions described and acknowledged in this paragraph will not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for estimating properly the difficulty and cost of successfully performing the work, or for proceeding to successfully perform the work without additional expense to the Government. <br />(b) The Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the Contractor based on the information made available by the Government. Nor does the Government assume responsibility for any understanding reached or representation made concerning conditions which can affect the work by any of its officers or agents before the execution of this contract, unless that understanding or representation is expressly stated in this contract. <br /></em><br />A bid bond will be required on this project in an amount equal to 20% of the bid price or $100,000, whichever is less, per FAR 52.228-1.&nbsp; There were no other pertinent questions that would not be answered by the solicitation when it is posted to FBO. Currently the Forest Service is awaiting affirmation on the remainder of funding for this project. The expectation is that this will be in place by the end of June 2010. Additional technical questions can be answered by contacting Kendra Bull at (406) 683-3962.</p>

<a href="mailto:mike.v.brown@us.army.mil">USPFO for Pennsylvania</a>
<DESC>This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.  POINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS MR. MICHAEL V. BROWN.  SUBMIT QUESTIONS VIA E-MAIL TO:  mike.v.brown@us.army.mil. The NAICS code is 541330 Engineering Services.  The size standard is $4.5 Million.  This action is being undertaken in accordance with the Architectural & Engineering provisions of FAR Part 36 and DFARS Part 236.  This announcement is being issued on an unrestricted basis and is for the selection of Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Firms for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Air National Guard / Pennsylvania Army National Guard).  Contracting Officers outside of the United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) for Pennsylvania may issue Delivery Orders for A-E Services to support other State and Federal Agencies throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Firms must be capable of concurrently responding to and working on multiple projects.  Selection of Firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services, as more fully set forth in the selection criteria.  All Firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR Part 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest; and FAR 36.209  Construction contracts with architect-engineer firms.  Large Firms, if selected, will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS subpart 219.7 as part of any Request for Proposal package.  The subcontracting plan is NOT required with the Firms SF 330.<BR><BR>SCOPE OF SERVICES:  The United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) for Pennsylvania intends to award one or more (multiple awards may be made) Firm Fixed-Price performance based Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Air National Guard / Pennsylvania Army National Guard).  Each A-E IDIQ contract will be established for a base period of one (1) year with options exercisable for four (4) successive one (1) year option periods.  A contract minimum of $1,000 and a cumulative $10 Million ceiling will apply for the duration of each contract with no limit on individual delivery order amounts.  Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Orders are anticipated to be awarded against the A-E IDIQ contracts.  Contracting Officers outside of the USPFO for Pennsylvania will be able to issue Delivery Orders for A-E Services to support National Guard and other State and Federal Agencies throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The Government anticipates that this announcement will result in the award of up to four (4) contracts to provide services to each of four (4) primary locations:  (LOCATION 1 - 171st ARW, Pittsburgh IAP; LOCATION 2 - 193rd SOW, Harrisburg IAP; LOCATION 3 - 111th FW, Willow Grove ARS; and LOCATION 4 - PAARNG, Fort Indiantown Gap); in addition to supporting locations/activities on a statewide basis.  Accordingly, each contract will cover a Location, but may also result in the issuance of task orders for locations/activities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  By making a submission for a Location, the submitting Firm acknowledges that task orders may be issued for other locations throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Interested Firms must indicate the Location(s) for which they are submitting.  Since proximity of a Firms office for its project team and its knowledge of the locality as it pertains to design and construction methods of military projects in the geographic area where anticipated work will be accomplished is an evaluation factor, interested Firms submitting for more than one Location must make multiple submissions with the Firms office location and key project team tailored to each Location.  The A-E IDIQ contracts that are anticipated to be awarded will each be for an initial base year period with four (4) one year option periods.  Individual Delivery Orders anticipated to be issued under the A-E IDIQ contract may include Delivery Orders under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Firms are advised that under such circumstances RECOVERY Act reporting requirements and contract clauses will be applicable to the Delivery Orders. The Architectural and Engineering Services for which Delivery Orders may be issued may include: a). Design of new facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; b). Rehabilitation of existing facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; c). Design of projects on Army or Air Force installations; d). Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria; e). Sustainable design utilizing LEED rating tools; f). Preparation of the development of the technical information for design-build Request for Proposals; g).  Development of construction cost estimates and schedules; h). Design of Demolition; i). Comprehensive planning that is related to future construction requirements on military installations; and j) Construction phase services including commissioning, shop drawing review and preparation of O&M manuals.  <BR><BR>EVALUATION:  The Governments selection of the best value contractor(s) is based upon an integrated assessment of the below factors / selection criteria in descending order of importance (unless otherwise stated) to determine the most highly qualified firm(s).  Each factor will be assigned a rating from Exceptional to Unacceptable, based on the risk to the government that the firm will successfully perform the contract in view of the factor being evaluated.  An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission.  Factors listed will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows:  SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT  meaning that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor; MORE IMPORTANT  meaning that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater; EQUAL  meaning that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor.  FACTOR 1 - Personnel (Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services)  evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the project team.  Firms should provide information for one to three individuals from each design discipline that is anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the project team.  The key positions should include:  Project Managers; Quality Assurance Managers; Architects; Structural Engineers; Civil Engineers; Mechanical Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Fire Protection Engineers; Geotechnical Engineers; Environmental Engineers; and Land Surveyors.  Firms may provide information on other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in the SCOPE OF SERVICES.  FACTOR 2 - Specialized Experience and Technical Competence  evaluates the experience of the Firm and project team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for the AE IDIQ Contract(s).  FACTOR 3 - Past Performance (previous 5 years)  evaluates the Firms performance on contracts with Government Agencies and Private Industry in terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules.  FACTOR 4  Work Management (capability to accomplish work in the required time)  evaluates the ability of the Firm to, given its current projected workload and the availability of key personnel, to accomplish a project(s) within required time periods.  FACTOR 5  Firm Location & Locality Knowledge (Location of project office in general geographical proximity to one of the following:  (a) LOCATION 1 - 171st ARW, Pittsburgh IAP, (b) LOCATION 2 - 193rd SOW, Harrisburg IAP, (c) LOCATION 3 - 111th FW, Willow Grove ARS, or (d) LOCATION 4 - PAARNG, Fort Indiantown Gap; and knowledge of the identified locality)  evaluates both the distance of the Firms project office from the LOCATION and the extent of the Firms knowledge of the LOCATION and knowledge/experience concerning state, county and local requirements for projects of the types anticipated for the A-E IDIQ Contract(s).  FACTOR 6 - Volume of Department of Defense (DoD) Awards (during the preceding twelve (12) months)  in the interest of equitable distribution of work, evaluates the volume of DoD work awarded during the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this announcement.  FACTOR 7  Small Business Participation  evaluates the degree to which a Firm identifies and commits to the use of small business concerns as prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner.  FACTORS 1 & 2 are each weighted EQUAL and are each, individually, MORE IMPORTANT than FACTOR 3, 4 & 5 which are each weighted EQUAL.  FACTORS 1 & 2 are also SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT than FACTORS 6 & 7 which are weighted EQUAL and which will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are otherwise essentially technically equal.  Relative to FACTOR 5  Location & Locality Knowledge, it is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office.  The Source Selection will consider the performance risk associated when a firms project team(s) is not co-located in the same office.<BR>  <BR>SUBMISSION FORMAT:  Three (3) completed and bound paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format on CD are required for each submission.  A separate response (SF 330) MUST be submitted for each LOCATION for which the submitting Firm wants to be considered AND clearly identify the LOCATION.

<DESC>Amendment 4 is posted. The date specified for receipt of offerors is changed to July 13, 2010. The receipt time remains unchanged at 2:00 p.m., Eastern Prevailing Time.<br /><br />Amendment 3 is posted with attachments. <br /><br />Amendment 2 Posted without links. Proceed to Amendment 3. <br /><br />PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY &amp; PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS DEVELOPED FOR CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES <br />The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the Division of Cancer Treatment, Diagnosis and Centers (DCTDC) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to re-compete a requirement currently being performed under contracts N01CM42200, N01CM42201, N01CM42202, N01CM42203, and N01CM42204. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541712. DTP is seeking organizations to carry out pharmacology and toxicology studies, the data from which must be suitable for filing with the Food and Drug Administration as part of Investigational New Drug Applications. The organizations should have the facilities and staff to carry out such studies and the management expertise to analyze and evaluate the data.
<p>Multiple contracts will be awarded and each will be administered on a work assignment-managed basis. Work assignments will be issued under the "funded cost-reimbursement, multiyear" contracts resulting from this solicitation. Assignments are estimated to involve two to three chemical agents annually, per contract The objectives of the work assignments in relative order of importance are: 1) assessment of acute and subacute toxicity in rodents and dogs including determination of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), schedule-dependent toxicity, of the reversibility of adverse effects and of a safe clinical starting dose; 2) validation of analytical methodology to quantitate plasma drug levels in preclinical animal models and to measure plasma drug levels in rodents, dogs and/or non-human primates treated with the agent under study; 3) determination of bioavailability of drug after parenteral and/or oral administration, if efficacious drug levels can be attained in plasma in vivo and if the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier; 4) the use of pharmacokinetic information to permit extrapolation of toxic effects across species by relating plasma drug levels to the time of appearance and severity of toxicity; and to establish the safety of potentially efficacious doses.</p>
<p>The Principal Investigator should have a doctoral degree in pharmacology/ toxicology plus at least five years experience in directing, implementing and evaluating drug toxicity studies in experimental animals. The Pathologist, Pharmacokineticist and Analytical Chemist should likewise have credentials that illustrate their competence and accomplishments in serving as critical team members in the conduct of such studies.</p>
<p>The government anticipates multiple awards of multiyear contracts with increments of funding. <br /><br />Mandatory Qualification/Mandatory Exclusion Criteria:</p>
<p>The GLP qualification must be met at the time of submission of the initial proposal. Since the toxicology studies will be used by the National Cancer Institute to satisfy the safety testing requirement of the Food and Drug Administration in the submission of an Investigational New Drug Application, the studies must be conducted and the data must be stored in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice Regulations as outlined in the Federal Register Friday, December 22, 1978.</p>
<p>The NCI also signs legally binding agreements with certain suppliers (often pharmaceutical or chemical companies) which state that all information on the compounds submitted by the supplier must be held confidential. The Contractor will be expected to evaluate the toxicity of such commercially confidential (discreet) materials. Therefore, the Contractor must be willing to sign a Confidentiality of Information Agreement at the time of award.</p>
<p>Mandatory Exclusion Criterion</p>
<p>The Offeror may not be a pharmaceutical, chemical, or biotechnology firm. For purposes of this RFP, a pharmaceutical, chemical or Biotechnology Company is defined as an organization which sells drugs and/or chemicals to the general public for profit or is engaged in research leading to such products.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires that prior to awarding of funds for contracts involving the use or intended use of animals in research; an acceptable assurance statement must be on file with the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR).</p>
<p>REPORTS AND DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: Draft Study Report, Final Study Report, Monthly Technical Progress Report, Annual Technical Progress Report, and Final Report.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is five years (4/1/2011 through 3/31/2016).</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought notification for commercial services prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 10, utilizing FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research. <br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.<br /><br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure operations and management support services to support resolution of NBS accounting and budget issues that may negatively impact the NIH NBS funds control implementation on behalf of the National Institutes of Health. <br />Title: NBS Support Services<br />BACKGROUND
<p>More than a decade ago, National Institutes of Health (NIH) was one of the first Federal agencies to consider the use of commercial enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to support Federal financial management. At the time, NIH realized that it needed to retire its then decades-old Core Accounting System (CAS) and the Administrative Database (ADB), for inventory, procurement, property management, travel, human resources and central accounting. In spite of the systems' ability to handle transactions at NIH, the systems were becoming obsolete and had to be replaced.</p>
<p>In 1999, NIH began developing the business case for the Oracle-based system that is now the NIH Business Systems or NBS. After significant planning efforts and securing funding for the project, NBS implementation began, module by module. The system now provides tremendous capability and functionality to serve the needs of its customers in the NIH Office of the Director (OD) and across its 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs).</p>
<p>Although NBS now serves as the system of record for the many transactions produced at NIH each day, vision for the system has yet to be fully achieved. Enhancements to the system, its environment and the financial management practices in use at NIH require renewed efforts to develop the world class management capabilities needed to support the world's leading medical research institution. At present, legacy systems are still in use and must be retired to eliminate redundancies, minimize costs and improve financial management and internal control. Other systems within NIH and at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) have yet to have their financial transaction integrated with NBS. For example, the agency's electronic Research Administration (eRA) Information for Management, Planning, Analysis and Coordination (IMPAC II) system, which processes 55,000 grant funding transactions each year, is operated by the Office of Extramural Research (OER). Failure to integrate financial aspects of this the system with NBS perpetuates weaknesses in financial controls for the nearly $25 billion in grants payments made each year. The addition of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding - nearly $10.5 billion at NIH - has significantly increased the amount of grant funding, the number of grant payments processed and the risk associated with having a grants management system that does not have its financial transactions directly integrated with NBS.</p>
<p>Enhancements to the system, its environment and the financial management practices in use at NIH require renewed efforts to develop the world class management capabilities needed to support the world's leading medical research institution. These enhancements are now planned as a series of projects collectively known as the NIH Healthier Financial Management Initiatives (HFMI).</p>
<p>Recently, several driving factors have converged on the NBS Program, which together call on the NBS Program Office to pragmatically consider a number of major financial management initiatives:</p>
<p>Audit findings have noted that the NIH continues to operate NBS without systemic funds checking enabled. Thus, the NBS Program must implement funds checking to prevent Anti-Deficiency Act violations, comply with emerging OMB and treasury requirements and ensure audit compliance.</p>
<p>Congress has required NIH to institute reprogramming controls at the sub-mechanism level. The 2010 Congressional appropriation defined funds control/funds management requirements for NIH. The language requires funds control at the sub-mechanism level, which is a component of the NBS Account Code Structure (ACS) that is not fully enabled for NIH in that the sub-mechanism values have not been fully created or used consistently in account combinations. NIH is currently in conversation with the Appropriations Committee to set the time line for achieving business process and accounting system reprogramming controls. The efforts in this current project will consider this evolving situation and ensure that decisions in system development advance (or at a minimum do not hinder) NIH's capability to implement Congressionally directed controls.</p>
<p>Under combined resources from the 2009 economic stimulus funding (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) and the annual appropriations provided for NBS activities, NIH determined that enhancing the integration of its independent grant and accounting enterprise systems could address these driving factors and significantly improve enterprise operations and support national goals of greater governmental transparency.</p>
<p>This improvement effort consists of a group of interrelated projects referred to as the NIH Healthier Financial Management Integration (HFMI). HFMI consists of the following projects.</p>
<p>o Funds Control - Implement funds management functionality to achieve Anti-deficiency Act compliance)<br />o MAS Retirement - Retire MAS/CAN Maintenance <br />o Grants Integration - Integrate financial aspects of IMPACII-NBS</p>
<p>o Strategies for implementing the Common Government-wide Accounting Classification (CGAC)<br />o Integrate Payment Management System (PMS) with NBS<br />o Implement Oracle Projects<br />o Integrate Payroll-NBS</p>
<p>The HFMI design, development and implementation was procured under a separate contract and is not part of this requirement. This effort is intended to resolve accounting and budget issues that could hamper the implementation of these initiatives.<br />Specific Tasks</p>
<p>Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide expert Information Technology Professional Services to the NIH Business System (NBS) Project for systems analysis, design, programming, conversion and implementation support. These services relate specifically to the analysis and resolution of existing NBS accounting issues identified in NIH Remedy Help Desk System that could negatively impact NIH ability to institute full systemic funds control to begin FY2011 and/or close/open the books for FY2010/2011. <br /><br />DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED</p>

<DESC>Naval Aviation Test &amp; Evaluation University (NATEU)<br />INDUSTRY DAY - 21 May 2010<br />Formal Questions and Responses<br />Solicitation N00421-10-R-1046
<p>Question 1:</p>
<p>"Can you please advise as to whether there is an incumbent contractor for this requirement? If so, could you please provide the contractor name and the contract number that was awarded?"</p>
<p>Answer: There is not an incumbent contractor, therefore a contractor name and contract number is not applicable.</p>
<p>Question 2:</p>
<p>"Can you confirm whether this solicitation is still a SDVOSB set-aside, or is it now subject to full and open competition?"</p>
<p>Answer: Pending Small Business concurrence, this procurement will not be a small business set aside of any type. This procurement will be a full and open competition.</p>
<p>Question 3:</p>
<p>"When will the Industry Day brief be posted?"</p>
<p>Answer: The NATEU Industry Day brief was posted on 5/21/2010 on the FedBizOpps and NAVAIR websites.</p>
<p>Question 4:</p>
<p>"When will the Industry Day Questions and Answers be posted?"</p>
<p>Answer: The NATEU Industry Day Questions and Answers will be posted on or about 6/08/2010 on the FedBizOpps and NAVAIR websites.</p>
<p>Question 5:</p>
<p>"Would you consider teaming arrangements?"</p>
<p>Answer: Yes</p>
<p>Question 6:</p>
<p>A. "With so many facets leading you to your desired end state, why limit yourself to a single award contract - why not leverage the benefits of a MAC?"</p>
<p>Answer: It is a fundamental part of this contract to have continuity and an overarching strategic level management. It would be difficult to mange without a single line of accountability. We believe it is not in the Government's best interest even for cost purposes.</p>
<p>B. "Have you considered leveraging the training policies and processes in place at NETC?"</p>
<p>Answer: No, there are numerous DOD policies and instructions that will need to be pursued in multiple venues.</p>
<p>C. "Navy ILE is not yet mentioned, is/will any consideration be given?"</p>
<p>Answer: Unable to answer, not familiar with NAVY ILE.</p>
<p>D. "Have you considered AIM II/CPM's planned evolution as a training management system?"</p>
<p>Answer: Not specifically, it would be part of the strategy to come up with right system.</p>
<p>Question 7:</p>
<p>A. "Has thought been given to a Multiple Award Contract?"</p>
<p>Answer: It is a fundamental part of this contract to have continuity and an overarching strategic level management. It would be difficult to mange without a single line of accountability. We believe it is not in the Government's best interest even for cost purposes.</p>
<p>B. "What would be your misgivings?"</p>
<p>Answer: It is a fundamental part of this contract to have continuity and an overarching strategic level management. It would be difficult to mange without a single line of accountability. We believe it is not in the Government's best interest even for cost purposes.</p>
<p>Question 8:</p>
<p>"Since there are many technical experts spread over majority of companies in the area, have you considered an omnibus multiple award strategy?" If a single award, you may not be able to get to many folks that particularly could help with the training courses.</p>
<p>Answer: It is a fundamental part of this contract to have continuity and an overarching strategic level management. It would be difficult to mange without a single line of accountability. We believe it is not in the Government's best interest even for cost purposes.</p>
<p>Question 9:</p>
<p>"What does the incumbent contractor currently do with respect to the proposed tasking?"</p>
<p>Answer: There is not an incumbent for this requirement.</p>
<p>Question 10:</p>
<p>A. "Anticipated connection to DAU, PGS, etc?"</p>
<p>Answer: Collaboration with other required training venues for more effective instruction. Thus, building a T&amp;E training continuum and partnering for feedback with each other would be ideal.</p>
<p>B. "Anticipated partnership with NSN TPS and USAR TPS, etc?"</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, along with other vendors (i.e. University of Kansas).</p>
<p>C. "Anticipated connection to OPTEV FOR?"</p>
<p>Answer: Exchange program.</p>
<p>D. "Schoolhouse anticipated to be part of contract cost, outside Government facilities, all three sites?"<br />Answer: No MILCON, it is part of the contract to find training facilities at all sites.</p>
<p>E. "Number of courses during first year?"</p>
<p>Answer: To be determined. It will depend on finances, strategy, and bandwidth.</p>
<p>F. "Number of anticipated student body in first year?"</p>
<p>Answer: To be determined. It will depend on finances, strategy, and bandwidth.</p>
<p>G. "Industry (OEM &amp; CSS) allowed to attend these courses?"</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, that is part of the plan.</p>
<p>Question 11:</p>
<p>A. "What percentages do you see between education and training? Education being theories, concepts, and ways to think. Training being focused on skills; "how to do."</p>
<p>Answer: 50/50 or 60/40.</p>
<p>B. "What place do you see for distributed learning/on-line training?"</p>
<p>Answer: To be determined. Optimally, to strike a balance between in-class dynamics/dialogue (war stories) vice individual/independent learning.</p>
<p>C. "How do you capture the expert knowledge of senior professionals?"</p>
<p>Answer: Subject matter experts (SME) panels, actual instructors, and the course development itself.</p>
<p>D. "Will developing a program for this be part of the contract?"</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>E. "What are your small business goals for this contract?"</p>

In order to carry out their mission, CLDP relies on the logistical capabilities of contractors to setup, coordinate, organize, and handle all the administrative events related tasks that go into putting on conferences, workshops, training seminars, programs, etc. for the CLDP at locations worldwide. <br /><br />U.S. small businesses shall have (and be able to provide proof in the form of income statements or balance sheets and/or letter of credit from financial institutions, etc.) the financial resources to provide logistical support to the Government upfront (i.e. for travel tickets, passports, visa fees, hotel rooms for non-government employees and conference attendees for the duration of the conference, per diem allowances for non-government employees, and conference attendees for the duration of the conference, and ground transportation, rental and leasing fees, printing fees, etc.) before being reimbursed in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act. These reimbursable costs could reach up to $500,000.00 per project on multiple projects awarded to the vendor.</p>
<p>U.S. small businesses planning on proposing for this requirement shall be required to list contracts and subcontracts they have held over the past five years for the same or similar work.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce plans to issue the solicitation on or about Tuesday, June 22, 2010 by uploading the solicitation as an attachment to this Synopsis. No questions will be answered concerning this requirement until the release of the solicitation.</p>
<p>THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF ANY EXPENSES INCURRED BY INTERESTED OFFERORS SUBMITTING (OR CONTEMPLATING SUBMITTING) PROPOSALS FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Change 1:<br /><br />The purpose of this&nbsp;change is to state that the Synopsis was posted on May 6, 2010 with an archive date of June 12, 2010. The Synopsis has now been posted for four weeks. The solicitation has not yet been issued. However, the solicitation's release date is planned for on or about June 16, 2010.<br /><br /></p>

<DESC><p>Description<br /><br />The work ordered under this contract may be performed in any Government-owned building or Government-leased space within Richmond, Charlottesville, Harrisonburg, Lynchburg, Danville, Norfolk, and Portsmouth, in the Commonwealth of Virginia including but not limited to repairs, alterations, renovations and modernization of buildings or portions thereof. This will be an indefinite quantity term construction contract for projects ranging from approximately $500 to $100,000. The Government intends on selecting a minimum of two (2) contractors and a maximum of four (4) contractors for said contract. The exact number of awardees will be determined by the Source Selection Team during the evaluation of proposals and will be based primarily on the number, location, and capabilities of the highest rated firms as well as GSA's anticipated workload over the term of the contract.<br /><br />This solicitation is being issued as a small business set-aside. It is the Government's intent to make an award of this solicitation to an 8(a) Firm, a Disabled Veteran Owned Firm and a Very Small Business. If, after receipt and evaluation of proposals, GSA determines that an award to a Woman Owned, a Disabled Veteran Owned, or a Very Small Business cannot be made based on not meeting the requirements outlined in this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to make an award based on the submissions received and within the established competitive range. If, after receipt and evaluation of all proposals, GSA determines that between 2 and 4 awards cannot be made to small business firms that meet all of the requirements outlined in this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reissue this requirement under full and open competition. The estimated annual dollar value of all of the projects that will be issued under the multiple term contracts can be found by applying the contractor's offer percentage to the government estimate total. The maximum limitation per year shall be 150% of the awarded offer price. Individual delivery orders may be competed among the selected firms under the contract unless the Government deems otherwise for a specific delivery order. The proposed performance period is a total of 5 years, consisting of 1 base year, with the possibility of four (1) year option periods. This requirement is being set aside for small business concerns under NAICS Code 236220 and the Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 million.&nbsp;Copy of the request for proposal solicitation is available only through FedBizOpps.gov. Telephone requests will not be accepted.&nbsp;Proposals will be due approximately&nbsp;Monday, June 28, 2010,&nbsp;4:30 pm Eastern Time.&nbsp;There will be no public opening of offers.

The RFP will be requesting the offerors bid known supplies, training and travel as part of their proposed costs, so this CLIN will only be used on a limited basis. This procurement is a follow-on to the current sole source 8(a) award CPFF IDIQ contract for the FGA BOS which expires on September 30, 2009. The contract will support Fort Greely Alaska Garrison and agencies which collaborate with them on base support and missions in support of the warfighter. USASMDC/ARSTRAT anticipates that one contract will be competitively awarded as a result of this 100% 8(a) set-aside. The resultant contract will have the capacity to provide base operation support to FGA and their tenants and shall support the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements, which include, but are not limited to: MDA Lodging and Housekeeping, Fire Alarm Maintenance, Custodial, Indoor and Outdoor Pest Control, Access Control Services for MDC, Environmental, Engineering, Refuse Removal Transport and Disposal, MDA Facilities Maintenance, and Visitors Center. Offerors will not bid on the draft PWS at this time. PWS Chapters 15 30 services are slated to be in-sourced with Department of Army Civilians. If transition plan is delayed, the Contractor may be requested to provide these services to be determined. The Contractor will not provide costs for these transition services in the final solicitation. These chapters are merely for scope purposes, should the services be necessary. The transition services are: Automation and Network Support, Human Resources Support, Food Services, Logistic Support, Centralized Dispatch, Resource Management Administrative and Analyst, Single Soldier Housing (SSH) Support, Safety Operations Support, Snow Removal, Grounds Maintenance, Allen Army Airfield Operations and Services, Facilities Support/Service Order Repair (Garrison), Religious Support, Garrison Protocol Support, Strategic Planning Support, and Directorate of Public Works Business Operations. When posted, the draft PWS, draft solicitation, applicable attachments and exhibits, and other historical FGA BOS documents and related information will be posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI). An initial round of one-on-one meetings were held with industry on February 3 and 4, 2009. These one-on-one meetings were held as a market research mechanism to help determine best commercial practices, to maximize competition, and achievement of cost efficiencies in the acquisition process. Questions and answers related to the one-on-one sessions and the draft PWS were not posted or released; however, recommendations that the Government considered relevant were incorporated into the solicitation. A draft solicitation and associated supporting documents will be posted to FedBizOps in a follow-on notice. At that time industry will be provided the opportunity to review the draft documents and specific instructions for providing comments/feedback. The final RFP will be posted to the ASFI after consideration and incorporation of relevant feedback/comments. All interested parties are encouraged to regularly monitor the website for all pertinent acquisition information ASFI will be the only official means for FGA BOS information dissemination. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 561210 and the small business size standard $35.5M. The resultant contract will establish a basic and six one-year ordering periods starting on September 30, 2009 and ending on September 30, 2016.<br /><br />2. Draft solicitation W91260-09-R-0001 is posted, with attachments, for industry review. Interested offerors are encouraged to provide comments and/or recommendations about the draft solicitation and attachments. All documents are drafts and may not be complete. The CDRLs, DD254, and Government Property Appendices are not included at this time. However, as documents are refined, they will be posted via amendment. Included in the attachments is a draft PWS Question and Answer document. Also, an amendment will be forthcoming with the redacted current contract and contract modifications. Please send comments and/or recommendations by email to both James McLaughlin, Contract Specialist at james.mclaughlin@smdc-cs.army.mil, and Kathleen B.

Disregard any Sources Sought, Presolicitation or Draft Solicitation citations on or within this posting.&nbsp; Since the solicitation number was used for the sources sought and presolicitation notice synopses, the only way to post the final solicitation notice was to mod/amend onto the previous synopses. This posting will reattach final Request for Proposal (RFP), final solicitation attachments and final Performance Work Statement (PWS) appendices. These documents will be used to prepare the proposal.
<p>1. Request proposal for a single source hybrid Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) type contract with Time-and-Materials and Cost Reimbursement Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) for Fort Greely Alaska (FGA) Base Operations Support (BOS).

<p>2. The contract will support Fort Greely Alaska Garrison and agencies which collaborate with them on base support and missions in support of the war fighter.

<p>3. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 561210 and the small business size standard $35.5M. The resultant contract will establish a one year basic period and six one-year ordering periods starting on September 30, 2009 and ending on September 29, 2016.</p>

<DESC>The Avionics Department (AIR-4.5) is procuring engineering and technical support services (ETSS) for programs within, and supported by, the Special Surveillance Programs Office (SSPO). The SSPO develops advanced sensors (Acoustics, Electro-Optical, Radar, Magnetics, and other special sensors) and persistent surveillance systems. The purpose of these sensors and surveillance systems is to support a variety of OCONUS Contingency Operations (OCO) missions for persistent surveillance. The SSPO is also responsible for rapid turn-around research, development, and prototyping to demonstrate advanced sensors/payloads for persistent surveillance. Engineering and technical support services are required to assist the SSPO in providing rapid, affordable, limited quantity procurement (LQP) of select Navy airborne and land-based systems. These systems include small and medium sized autonomous airborne surveillance systems such as Arrow, Aerosonde, Scan Eagle, Mako, Silver Fox, and TigerShark, as well as ground sensor systems such as the Remote Observation Post (ROP), Portable Cooled Infrared Kit (PCIRK), and P417. The objective of this procurement is to ensure engineering and technical support services are in place to support SSPO as they upgrade the capabilities of these multiple systems using emerging electronics, avionics, detection, and sensor technologies. Engineering and technical support services are also required to provide support for advanced ground control station (GCS) shelters efforts that support common communication platforms. This procurement is issued as a sole-source 8(a) procurement under FAR part 19.8 and Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 USC 637(a)(1)). This will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee effort. <br />

<DESC>Application for Brand Name Justification
 
1.   Requesting Agency:   Department of Veterans Affairs
 1335 East-West Highway
 Suite 1100
				 Silver Spring, MD  20910
 
      Contracting activity:		Center for Acquisition Innovation-Austin
1701 Directors Blvd., Suite 600
Austin, TX 78744
 
2. Nature and/or description of the action:  
 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Enterprise Development has a requirement for the purchase of six new Laurel Bridge DCF Local Server Licenses in support of VistA Imaging BHIE.

 3.   A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):  
 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Enterprise Development has a requirement for the purchase of six new licenses in support of VistA Imaging BHIE.  These new licenses are for the CVIX server nodes.  The estimated value of this purchase is $7,465.00   

4.   An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.    
 
 FAR Part 6.302-1   "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements"
  
5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.  
The purchase will be used for high availability deployments of mission critical CVIX Enterprise Gateways for sharing medical artifacts between VA and DoD. Software required by CVIX application:   DCF LOCAL SERVER LICENSE with 1 year maintenance.  Software and application are designed to work in unison and only the specified software can provide the functionality necessary to ensure appliances operate correctly and efficiently without substantial cost of reconfiguration.
6.   A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  
 
This requirement will be solicited on either NASA SEWP or in accordance with VA policy, allowing many resellers to compete for this requirement. 
 
7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  
 
The SEWP contracts are FAR Part 12 Commercial Contracts, and additional price analysis was done in accordance with the following: The price design for SEWP is a proposed discount off the offerer's commercial list price. Price analysis was conducted in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(1), to ensure that a "fair and reasonable" price is paid by the Government. 

Reasonableness of proposed prices was established in accordance with 15.403-1(c)(1)(i)(B) which provides that a price is based on adequate price competition if two or more responsible offerers, competing independently submit priced offers that satisfy the Government's expressed requirement and there is not any finding that the price of an otherwise successful offer is unreasonable. To verify price reasonableness, offerers were instructed to submit their published price catalog or published schedule of list prices in a form regularly maintained by the manufacturer or offerers, such as a catalog, price list, schedule, or other verifiable and established record. Additionally, each contractor proposed a discount off of product categories (such as input-output device) of IT equipment. 

These discounts remain for the life of the contract. Therefore, when new technology is added or list prices change due to market fluctuations, the SEWP price remains fair and reasonable. 

There are several other price reasonability checkpoints in SEWP: 
o	A SEWP Prime Contract Holder cannot offer prices higher on their SEWP contract than is offered on their GSA contract. This is exclusive of the surcharge. Since the SEWP fee is 0.5% compared to GSA's 0.75% fee, SEWP prices must be lower than GSA for that Contract Holder. 
o	When items are added or prices updated on a SEWP contract, prices are automatically compared to other SEWP contracts and must be within a reasonable price of all other contracts. Further comparisons with GSA, commercial and other contracts may be done to verify any questionable pricing. 
o	All SEWP Delivery Orders are subject to Fair Opportunity. This internal competition provides an incentive for Contract Holders to provide the best possible price in order to be selected for award.
 
8. A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  
 
 This item is widely available on SEWP and GSA schedule.  By searching on the part number in the established catalog or price lists available at the websites of http://www.sewp.nasa.gov and http://www.gsaadvantage.gov it can be shown that many vendors are able to compete for this requirement. 
 
9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: 
 
	N/A

10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.   
 
     N/A 
 
11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  
 
 As VA continues to modernize the server environment to run more efficiently and effectively, other software solutions may prove to be cost efficient in the long run.  However, this does not provide relief from the competition limitations.  It would at best, place VA into a subsequent brand name situation with, at best, a different software manufacturer.  This undesirable situation still would cost less than the cost of development, maintenance, upgrade, configuration, testing and modernization of internal software to maintain the server environment.
