<DESC>The Bureau of alcohol, Tobbacco and Firearms ATF intends to negotiate under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 a sole Sole service agreement with Air Control Techniques, services are as follows: Evaluation program of airborne emissions (in gaseous and solid forms) from a standard Hurd?s Burn Trailer while being used to destroy common small arms ammunition. The unit to be tested is the Hurd?s Burn Trailer as manufactured by Hurd?s Welding of Harrisburg, Oregon.  Testing will be to present a finished report to the Explosives Technology Branch of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF-ETB).  At the time of presentation of said report, ETB-ATF will then be free to distribute the result of said testing to other interested parties as well as state and local public safety agencies. The Hurd?s Burn Trailer, while being operated with small arms ammunition, pyrotechnics or Class 1.4 Consumer Fireworks, produces smoke and flames.  The flames and emissions are vented through a top stack, as well as occasional significant flashes of some significance from the side and bottom vents.  The burn vessel is mounted on a trailer platform, which has duel axles.  The two burner pipes in the burn vessel are fired from two, 40-pound Liquid Petroleum Gas cylinders mounted on the trailer unit.  The gas is ignited manually from a handheld propane torch and pressure is controlled by an on-board regulator at approximately 18 psi. The burn vessel is manually loaded through a hinged door on the rear end of the trailer.  While the vessel can be loaded with the entire contents of a five-gallon bucket filled with ammunition, better efficiency is experienced with three quarters or one half of a bucket per load.  Expended brass casings and copper bullet jackets are removed manually after the burn is completed, usually in 10 ? 15 minutes.  Burn time is based upon ambient air temperature, humidity, the type and caliber of ammunition, and remaining gas level in the tanks.  Lead, tin and other bullet metals are melted out and run out of a bottom vent into a collection bucket below the burn vessel.The test program is to accurately measure the particulate matter, toxic metals and oxides thereof, and nitrogen oxides emissions of the Hurd?s Burn Trailer during the destruction of small arms ammunition.  The ammunition will be limited to .50 caliber US and lesser calibers.  Ammunition for the testing will be supplied by the contracting agency (ATF-ETB).All testing will be performed in a manner which is in strict accordance with U.S. Environmental Projection Agency (EPA) reference methods for the determination of particulate matters, metals, and nitrogen oxides exiting the unit during and following the batch charge ignition.  The testing program will consist of three test runs using combined U.S. EPA Reference Methods 5 (Determination of Particulate Emissions) and Method 29 (Determination of Metals Emissions).  U.S. EPA Reference Method 7E (Measurement of Nitrogen Oxides Emissions) will also be conducted by the contractor. The contractor will, based on these tests, enumerate the following emissions data and exhaust stream characteristics and will provide these in report form to ATF, ETB:Mass emissions rate of total filterable particulate expressed in units of pounds per pound of charge.	Mass emission rates of arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, phosphorus, silver and zinc in units of pounds per pound of charge.	Nitrogen oxides emissions in units of pounds of NOx (NO2) per pound of charge.Gas flow rate in units of standard cubic feet per minute and actual cubic feet per minute.Gas stream temperature in units of degrees Fahrenheit measured at the vent stack and other locations of the contractor?s choosing.Gas stream moisture content in units of % volume measured at the vent stack and other locations of the contractor?s choosing.The total filterable particulate matter and toxic metals emissions data are required to effectively demonstrate and characterize the emissions rates to establish whether or not the unit will present an environmental hazard in locations where the unit may potentially be used.The toxic metals emissions data are required to determine if the personnel/agency operating the unit must file a report under the Continuous Release Rule (CRR) in accordance with Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), and Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPACRA). (The Continuous Release Rule (CRR) provides a reduced reporting option for facilities that release hazardous substances in a manner that is continuous, and stable in quantity and rate, and is not otherwise covered by a federally enforceable permit.)The nitrogen oxides data are also required for CRR purposes.TECHNICAL APPROACH:A test protocol will be prepared by the contractor, which will conform to U.S. EPA requirements and will be prepared and submitted to ATF-ETB.  This protocol will include specific information concerning the test location, U.S. EPA Reference test methods, quality assurance procedures, test schedule, operating data documentation, test personnel, and test program health and safety procedures.Contractor will use the well-accepted quasi0-stack technique for capturing emissions from the vent stack of the burn vessel.  The quasi-stack method as applied will involve as loose-fitting temporary hood around the ignition chamber and the use of an adequately size temporary duct and fan system for gas movement to and past the emission testing location.  The vent system will collect the entire vessel emissions as well as allow for intermittent increases in pressure due to the ammunition ignition and propellant burning.  The quasi-stack ducting will deliver the gasses and emissions to a safe and suitable test location at least 30 feet distant from the burn trailer unit. The temporary ductwork supplied by the contractor will be made of non-metal materials to prevent biasing the test results to a higher-than-true metal emission level. The duct work as supplied must be able to survive without destruction, material degradation or off-gassing in an environment around the burn vessel which is subjected flame from Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) burners within the burn vessel, and subsequent flashes and flames from the ignition of by products of small arms ammunition subjected to said flames.  The required fan system shall be suitable for the application and shall be supplied by the contractor.Gas samples will be withdrawn from the temporary duct system using a combined EPA Method 5/Method 29 sampling train.  This sampling train shall consist of a glass nozzle, a heated glass probe with an S-type pitot tube attached, a filter, six chilled impingers, and a metering console.  The sampling train shall undergo pretest and posttest leak tests.  The filter temperature will be maintained at 248oF ? 25oF, and the impinger exit temperature will be maintained below 68oF. The train shall be operated at isokinetic conditions and otherwise comply with the requirements of EPA Method 5. In accordance with U.S. EPA Method 29 requirements, each of the three test runs will be two hours in duration and will sample a minimum of 60 dry standard cubic feet.  ATF-ETB personnel will assure that between four and eight separate charges of the burn vessel, each lasting approximately 15 to 30 minutes, will be performed to assure the time and volume required for necessary sample volumes.
At the conclusion of each Method 5/Method 29 test run, the sampling train shall be moved to a clean-up area provided by the contractor.  The samples shall be recovered using procedures that satisfy Method 5/Methos 29, and applicable EOPA sample recovery quality assurance guidelines.  Suitable time for sample recovery will be factored in by ATF-ETB.ATF-ETB personnel will plan on and provide for a sampling train preparation period of approximately one-hour for each Method 5/Method 29 testing run, as well as two hours for sampling, and two hours for sample recovery.  Recharging with live small arms ammunition and the subsequent recovery of expended materials will be performed as rapidly and safely as possible by EPA-ETB personnel, in concert with 
the testing efforts of the contractor.  At no time will safety be compromised in favor of expedience. In order to allow for materials handling of small arms ammunition, and the volume of expended materials produced, a schedule of no more than three days of testing may be allowed.For particulate analysis, the contractor shall use an acetone rinse, which will then be analyzed gravimetrically according to U.S. EPA Method 5.  For all metals, except mercury, the acetone rinse, the filter, the absorbing reagents and the rinses shall be analyzed by inductively coupled argon plasma spectroscopy (ICAP) or atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) in accordance with Method 29.  Cold vapor atomic absorption (CVAA) will be used to analyze the recovered samples for mercury.The following metals will be analyzed and reported by the contractor: 

Arsenic(As)Beryllium (Be)
Cadmium (Cd
Chromium (Cr)
Copper (Cu)
Lead (Pb)
Mercury (Hg)
Nickel (Ni)
Phosphorus (P)
Silver (Ag)
Zinc (Zn)
 

The nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations will be measured using U.S. EPA Reference Method 7E (Continuous Measurement of Nitrogen Oxides).  The contractor will use a California Analytical chemiluminescent NOx analyzer that is capable of separately measuring NO and NO2. The contractor will obtain weights of the small arms ammunition loads prior to each burn, and subsequent to the burn the spent materials recovered will be weighed by the contractor and documented. TEST REPORTS:The contractor will provide to ATF-ETB within 60 calendar days of completion of all on-site testing, all reports, collected data, a summary of the tests and results therefore, as well as a summary of all quality assurance procedures used.  The scope of the quality assurance aspect will include, but not necessarily be limited to:Sample nozzle mensions
Meter box audit data Isokinetic sampling rates Thermocouple calibration data Sampling train leak check results Pitot leak check results Sample train operating temperatures Sample Train operating pressures Reagent blank analyses Method 1 data sheet

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The South American Institute for Medical Research (SAIMR), Ministry of Health, a contract to conduct population based active surveillance for cryptococcosis in Gauteng province, South Africa.  These services will include, but is not limited to the following (1) collect isolates, complete cryptococcal surveillance initiative case report, and maintain database; (2) deliver isolates collected to CDC Laboratory; (3) submit database and cryptococcosis trend reports on a quarterly basis.  The South American Institute for Medical Research (NHL, National Health Laboratory System) is the only known institution in Gauteng province (Johannesburg) that can provide the necessary infrastructure to perform this project.  This project requires that cryptococcal isolates be collected on a regular basis from all laboratories in the province.  All public health laboratories in the province operate under the auspices of the National Health Laboratory (NHL), so the participation of the NHL is critical to ensuring that isolates from the public hospitals can be collected.  The NHL Central Laboratory, which is the reference laboratory for the province, possesses the staff and expertise so that isolates can be collected and maintained appropriately.  Furthermore, the project also requires that demographic and clinical information be collected from medical records of patients with cryptococcosis.  SAIMR faculty participate in teaching and providing clinical service in many hospitals in Gauteng province and have collaborated with many investigators in these hospitals on other projects, which will ensure a more complete date collection for surveillance purposes. The period of performance is twenty-four months.  It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded around August 31, 2002 with performance to begin September 1, 2002.  The scheduled solicitation issue date is approximately June 12, 2002.  The solicitation will also be posted at this website (http://www.eps.gov/) on or around June 12, 2002.  Any amendments issued to this solicitation will also be available at the same website.  Hardcopies of the solicitation and any amendments issued will not be mailed to the offerors.

<SUBJECT>A--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - Electronic Support for the Objective Force (ESOF) Science and Technology Objective (STO)
<SOLNBR>DAAB0702RL734
<RESPDATE>092602
<ARCHDATE>11252002
<CONTACT>Angela Smeaton, 732-427-7220
<DESC>NA Description:   This is a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis. Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is gathering information regarding the technology potential for future Army unattended ground SIGINT and UAV ELINT sensor systems.  I2W D is initiating a new Science and Technology Objective (STO) program in FY03.  It is called Electronic Support for the Objective Force (ESOF).  The ESOF STO will have a duration of four (4) years and will be focused on maturing remote sensor technology, si gnal processing techniques, and data fusion techniques for transition to Prophet Blocks IV and V and Future Combat Systems (FCS).  (Note: The data fusion techniques of interest are those that fuse data at or near the sensor and reduce the amount of informa tion transmitted through the communications link.)  Products from the ESOF STO will be tested and evaluated in the Night Vision Networked Sensors for the Objective Force (NSOF) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  The information requested below will be used by I2WD in planning and developing a technical architecture and requirements, and in assessing the technology readiness for the potential development of a future system by a Materiel Developer and industry.  Background: The goal of the next generation of the US Army's ground and aerial Radio Frequency (RF) reconnaissance and surveillance systems is to extend the reach and accuracy of existing stand-off sensors with unattended remote ground sensors (UGS) SIGINT  and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ELINT  sensors.  There are multiple government-funded programs in place today that address parts of this requirement.  The ESOF STO mission is to integrate technology from existing 6.1/6.2/6.3 programs and mature technica l areas required for successful transition to Prophet and FCS programs in the FY05-06 timeframe.  Successful transition is defined as UGS SIGINT and UAV ELINT sensor systems at Technology Readiness Level 6.  TRL 6 is defined as sensor systems, signal proce ssing algorithms, and data fusion algorithms that have been successfully field tested in a realistic environment on functional prototype hardware.  TRL 6 products of the ESOF STO should demonstrate sufficient risk reduction for transition to 6.4-funded pro ductization efforts conducted by PM Prophet, PM RUS, and PM FCS. I2WD seeks responses about the following major Components: 1. Unattended ground sensors that cover 30MHz-18GHz, BW 10-60 MHz 2. Unmanned aerial vehicle sensors that cover 500MHz - 18GHz, BW 80-500 MHz  3. Receiver capabilities such as sensitivity, dynamic range, etc.  4.  Emitter identification and geo-location signal processing techniques compatible with Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) requirements of remote UGS or UAV based sensors   5. Data fusion techniques applicable at or near the sensor(s) to reduce t he amount of information transmitted through the communications link, and 6. Remote sensor control and coordination techniques to maximize the effectiveness of the deployed systems (i.e.: methods of cueing and controlling remote sensors to maximize probabi lity of detecting non-cooperative RF emitters.  The control and coordination approach should consider coordinated collection by ground and air sensors to achieve precision geo-location.) Technical subjects: 1. Frequency range coverage, 2. Co-channel and/or multipath processing for intercept and location, 3. Complex modulations, i.e. digital, spread spectrum, LPI, 4. Complex RADAR, i.e. sophisticated waveforms, impulse, and wide-band LPI, 5 . Geo-location precision, 6. Connectivity with evolving communications networks, 7. Data filtering to reduce load on the communications link from the sensor to upper echelon warfighters, 8. Sensor correlation and cross-cue, 9. Moving emitter tracking, 10. Use of terrain and sensor geometry data, 11. Very remote operator control, 12. Size, mobility, sustainability, self-deployability, 13. Size, weight, and power compatibility with FCS mini UAV concepts.  Please address the above with respect to UGS SIGINT and UAV ELINT based sensor systems separately. Tables I and II may be used as a guide in addressing these technical requirements.  Responses can be of any format. Supplemental materials, such as brochure s, briefings, spec sheets, etc., are welcome, as long as they accompany a response. When preparing your responses, be specific, and make sure you answer the following questions. What technology, by name, fits this background, falls under what component(s) and area(s), and what technical subject(s) does it address? How? Describe the technology in detail. What is the status of the technology? Is it available now? If not, when will it be available? How extensively has it been tested? Does your organization wis h to point out any special considerations that I2WD should know about developing the system described that is not included in the components, areas, or technical subjects listed above? All sources involved with any subjects discussed above are invited to r espond. This RFI does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to purchase systems or services. The Government will not award a contract based on this RFI. The Government will not pay for the information received in response to this RFI. A cknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's evaluation of the information received. All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your organization, i.e. Large Business, Small B usiness, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), other educational institution, non-profit organization, or Government lab, in their responses. No faxes will be accepted.  If you choose t o submit proprietary information, mark it accordingly.

<DESC>NA The Defense Contracting Command - Washington, on behalf of the Joint Staff, J-8, Simulation and Analysis Management Division (SAMD), plans to pursue a sole source contract with the BIO Group, Inc of the United States, Cambridge, MA to further develop the a gent-based Counter Drug simulation tool and extend the methodology into a more general and robust application for examining future military operational concepts and architectures. The services required to meet the Joint Staff, J-8 needs, as a result of pre vious concept design work (Phase 1) initial agent-based model development (Phase 2), and further expansion of the model (Phase 3 and 3a).  The contractor will further enhance the Counter Drug (CD) Simulation as a use case for incorporating co-evolving proc esses and instantiating a methodology that evolves key elements of force structure (Concept of Operations, Force Elements, and Command & Control) by using an agent-based model in support of the Joint Staff.  The contractor will make maximum use of methodol ogies and algorithms already developed (both conventional operations research techniques and those using complex adaptive systems).  For scoping purposes, development will be limited to the Counter Drug related activities.  This should provide the user wit h a better capability to interpret the results (e.g., why the threat changes mode of operation/strategy; how Blue can better manage Red to his advantage based on data signatures for impending change), and (2) Developing and incorporating a genetic algorith um-based strategy evolver that could be used to grow new strategies and evaluate future force designs and concepts of operations.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to DAKO Corporation, 6392 Via Real, Carpinteria, CA 93013, for one DAKO Autostainer Universal Staining System. The DAKO system is the only product available which meets all of the Government's requirements which includes the following: 1) Must allow the use of reagents from a wide variety of suppliers in order for the lab to use a wide variety of antibodies and reagents necessary to detect key markers in a number of domestic animal species. 2) Must have the ability to turn off any heating unit incorporated into the system. 3) Must use standard microscopic glass slides. 4) Must have an auditory alarm system. The system must alert the technical staff that a process failure has occurred and shall let them know where in the process failure occurred. 5) The system must be PC based. The system shall use software that is Windows compatible. Programming software shall allow each slide to be programmed with a separate protocol, allowing greater flexibility and economy when running multiple types of analyses. 6) The system shall allow the separation of hazardous from non-hazardous waste in order to reduce the amount and disposal cost of the hazardous waste produced. 7) The system shall be able to reliably perform unmonitored nighttime runs, and use a reagent probe, not a pipette requiring disposable pipette tips. (Systems using pipette tips tend to drop tips during a run. This causes the entire group of slides to be re-run) A system that uses a reagent probe eliminates the problem of rerunning a test, allows the tests to be run unmonitored (overnight) as well as eliminating the cost of disposable pipettes. 8) System shall have a minimum slide capacity of 48 slides.

This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The Government believes only one responsible source can provide the product that will satisfy the agency requirements. This notice of intent is not a Request For Proposal (RFP). See Numbered Note 22. Responses are due by 3:00 p.m. on September 9, 2002. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses must be submitted to Debra C. Kaelberer, Contracting Officer, at USDA, FSIS, ASD, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Maildrop 5230, Beltsville, MD 20705-5230. Responses will also be accepted by fax at 301-504-4276 or by e-mail at debra.kaelberer@fsis.usda.gov.

The Marine Corps Northeast Regional Contract Office currently has a requirement for the following Statement of Work, as follows: STATEMENT OF WORK  FOR RESTORATION OF SOVIET 122MM D-74 FIELDGUN S/N 38675 1.  OBJECTIVE:  This  Statement of Work (SOW) is for the pick-up, disassembly, restoration, reassembly, and return of the Soviet 122mm gun [circa 19??].  The end result of this restoration project shall be to have a completely restored artifact to its original status with all appropriate markings, paint schemes, and equipment where applicable.  The Soviet 122mm gun shall  not be restored in such a way that it will depreciate its value or originality. 2.  PICK UP AND DELIVERY:  The gun shall be picked up at the Museums Branch Restoration Section,  Building 2112, Marine Corps Base, Quantico, Virginia.  Upon completion of the restoration the gun shall be returned to the Museums Branch Restoration Section for final inspection and acceptance.  The Contractor shall provide a plan of action and milestones on how they anticipate completing the project. 3.  DOCUMENTATION:  Written and digital photographic documentation shall be maintained through the entire restoration process.   Each step of the restoration shall be documented and a copy shall be supplied to the Museums Branch for future reference.  A list of materials used and any information such as type of paint, method of application, source of supply, or any unusual steps required to be taken  during the restoration process shall be submitted to the Contracting Officers Representative (COR). 4.  PROCEDURES:  All submittals of materials and methods shall be reviewed by the COR and the Museums Branch Head of Restoration and written approval, or disapproval, shall be given prior to the commencement of any work. All questions that arise during the restoration process that are not covered in this SOW or other documents attached to this contract, shall be directed to the COR in writing for review.  The Contractor is reminded that only the Contracting Officer has the authority to bind the Government to any changes which will increase the cost or period of performance for this contract. All Hazardous Materials shall be removed and disposed of in accordance with all federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations.  This shall include but is not limited to oils,  fuels, antifreeze, radioactive material (as directed), and greases. All disassembly of the 122mm gun shall be done at manufacture points that have been bolted, pinned or pressed together only.  No alterations of the artifact for disassembly shall be allowed other than those that have been specified in this contract or prior written approval from the COR  If new or manufactured items are utilized, it shall be noted in the records and the new part shall be marked as NOS (Not Original Stock) and dated indicating its date of manufacture.  (Great care shall be used in the disassembly of this weapon to ensure personnel safety as this is a foreign weapon and the recoil, traversing and elevation mechanisms may still be under pressure.)  The plaque welded to the side of the gun trail shall not be removed or altered.  No battle-damaged areas shall be repaired.  If an area has excessi ve surface corrosion but is still intact, it shall be preserved as is. The tires will be replaced as directed. The breech and breechblock have been altered by a means similar to those used to demilitarize weapons of this style and shall be repaired.   All portions of these items that have been altered by cutting or welding shall be returned to their original appearance.  All handles or latches that have been welded shut shall be carefully cut free and the welds ground down smooth to match existing surrounding surfaces.  Any blockage that may be welded inside of the barrel shall remain if it is not causing complications to the rest of the restoration process.    All original components of the artifact shall be maintained and used again to the fullest extent possible.  When making repairs to components that have been excessively damaged or are severely corroded the contract or shall reuse as much of the original material as possible during the repair process.  An example would be the sight box located on the shield of the gun, which has a corroded lid, but the rest of the box is intact, only the lid shall be replaced.  Components, parts, wires etc. shall not be replaced unless deteriorated beyond practical usability and serviceability.  Original components that are repaired shall be fully documented and approved in writing by the COR before the repair has been completed.  All original components removed and not reused shall be retained and returned to the Museums Branch for accountability. All hydraulic and pneumatic type system components shall be purged, treated for corrosion and preserved.  Corrosion treatment and preservation methods of these components shall be the same as that use on the drive train.   The axles assembly shall be disas sembled and treated for corrosion.  Unless an internal component has excessive corrosion it shall only be cleaned with solvent.  If corrosion does have to be removed the mildest method shall be used so as to not alter the surface, or serviceability, of the component.  No Greases, oils, or lubricant of any kind shall be applied to these components.  These components shall be coated with a preservative coating.  The methods and materials used shall be in coordination with the Restorations Chief, Marine Corps Museums Branch. All paint and corrosion shall be removed where feasible.  Only methods approved in writing by the COR shall be utilized for the removal of paint and corrosion.  There are several types of blast media and chemical strippers currently being used for the removal of paint and corrosion.  These various materials range from sand, glass, and plastic beads to walnu t shells.  The correct selection of material and usage shall depend upon the base material of the component to be stripped or cleaned.  When selecting the most appropriate material, and application, for the removal of paint and corrosion the mildest means possible shall be the rule.  If chemical stripping is to be used, extreme caution shall be used in order to prevent damage to the artifact. If the corrosion cannot be removed, it shall be treated with a corrosion conversion/neutralizing agent as directed by the Restorations Chief.   The paint and coatings utilized shall be a urethane coating with appropriate primer and shall be applied by the contractor in a manner, which will give the same effect intended as the original paint. Paint methods and paint schemes shall be in accordance with specific written instructions provided by the Museums Branch.  The point of contact for  paint guidelines is the Ordnance Specialist, Museums Branch, Quantico, VA (703) 784-2607 stengerd@nt.quantico.usmc.mil.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), plans to procure services for the U.S. Radiologic Technologists Health Study from the University of Minnesota, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, DelCode 8807 Mayo, 420 Delaware Street S E, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.  This acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The mission of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics includes the planning and conduct of research using epidemiologic and biostatistical approaches to investigate the distribution and determinants of cancer in human populations.  The Radiation Epidemiology Branch is specifically charged with identifying and quantifying the risk of cancer in populations exposed to ionizing radiation.  In 1982, the Radiation Epidemiology Branch contracted with the University of Minnesota (N01-CP-21015) to conduct an epidemiologic study of 145,000 medical x-ray technologists certified by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) between 1926 and 1982.  The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term health effects of chronic occupational exposure to moderate- to low-level radiation.  A baseline survey was conducted during 1984-87.  Detailed data on work history, cancer prevalence, and cancer risk factors were provided by more than 90,000 (68%) technologists.   Sole-source add-on contracts were awarded to the University of Minnesota in 1991 (NO1-CP-15673) and 1995 (N01-CP-51016) to establish a repository of biologic samples for genetic studies and to conduct a second survey for incident cancers.  Approximately 91,000 technologists completed the second survey during 1995-98 (72% overall; 84% of first survey responders), providing updated and more detailed information on employment histories, medical exposures, gynecologic and reproductive histories, and many other cancer risk factors.  More than 7,000 additional cancers were reported.  Ongoing efforts in cancer validation, quality control review of a combined cancer confirmation file, and blood collection was completed in 2000.  The potential for this cohort to contribute needed information to our limited understanding of protracted low dose radiation is extensive.  Generally healthy people of all ages, races, and both genders, whose radiation doses can be well characterized, are available for study.  These x-ray technologists have received a wide range of doses and many have performed jobs which resulted in considerable cumulative radiation doses.  We recently completed a dose assessment (Version 1), reconstructing annual doses for the 90,000 technologists who completed the baseline survey.  With the availability of genetic information, it will now be possible to conduct analyses of gene-radiation interactions.  Minimum Requirements:  The requirements to be accomplished by the contractor for this procurement are to: (a) coordinate collection of blood samples and updated risk factor information from subgroups of the radiologic technologists; (b) medically validate cancers; (c) perform expert nosology coding of all outcomes; (d) data coding, keying, and quality control review; and (f) maintain a receipt control system to monitor all activities.   The University of Minnesota is the only source known to the NCI that has direct involvement in collecting the data through two large questionnaire surveys, conducting medical validation, and obtaining biospecimens and risk factor information from study subjects, staff from the University of Minnesota have intimate knowledge of the information contained within this comprehensive database and are uniquely qualified to interpret these data. This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on September 3, 2002.   If you have and questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Request for Information/Information Exchange

Background:  As a result of a Type II Business Case Analysis (BCA) conducted by the Army Audit Agency, the Soldier Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM) was tasked to lead Army's reengineering effort for OCIE and Central Issue Facility (CIF) operations. They coordinated with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP)/Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), which led to a greater DLA role in continuous process improvement.  DLA supports approximately 54 Army Central Issue Facilities (CIFs) worldwide, including 25 CONUS CIFs, with over 100 different items covering 1,000 National Stock Numbers (NSN). Sales to the CIF community totaled $59 million in FY97, $70 million in FY98, and $78 million in FY99. DLA has taken initiatives to improve support for Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment (OCIE) for its' customers.  Army and DSCP have formed an Integrated Process Team (IPT) to further explore the recommendations of the BCA as it indicated substantial savings were possible through DLA taking over inventory and the operations of Army Central Issue Facilities (CIF) and Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment (OCIE).  Subsequently, the initiative gained further visibility in Europe, the Pacific, and in CONUS.  USAREUR DCSLOG asked DLA to investigate ownership of used OCIE as well as the possible assumption of day-to-day operations at Army CIFs and to conduct a similar study for support in the Pacific.
  
Three scenarios were offered, all economically viable:  

1)	DLA takes ownership of OCIE stocks and assumes management of CIFs through 3PLs, keeping existing Status Quo business rules.
2)	DLA owns CIFs and inventory, but streamlines CIF 3PL contracting processes to central DLA resources.  
3)	DLA owns CIFs, and develops strategic reengineered wholesale-retail supply chains, as already begun in Europe and Korea, and as is commonly found among best commercial practices of successful companies.  DLA can potentially benefit from this last scenario by optimizing requirements, acquisition and supply operations.  Support requirements are consolidated directly from retail customers, direct customer billing can reduce duplicative billing/inventory reconciliation requirements and customer ordering and return policy costs.  Further, more accurate inventory stock level determination is possible due to aggregation of demands and efficient group buys.

The conclusion of the BCA is Scenario 3, transfer of the OCIE inventory and management responsibilities of CIF operations through 3rd party logistic providers to DLA, is the best Alternative, and will potentially improve economies and business operations for both the Army and DLA.  Key improvements include:
?	Streamlining to 'one supplier, one customer.'
?	Elimination of redundant supply management operations and inventories.
?	Better asset visibility and control.
?	Better Demand Forecasting for vendor-wholesale-retail requirements.
?	Improved supply effectiveness for both inventory and financial planning.

Important management considerations such as the need to develop reasonable time frames for developing needed item management information systems, item physical transfers to single points of issue, and accounting adjustments for stock ownership need to be addressed.  Also, detailed coordination between the Army and DLA is required to ensure Army forward stock locations adequately meet operational requirements, possibly in excess of standardized economic order quantity calculations.  		

There are many obvious benefits to such a system.  DSCP would gain the tools it needs to implement a just-in-time inventory system through more accurate forecasting.  For the first time ever, true total asset visibility could be achieved in the OCIE arena.  In addition, excess inventory could be reduced or eliminated throughout the pipeline.  This system would also support a deployment scenario much more efficiently than today's local property book CIF environment.  A soldier could deploy without advance notice and not have to deal with the burden of completely clearing their equipment at his or her home duty station.

Next Steps:  DLA and the Army are conducting an in-depth Type I BCA. This is being conducted to validate the findings of the Type II BCA.  It will do so by substantiating the proposed cost savings obtained by re-engineering the CIF supply chain processes and by the assumption of OCIE asset ownership by DLA at the CIF level. In substantiating the cost savings, it is required to develop an optimized regional distribution network with a quantitative analysis of the transportation channels identified to support that network.   A clear definition of the 'to-be' model will be defined.  A data call to all CIFs will be conducted to identify actual costs.  Should the findings of this analysis show such a program to be viable, DSCP will initiate a pilot program at a site mutually selected by DLA and the Army.

The Government is also engaging potential solution providers to obtain feedback.  We are interested in sharing our project concept, obtaining industry interest, exchanging ideas about possible solutions and promoting industry consideration as a third party logistics provider.

Information Exchange with Industry:  DSCP is scheduling an Information Exchange with interested parties in an attempt to identify and exchange critical elements in the development of this project should the findings of the Type I Analysis so indicate.  This exchange will take place at Defense Supply Center Philadelphia on September 12, 2002.  For additional information regarding participation in this exchange, contact Rose Crognale at 215-737-3073 or rcrognale@dscp.dla.mil.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to acquire using Simplified Acquisition Procedures on a sole source basis twelve solid state body-worn recorders (model: Geonautics TAG A1 Whisper from Geonautics International, Inc). The Geonautics A1 Whisper has the following salient characteristics. The Geonautics A1 Whisper is a solid state recorder of very small size, with a recording time of over seven hours, which automatically makes new files - for multiple evidentiary recordings - without having to download previously recorded audio. It has the capability of using RS232 or USB computer interfaces, and will work with either Windows NT or Windows 2000.  It also allows the use of the industry-standard WAV file for downloads/playback and it provides an audit trail of identifiers. SSA intends to order the Whisper A1 on a sole source basis from Geonautics because it is the smallest solid state audio recording device currently available, with the highest quality audio and the greatest length of recording time available.  It is the only known solid state recording unit that works with the SSA?s Windows NT operating system and will also work with Windows 2000,  when SSA upgrades to that operating system. It does not require a special computer board or computer for playback.  SSA will not respond to requests for solicitation copies and will not pay for information received in response to this announcement. If necessary, SSA will issue a Request For Quotation (RFQ) for this requirement to interested parties.   Responses to this announcement must provide sufficient information for SSA to determine that an organization other than the Geonautics can provide a solid state device of equal or better capabilities as outlined above. If SSA does not receive an acceptable response to this announcement within 7 days of its publication, it will issue an order to Geonautics for the Whisper A1 devices.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is gathering information regarding the technology potential for future Army unattended ground SIGINT and UAV ELINT sensor systems.  I2W D is initiating a new Science and Technology Objective (STO) program in FY03.  It is called Electronic Support for the Objective Force (ESOF).  The ESOF STO will have a duration of four (4) years and will be focused on maturing remote sensor technology, si gnal processing techniques, and data fusion techniques for transition to Prophet Blocks IV and V and Future Combat Systems (FCS).  (Note: The data fusion techniques of interest are those that fuse data at or near the sensor and reduce the amount of informa tion transmitted through the communications link.)  Products from the ESOF STO will be tested and evaluated in the Night Vision Networked Sensors for the Objective Force (NSOF) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  The information requested below will be used by I2WD in planning and developing a technical architecture and requirements, and in assessing the technology readiness for the potential development of a future system by a Materiel Developer and industry.  Background: The goal of the next generation of the US Army's ground and aerial Radio Frequency (RF) reconnaissance and surveillance systems is to extend the reach and accuracy of existing stand-off sensors with unattended remote ground sensors (UGS) SIGINT  and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ELINT  sensors.  There are multiple government-funded programs in place today that address parts of this requirement.  The ESOF STO mission is to integrate technology from existing 6.1/6.2/6.3 programs and mature technica l areas required for successful transition to Prophet and FCS programs in the FY05-06 timeframe.  Successful transition is defined as UGS SIGINT and UAV ELINT sensor systems at Technology Readiness Level 6.  TRL 6 is defined as sensor systems, signal proce ssing algorithms, and data fusion algorithms that have been successfully field tested in a realistic environment on functional prototype hardware.  TRL 6 products of the ESOF STO should demonstrate sufficient risk reduction for transition to 6.4-funded pro ductization efforts conducted by PM Prophet, PM RUS, and PM FCS. I2WD seeks responses about the following major Components: 1. Unattended ground sensors that cover 30MHz-18GHz, BW 10-60 MHz 2. Unmanned aerial vehicle sensors that cover 500MHz - 18GHz, BW 80-500 MHz  3. Receiver capabilities such as sensitivity, dynamic range, etc.  4.  Emitter identification and geo-location signal processing techniques compatible with Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) requirements of remote UGS or UAV based sensors   5. Data fusion techniques applicable at or near the sensor(s) to reduce t he amount of information transmitted through the communications link, and 6. Remote sensor control and coordination techniques to maximize the effectiveness of the deployed systems (i.e.: methods of cueing and controlling remote sensors to maximize probabi lity of detecting non-cooperative RF emitters.  The control and coordination approach should consider coordinated collection by ground and air sensors to achieve precision geo-location.) Technical subjects: 1. Frequency range coverage, 2. Co-channel and/or multipath processing for intercept and location, 3. Complex modulations, i.e. digital, spread spectrum, LPI, 4. Complex RADAR, i.e. sophisticated waveforms, impulse, and wide-band LPI, 5 . Geo-location precision, 6. Connectivity with evolving communications networks, 7. Data filtering to reduce load on the communications link from the sensor to upper echelon war fighters, 8. Sensor correlation and cross-cue, 9. Moving emitter tracking, 10. Use of terrain and sensor geometry data, 11. Very remote operator control, 12. Size, mobility, sustainability, self-deployability, 13. Size, weight, and power compatibility with  FCS mini UAV concepts.  Please address the above with respect to UGS SIGINT and UAV ELINT based sensor systems separately. Tables I and II may be used as a guide in addressing these technical requirements.  Responses can be of any format. Supplemental mat erials, such as brochures, briefings, spec sheets, etc., are welcome, as long as they accompany a response. When preparing your responses, be specific, and make sure you answer the following questions. What technology, by name, fits this background, falls under what component(s) and area(s), and what technical subject(s) does it address? How? Describe the technology in detail. What is the status of the technology? Is it available now? If not, when will it be available? How extensively has it been tested? Do es your organization wish to point out any special considerations that I2WD should know about developing the system described that is not included in the components, areas, or technical subjects listed above? All sources involved with any subjects discusse d above are invited to respond. This RFI does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to purchase systems or services. The Government will not award a contract based on this RFI. The Government will not pay for the information received in  response to this RFI. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's evaluation of the information received. All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your organization, i.e.  Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), other educational institution, non-profit organization, or Government lab, in their responses.

For the modem modulator, all Offerors shall provide the Radyne Comstream DMD15 Universal IBS/IDR Satellite Modem or equivalent.   Any proposed equivalent modem shall be demonstrated with data to verify equivalent performance.  Failure to provide such data will render the proposal technically unacceptable. 

NOAA will provide as GFE 1.2 Mbps of transponder bandwidth on DOMSAT for the continuous HRIT data rebroadcast.  The excess bandwidth is available for any error correction coding that may be required to close the link at the SHRS with a bit error rate (BER) of at least 10-8.  All Offerors shall provide analyses to demonstrate how this BER is achieved.

The HBS shall also continuously rebroadcast on the same GFE 1.2 Mbps DOMSAT link the MSG decryption keys received from the PHRS for local use by the SHRS.

The SHRS shall accept decryption keys relayed from MSG by the PHRS and HBS in CLINs 0001 and 0002 via the GFE 1.2 Mbps DOMSAT.  The SHRS shall decrypt the MSG HRIT data files for processing, storage and display.  For the modem demodulator, all Offerors shall provide the Radyne Comstream DMD15 Universal IBS/IDR Satellite Modem or equivalent.  Any proposed equivalent modem shall be demonstrated with data to verify equivalent performance.  Failure to provide such data will render the proposal technically unacceptable.  The Offeror shall install and commission the SHRS at each location.

CLIN 0003B:  The optional Secondary HRIT Receive Station (SHRS) shall be identical to the SHRS in CLIN 0003A.  For those optional SHRS installation locations that are already equipped for reception of Meteosat data broadcast via DOMSAT, the SHRS shall be capable of reusing, in a shared configuration, the existing DOMSAT antennas.  The Offeror shall install and commission the SHRS at each optional location.

CLIN 0004:  As an option, the Offeror shall propose pricing for System Maintenance, on annually renewable, on-call basis onsite and via telephone for three additional years after expiration of the warranties for the PHRS, HBS, and each SHRS.

Factory and On-Site Acceptance Testing.  The functionality of the system shall be demonstrated by a Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) at the Offeror's facility prior to shipment.  At a minimum, the Offeror shall demonstrate during the FAT that the PHRS in CLIN 0001 has the capability of receiving data continuously and directly from an MSG satellite and can provide data in a valid format through DOMSAT to Secondary HRIT Receive Stations.  The vendor shall demonstrate, during factory and on-site acceptance testing, that the delivered system has the performance capability to continually ingest, display, store, and rebroadcast HRIT data over DOMSAT to multiple SHRS systems.  A test plan shall be provided at least 30 days prior to testing and canned test data files shall be provided with the PHRS in CLIN 0001. 

Delivery and Installation.  The Offeror shall deliver and install all the system components and provide all interconnecting cabling to make the systems ordered for CLINs 0001-0003B fully functional.

<DESC>NASA plans to renew its agreement with IMAX Space, Ltd. ("IMAX"), to enable collaborative production of an additional large format 3D film on the International Space Station (ISS). This collaboration builds upon the recent release of the IMAX 3D film SPACE STATION, produced in cooperation with NASA, which is now one of the top-20 grossing films in the United States. The new film will document completion of Station assembly as the Japanese and European laboratories are attached and the tempo of activities on ISS accelerates.  In the new film collaboration, NASA and IMAX seek to create a sequel of similar technical quality, educational content, and popular appeal. NASA has selected IMAX for this additional ISS film opportunity because IMAX has developed the only space-certified large format 3D camera system available to ensure seamless documentation of the completion of ISS assembly.   In initiating this collaboration, NASA does not seek to preclude, and indeed welcomes, proposals for additional large format film collaborations involving other NASA activities. Moreover, at an appropriate time, NASA intends to announce future opportunities for large format film collaborations on the fully assembled ISS.=09=20=20

<DESC>Questions concerning RFQ 075050
Internet Information Security Subscription Services


NOTE:  The President of the United States has proposed a major reorganization of the Executive Branch of the Federal government, calling for the creation of a new Department of Homeland Security.  The U.S. Congress is considering this proposed reorganization and may produce legislation on it.  While it is premature to predict exactly what such legislation may call for, such a reorganization, if approved by Congress and signed by the President, may well affect the name, location and organization of the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC).  For purposes of this RFQ, the term "NIPC" shall mean the National Infrastructure Protection Center (as currently organized), or its successor organization.

A - Answer				R - Response

Item #1

"We typically price on the number of IP addresses to perform our vulnerability analysis.

1.  "Do you have the number of IP addresses to be monitored?  If not could you give me the person responsible for answering this question?"

A:  The NIPC expects the vendor to provide unclassified analyzed intelligence on newly discovered cyber threats to and vulnerabilities of hardware and software in common usage by critical elements of information and telecommunications infrastructures in the United States.  The purpose of such intelligence is to warn owners and operators of those infrastructures what cyber threats and vulnerabilities they should be most concerned with (i.e., what cyber threats and vulnerabilities would pose the most significant risks) and what measures, if taken, would reduce or eliminate the risks associated with those threats and vulnerabilities.  The NIPC does not stipulate or require that a particular methodology be used to arrive at such intelligence, so long as the results prove accurate and credible for cyber warning purposes.  Also, the NIPC expects the vendor to be able to provide its own sources for lawfully gathering intrusion detection and related information, independent of the NIPC.  If the vendor's information sources should reveal an obvious and recent network attack (e.g., Denial of Service), then the NIPC would like to know the parameters associated with the attack, such as: apparent source country, IP address of apparent source, Internet service provider, time date, methodology.

Item #2

1.  Looking at the CLINs - it appears that your costing model is based on some s/w package.  Is this correct, and Do you have a preferred supplier for this project - or is there an incumbent for similar work? 

R:  The costing model is based on the way we are currently paying for the services.  We do not have a preferred supplier for this project, but there is an incumbent and they will be given an opportunity to submit a proposal.

2.  "Reading the Task & Deliverables - it can be interpreted as having our personnel work with the FBI to predict threat trends, to perform analysis, get access to cyber incident 	databases, and finally to produce an InfraGard [product].  The pricing model really suits the last  task - redistribution.  For the first three tasks - do you want a different costing proposal -- i.e., one that is better suited for work that will be frequently re-directed by NIPC staff?"

A:  The vendor's personnel would not be expected to "work with" NIPC  or FBI personnel, as on site, but rather, would be expected to work independently to analyze cyber threat and vulnerability information affecting networked infrastructures (see response to Vendor #1, above).  As a result, NIPC personnel would have access to the products containing the vendor's analyses or incident data.  We do not want a different costing proposal, since we do not expect re-direction by NIPC staff.

3.  Is there a small business set aside on this procurement?

R:  No.   

4.  "Can the work be done remotely - i.e. from Detroit - at a local FBI facility? or perhaps 	from overseas? or is the work to be exclusively done at the FBI building in DC?"

A:  Yes, the work may be performed remotely, but must be pertinent to networked critical infrastructure systems employed in the United States.  With the exception of the quarterly in-person summary updates called for in Deliverable 2, the final product either needs to be electronically delivered (or "pushed") to the NIPC or be electronically accessible to NIPC personnel (who currently reside in the FBI headquarters building), whichever is more appropriate.

5.  "Is there any level of clearance required for the performers?  Is US citizenship a 	requirement?"

A:  There are no requirements for vendor personnel to hold security clearances and the work need not be performed by U.S. citizens.  As a point of information, vendor personnel who visit the NIPC would be expected to undergo the same basic personnel security screening process that any vendor personnel doing business with the FBI would undergo.

Item #3

 	"General

1.  "Question: "Place of performance" is listed as the FBI Hoover Building.  You're requesting a service.  Please clarify!  Question are you requiring the analyst within Task 2 to be on site?"

A:  As stated in the response to Vendor #2, Question 4 (above), the work may be performed remotely, but must be pertinent to networked critical infrastructure systems employed in the United States.  With the exception of the quarterly in-person summary updates called for in Deliverable 2, the final product either needs to be electronically delivered (or "pushed") to the NIPC or be electronically accessible to NIPC personnel (who currently reside in the FBI headquarters building), whichever is more appropriate.

 	"Within Task #2 you request analysis support of 'security incidents'.

1.  "Question: how many 'security incidents' will we be required to support?"

A:  The NIPC has three levels of warning products; in order of increasing severity, they are: assessments, advisories and alerts (please see the "Warnings" page on the <www.nipc.gov> website).  The types of cyber security incidents referred to in the RFQ would need to be significant enough to warrant an advisory or alert.  Ideally, the NIPC would like to predict and prevent major cyber security incidents, but occasionally such incidents occur without warning.  In these cases, the NIPC expects the vendor to provide an analysis of the incident based on the best information available to the vendor.  It is impossible to predict how many such incidents would necessarily occur, but in the past three years, they have numbered between one and five incidents per year.  Examples include the "Love-letter/Love Bug Virus," the Distributed Denial of Service Attacks of February 2000, the Lion Worm,  Leave(s) Worm, Code Red and Code Red II Worms, Nimda Worm, and cyber attacks on U.S. sites as a result of politically motivated cyber conflicts.

2.  Question would you accept a FFP labor rate for this work and a block of hours?  If so how many hours should we provide?

R:  We are looking for a Firm Fixed Price per month for the services.   
			
 	"Within Task #3
 	"The federal agencies are typically not willing to share their incident database with a vendor.  FedCIRC controls a centralized federal civil incident database and is also
	typically not willing to share that with a vendor.

1.  "Please further explain what your intent is or your meaning of 'given access to existing
cyber incident databases.' "

A:  If the vendor maintains a database or databases that contain information on computer network intrusions or attacks, the NIPC desires to have access to that intrusion/attack information contained in the database(s).

2.  "Question: are you looking for access to a threat and vulnerability database with this
requirement?"

A:  Yes.

 	"Within Task #4

1.  "Question: how many individuals make up the Group Account for the Analysis Information Sharing Unit who are not part of the '(10) Individual Users Accounts'?"

A:  As many as forty (40) individuals could make up the Group Account for the Analysis and Information Sharing Unit, but it is highly unlikely that more than a few would require access to the account simultaneously; in fact, the NIPC would accept reasonable restrictions on simultaneous access to the Group Accounts.

2.  "Question: how many individuals make up the Group Account for the Watch who are not part of the '(10) Individual Users Accounts' and/or the 'Group Account for the Analysis 	Information Sharing Unit'?"

A:  As many as twenty-five (25) individuals could make up the Group Account for the Watch and Warning Unit, but many of these individuals work in different shifts and it is highly unlikely that more than a few would require access to the account simultaneously; in fact, the NIPC would accept reasonable restrictions on simultaneous access to the Group Accounts.

3.  "Question: is the NIPC looking for universal distribution rights with the federal government for all the content provided with this service?

	 	"If SO this effectively eliminates all federal agencies from our potential customer base and would end many existing clients contracts.  This would therefore greatly
		affect the price to the NIPC.
	 	"If NOT are you willing to identify the number of departments, agencies and
		organizations along with the number of people with those departments, 			agencies and organizations that will have access to the content."

A:  The NIPC does not seek exclusive rights to the content of the information provided under the contract.  The vendor may provide the same information simultaneously to the NIPC and to other clients as the vendor sees fit.  (However, the vendor should not provide the NIPC with any information later than the vendor would provide the same or similar information to any other client.)  These factors should protect the vendor's client base by providing clients with a greater quantity of the vendor's information, and to do so more quickly, than a possible turn-around of some of the vendor's information in a later-distributed NIPC product.  The issue of the NIPC's re-distributing vendor information would arise only infrequently and in conjunction with the NIPC's need to issue urgent warning products to owners and operators of critical U.S. infrastructures.

Item #4

Task 1:  Security Threats and Trends - The contractor shall provide services to the NIPC that will allow the user to predict infrastructure related security threats or trends.

Deliverable 1:  The contractor shall provide the NIPC access to data that should include, but not be limited to, an apparent source of attack - country, Internet Protocol address, service provider, time, date methodology, motivation (if apparent).  Furthermore, future changes in requirements or information will be determined on an "as needed" basis by NIPC.  Access to this data may be in the form of telephone, e-mail or pager alerts, as well as database access.

Questions:

1.  What is the source of the attack data? (NIDS, HIDS, firewalls, honeypots, or other?) Are these products commercially available or proprietary to the NIPC/Government? (COTS or GOTS)

2.  How many devices of the above types?

3.  How will the data be provided to the contractor?  Direct read access to the device, access to a centralized data aggregation resource (like management stations or an event database), FTP, email, fax, phone call, etc.

4.  Will the attack data be available in near real-time, or available for batch upload/download?

5.  Will all raw data be provided, or incident based data sets?

A (1-5):  For this RFQ, the NIPC expects the vendor to be able to provide its own sources for lawfully gathering intrusion detection and related information, independent of the NIPC, and all analysis would be performed at the vendor's facilities.

Task 2:  Analytical Support - The contractor shall perform qualified analysis and assessment of information security incidents to the level of detail as dictated by the NIPC.

Deliverable 1:  Results of the analysis and assessments will be provided in a timely manner in the form of  white papers, presentations or other mediums so stipulated.  See Task 4 for Redistribution.

Deliverable 2:  Shall provide monthly electronic briefings on recent trends, patterns, vulnerabilities, and attack tools, as well as quarterly in-person summary updates.  In addition, daily notifications will be supplied as the result of any vulnerability or attack the contractor encounters and deems significant.

Questions:

1.  Will analytical support be required 24/7?  We have a standard offering for such requirement if the FBI believes this to be prudent use of people.

A:    The NIPC does not stipulate or require that a particular staffing level be used, so long as the results prove accurate and credible for cyber warning purposes.  The NIPC expects the vendor to provide unclassified analyzed intelligence on newly discovered cyber threats to and vulnerabilities of hardware and software in common usage by critical elements of information and telecommunications infrastructures in the United States.  The purpose of such intelligence is to warn owners and operators of those infrastructures what cyber threats and vulnerabilities they should be most concerned with (i.e., what cyber threats and vulnerabilities would pose the most significant risks) and what measures, if taken, would reduce or eliminate the risks associated with those threats and vulnerabilities.

2.  Does the NIPC expect or desire a single POC or program manager for all contact and on-site meetings?  Can we include this billet in our response to the RFQ?

A:  Yes (to both questions).

3.  Will there be any requirement for on-site staffing other than the quarterly meetings?

A:  No.

4.  Will the monthly electronic briefings be conducted via a particular technology or system, or is it at the vendor's discretion?  (for example; WebEx, NetMeeting, PowerPoint and a conference call, other.)

A:  Monthly briefings may be conducted either by email to designated individuals (preferable) or by conference telephone call.

Item #5

1.  Do you intend to hold a bidders meeting?

A:  At this time we are not planning to hold a bidders' meeting.

2.  Can you estimate the number of users within each of  the Analysis Information Sharing Unit, and the Watch Unit?

A:  As many as forty (40) individuals could make up the Group Account for the Analysis and Information Sharing Unit, and as many as twenty-five (25) individuals could make up the Group Account for the Watch and Warning Unit, but it is highly unlikely that more than a few would require access to the account simultaneously; in fact, the NIPC would accept reasonable restrictions on simultaneous access to the Group Accounts.

3.  Do the members of the Analysis Information Sharing Unit, and the Watch Unit include contractor personnel?

A:  Yes.

4.  Task 2 requires services as directed (from time to time) by the NIPC.  Do you want this cost identified separately, or blended into the subscription costs of CLINs x001 through x003?

A:  We want them blended into the subscription costs.

5.  Will you accept multiple priced options?

A:  Yes.

6.  With regard to the NIPC/FBI solicitation RFQ-075050.  Can you clarify what we are required to represent and certify?  Are we supposed to pull something down from the FBI/NIPC web site?

R:  All offerors responding to this solicitation are being requested to complete FAR Provision 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items. (APR 2001).  This Provision can be retrieved from the General Services Administration's, Federal Acquisition Regulation website at Internet address http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  This Provision is pertaining to information concerning your company such as:  Business Size, TIN, etc.   
  
Item #6

Should the contractor implement and/or monitor an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) within the NIPC environment to gather threat data?

A:  No, for this RFQ, the NIPC expects the vendor to be able to provide its own sources for lawfully gathering intrusion detection and related information, independent of the NIPC, and all analysis would be performed at the vendor's facilities.

Item #7

1.  The RFQ asks for responses by 27 August.  Would you consider extending that date?

R:  The date has been extended until 4:00 p.m., EDT, September 3, 2002.

Item #8

1.  Is there an incumbent for this requirement?  If so, who is it?

R:  Yes, Security Focus.

2.  Is the due date still Tuesday, August  27, 2002?

R:  The due date is now September 3, 2002 by 4:00 p.m., EDT.

3.  Is this a set-aside?  Estimated size?

R:  No.  Any contractor who can meet our needs is invited to submit a proposal.

4.  Is there a program manager we can speak with regarding this opportunity?

R:  It is preferred that you do not speak to the program manager, but the questions that were received off the Internet via e-mail concerning this solicitation are being responded to by the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer Technical Representative.           

Item #9

1.  I am interested in finding out if there is an incumbent contract on the Internet Information Security Subscription Services requirement. If so, would you mind providing me with the following incumbent information?

Contractor -		R:  Security Focus
Contract # -		R:  J-FBI-02-067
Award Date -		R:  5/24/02
Expiration Date - 	R:  9/30/02, but it can be extended up to 3 months
Award Amount - 	R:  $218,000

Item  #10

1.  Is there an existing vendor providing these services or services similar in scope to NIPC?

R:  Yes, see Items 8 and 9.
 
2.  In general, there is very little information on the scope of services related to each of these tasks.

Question:  Will NIPC release more specific scope information including detailed services required, description of existing environment, etc., to enable vendors to provide more relevant responses?  If not, why?

A:  The NIPC cannot accurately predict what the most significant Internet-based network vulnerabilities and threats would be in the future, and yet, those very same vulnerabilities and threats would drive the frequency and number of NIPC warning products.  The NIPC expects the vendor to provide unclassified analyzed intelligence on newly discovered cyber threats to and vulnerabilities of hardware and software in common usage by critical elements of information and telecommunications infrastructures in the United States.  The purpose of such intelligence is to warn owners and operators of those infrastructures what cyber threats and vulnerabilities they should be most concerned with (i.e., what cyber threats and vulnerabilities would pose the most significant risks) and what measures, if taken, would reduce or eliminate the risks associated with those threats and vulnerabilities.  The NIPC does not stipulate or require that a particular methodology be used to arrive at such intelligence, so long as the results prove accurate and credible for cyber warning purposes.
							
3.  Deliverable 1 states "The contractor shall provide the NIPC access to data that should include, but not be limited to, an apparent source of attack - country, Internet Protocol address, service provider, time, date, methodology, motivation (if apparent).  Furthermore, future changes in requirements or information will be determined on an as needed basis by NIPC.  Access to this data may be in the form of telephone, e-mail or pager alerts, as well as database access."

Question:  Does NIPC have the data sources referenced above or is NIPC looking for external data sources provided by the vendor?  Can NIPC provide examples of the internal or external data sources sought?

A:  For this RFQ, the NIPC expects the vendor to be able to provide its own sources for lawfully gathering intrusion detection and related information, independent of the NIPC, and all analysis would be performed at the vendor's facilities.

4.  Does NIPC have existing products/data sources and vendors in mind for the specific threat information it seeks?  If so, what/who?

R:  There is an incumbent, Security Focus (see Items 8, 9 and 10), but as for this solicitation, any contractor who can meet our needs will be given every consideration for award.

<DESC>DESC: SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT  The National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested identifying Small Business organizations having the ability to develop and evaluate scalable, high precision multi-axis robotic aids capable of providing reasonably priced rehabilitation services to individuals with upper and low extremity limitations.  The goal of this project is to incorporate the latest neuro-rehabilitation computer software and electrical/mechanical engineering to produce new three-dimensional high precision interventions in varying sizes for upper and lower limbs for use in home as well as clinical settings.  These devices must be able to move a limb passively and safely through a range of motion for an extended period of time.  To receive consideration for a contract award, a small business must be able to meet the following prerequisites: 1) Have engineering capacity to develop  or obtain and modify existing robots to incorporate naturalistic e multi-joint movements for specific medical rehabilitation intervention; 2) Have access to trained health care personnel with the ability to access an appropriate patient population, initiate treatment, provide training and evaluate patient progress; 3) Possess skills to develop appropriate software to insure patient safety, user feedback and meaningful clinical profiles; 4) Have a mastery of human factors or behavioral science in both upper and lower limb movement; and 5) Be cognizant of medical rehabilitation to guide specified interventions for patients recovering from a stroke, broken hip or similar infirmity. 6)Have access to an interactive clinical setting where the doctors and engineers performing this project can observe patients and be able to detect imperfections in prototype devices. This will allow them to use patient feedback as well as their own rehabilitation experience and education to make adjustments needed to achieve naturalistic, multi-joint movements that mimic those of the general population. Any organization which feels it has the qualifications described above should submit a response (no more than ten (10) pages), including the name of its Principal Investigator and senior participants, business size, availability  of and description of facilities, access to patient population, brief summary of proposed robotic machinery, and description of management structure.  Resumes of personnel listed in your response should be provided as an attachment.  All responses must be received by 3:00 P.M.  on October 15, 2002.  They should be address to Robert Stallings, Contract Specialist, NIH, NICHD, CMB, 6100 Executive Bldg., Room 7A07, 9000 Rockville Pike, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland 20892.  Questions may be e-mailed to the point of contact listed below.  Robert Stallings, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-6965, FAX 301-402-3676, e-mail bs79d@nih.gov.

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Michael B. Smith, Contracting Officer, (202) 273-8767
<DESC>The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) has a need for information on a COTS or pre-existing solution /system to support the process, data, and reporting requirements associated with VBA budget formulation.  The solution must be a responsive, scalable system that improves access to budget data; reduces manual efforts associated with federal budget formulation; improves the consistency, accuracy, and audit capability of the budget; supports rapid implementation of funding guidance; provides what-if capability for multiple scenarios; and links formulation with execution.   The system must also support a collection of budget and performance-related information, ensure conformance with budgetary controls and guidance, calculate costs (to include payroll), allocate costs, support decision-making, provide audit trails of changes, and provide reports. Finally, the system must include delivery of the VBA budget module, installation of the system on the VBA information technology (IT) infrastructure, the loading of all tables and stored variables in the database necessary to support the FY 2005 budget formulation cycle, and training. This is a Request for Information only; there is no solicitation or RFP to request, so no such requests will be honored.  In addition, no additional information is available at this time, so no telephone calls related to this RFI will be honored.  If you have a system that meets the requirements above, please provide the requested information to:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefits Administration, Office of Resource Management (24), Room 620L, Attn:  Budget Formulation RFI, 810 Vermont Ave NW, Washington, DC 20420-0001 by  Sep 20, 2002.  Interested vendors should provide costs estimates for software and hardware, installation, licensing, training and system support requirements.  The cost estimates should include all life-cycle costs associated with the system, your GSA Federal Supply Schedule number, or other Government wide contracts this system is available through.  The VBA intends to review the information in an effort to determine the availability of COTS/pre-existing solutions to meet this requirement.

<SUBJECT>99--Pacific Datalink FIT Support Services
<SOLNBR>2709
<RESPDATE>092602
<CONTACT>Thais Campbell, 202-366-0597
<DESC>The FAA's Oceanic and Offshore Integrated Product Team has developed and implemented controller-pilot data link communications (CPDLC) services in FAA-operated Pacific oceanic airspace.  In conjunction with Future Air Navigation System (FANS) avionics-equipped aircraft, CPDLC provides the means for controllers to communicate with aircrews via data link.  The FAA, in cooperation with the Japanese Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB), co-chairs the Informal Pacific ATC Coordinating Group (IPACG) in the North/Central Pacific, and in cooperation with New Zealand, Australia, French Polynesia, and  Fiji jointly hosts the Informal South Pacific ATC Coordinating Group (ISPACG) in the South Pacific.  These two groups have established FANS Interoperability Teams (FITs) with a mandate to facilitate this developing technology's use among all the airlines, States, and air traffic service units involved.  The FITs require support services to achieve their important goals of problem resoluti! on, system performance assurance, and planning and testing of operations that will enable the realization of benefits for all FANS users and oceanic data link stakeholders operating throughout the Pacific. These support services have been provided by the Boeing Company (Boeing) under a fixed-price, short-term contract that was awarded July 1, 2000, and expires June 30, 2002.  The FAA has a critical need for follow-on efforts to meet the continuing need for technical support services, which is estimated to cost $250,000 per year for five years of support.  Because the work is expected to decrease as experience increases, and because the need may disappear entirely before the end of five years, the period of performance for this effort will be from date of award through 30 June 2003, with four options for renewal of one-year each. The continuing effort includes meeting several critical deadlines, requiring use of a contractor with expert knowledge of FANS implementation, as we! ll as past and planned IPACG and ISPACG FIT activities. Experience has also shown that we must use a contractor with hardware and software capable of full-fidelity simulation of the flight management systems of Boeing aircraft in service in the Pacific.  The contractor must also provide full-fidelity real-time CPDLC facilities that can communicate with airborne, and test bench equipment in several US facilities via satellite.  The FAA requires support services to maintain the database of system problem reports and performance data submitted by Pacific stakeholders (e.g. data link service provides, satellite communications service providers, airframe operators, avionics manufacturers and air traffic service providers.) The contractor will be responsible for the evaluation, investigation, and recommendation of disposition of problems to IPACG and ISPACG FITs.  This effort requires sophisticated decoding software to assist in evaluating CPDLC communications. Interested contract! ors shall respond with a technical statement of experience and proven capability of working with technically equivalent systems and international groups in a similar environment, and a proven record of providing timely and efficient technical support services. Responses must be received no later than September 26, 2002.  If interested, please contact the FAA Contracting Officer, Ms. Thais Campbell via e-mail at thais.campbell@faa.gov. <P>

<DESC>The Government is planning to award a contract to certified 8(A) firms (including Native Alaskan Americans) for the construction of two (2) waterfront fuel handling facilities that will transfer fuel to and from fuel tankers berthed at Delta and Echo Piers respectively, to and from COMNAVMAR storage tanks located at Sasa Valley and Tenjo Valley, Guam, Mariana Islands.
More specifically, the subject project will provide three (3) 8-inch diameter mechanical fuel loading arms at Delta Pier and another three (3) 8-inch mechanical fuel loading arms at Echo Pier.  The work will include providing structural support to the loading arms, pier modifications, and piping connections to existing fuel manifold systmes at each pier.  The work will also include providing a micronic filter vessel, rated at 150 psig, in the JP-5 fuel handling system replacing existing sump pumps, one at each pier.
Because the facilities to be provided are waterfront fuel handling facilities, qualified contractors must have prior experience with installation of fuel related equipment/systems/
piping in highly corrosive salt water environments.  Also, since all welds provided under the subject project will be subjected to non-destructive testing and evaluation, qualified contractors must have this type of specialized experience.  Estimated range of construction: between $1M and $5M.
Qualified, certified 8(a) firms, interested to be considered for this project are requested to submit evidence of past performance/experience for at least 2-3 projects similar in scope, dollar value, and remote location by the dead line of 12 September 2002 to the attention of Mrs. King, PACNAVFACENGCON, A-e/Construction Contracts Branch, 4262 Radford Drive, HONOLULU, HI 96818.

<DESC>Request for Information/Information Exchange

Background:  As a result of a Type II Business Case Analysis (BCA) conducted by the Army Audit Agency, the Soldier Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM) was tasked to lead Army's reengineering effort for OCIE and Central Issue Facility (CIF) operations. They coordinated with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP)/Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), which led to a greater DLA role in continuous process improvement.  DLA supports approximately 54 Army Central Issue Facilities (CIFs) worldwide, including 25 CONUS CIFs, with over 100 different items covering 1,000 National Stock Numbers (NSN). Sales to the CIF community totaled $59 million in FY97, $70 million in FY98, and $78 million in FY99. DLA has taken initiatives to improve support for Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment (OCIE) for its' customers.  Army and DSCP have formed an Integrated Process Team (IPT) to further explore the recommendations of the BCA as it indicated substantial savings were possible through DLA taking over inventory and the operations of Army Central Issue Facilities (CIF) and Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment (OCIE).  Subsequently, the initiative gained further visibility in Europe, the Pacific, and in CONUS.  USAREUR DCSLOG asked DLA to investigate ownership of used OCIE as well as the possible assumption of day-to-day operations at Army CIFs and to conduct a similar study for support in the Pacific.
  
Three scenarios were offered, all economically viable:  

1)	DLA takes ownership of OCIE stocks and assumes management of CIFs through 3PLs, keeping existing Status Quo business rules.
2)	DLA owns CIFs and inventory, but streamlines CIF 3PL contracting processes to central DLA resources.  
3)	DLA owns CIFs, and develops strategic reengineered wholesale-retail supply chains, as already begun in Europe and Korea, and as is commonly found among best commercial practices of successful companies.  DLA can potentially benefit from this last scenario by optimizing requirements, acquisition and supply operations.  Support requirements are consolidated directly from retail customers, direct customer billing can reduce duplicative billing/inventory reconciliation requirements and customer ordering and return policy costs.  Further, more accurate inventory stock level determination is possible due to aggregation of demands and efficient group buys.

The conclusion of the BCA is Scenario 3, transfer of the OCIE inventory and management responsibilities of CIF operations through 3rd party logistic providers to DLA, is the best Alternative, and will potentially improve economies and business operations for both the Army and DLA.  Key improvements include:
?	Streamlining to 'one supplier, one customer.'
?	Elimination of redundant supply management operations and inventories.
?	Better asset visibility and control.
?	Better Demand Forecasting for vendor-wholesale-retail requirements.
?	Improved supply effectiveness for both inventory and financial planning.

Important management considerations such as the need to develop reasonable time frames for developing needed item management information systems, item physical transfers to single points of issue, and accounting adjustments for stock ownership need to be addressed.  Also, detailed coordination between the Army and DLA is required to ensure Army forward stock locations adequately meet operational requirements, possibly in excess of standardized economic order quantity calculations.  		

There are many obvious benefits to such a system.  DSCP would gain the tools it needs to implement a just-in-time inventory system through more accurate forecasting.  For the first time ever, true total asset visibility could be achieved in the OCIE arena.  In addition, excess inventory could be reduced or eliminated throughout the pipeline.  This system would also support a deployment scenario much more efficiently than today's local property book CIF environment.  A soldier could deploy without advance notice and not have to deal with the burden of completely clearing their equipment at his or her home duty station.

Next Steps:  DLA and the Army are conducting an in-depth Type I BCA. This is being conducted to validate the findings of the Type II BCA.  It will do so by substantiating the proposed cost savings obtained by re-engineering the CIF supply chain processes and by the assumption of OCIE asset ownership by DLA at the CIF level. In substantiating the cost savings, it is required to develop an optimized regional distribution network with a quantitative analysis of the transportation channels identified to support that network.   A clear definition of the 'to-be' model will be defined.  A data call to all CIFs will be conducted to identify actual costs.  Should the findings of this analysis show such a program to be viable, DSCP will initiate a pilot program at a site mutually selected by DLA and the Army.

The Government is also engaging potential solution providers to obtain feedback.  We are interested in sharing our project concept, obtaining industry interest, exchanging ideas about possible solutions and promoting industry consideration as a third party logistics provider.

Information Exchange with Industry:  DSCP is scheduling an Information Exchange with interested parties in an attempt to identify and exchange critical elements in the development of this project should the findings of the Type I Analysis so indicate.  This exchange will take place at Defense Supply Center Philadelphia on September 12, 2002.

For additional information regarding participation in this exchange, contact Rose Crognale at 215-737-3073 or rcrognale@dscp.dla.mil.

<DESC>Participants are being sought in an ever-changing program of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) called Distributor Partnership. We have issued three distributor partnership solicitations to date. Each solicitation has been slightly different in an attempt to improve upon the previous edition. 
The past Distributor Partnership solicitations were designed to take advantage of commercial off the shelf (COTS) items being held in stock to support commercial customers. Because the items were supposedly already stocked, the solicitations allowed only Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) to our customers based on a 3 or 10-day delivery period and limited the contract length to 18 months with firm fixed prices for the entire contract period. The initiative has had limited success to this point. What we?ve found is that the majority of our items don?t lend themselves to 3 and 10-day delivery because the vendors don?t routinely stock the items.  The uncertainty of our demand patterns and the often times long lead times caused undue risk to the contract holder.
Many potential sources expressed an interest in expanding this concept to include the potential for shipments to government stock locations and allowing a longer contract period. We intend to formulate a new Distributor Partnership solicitation based upon responses from this survey.
Features we hope to incorporate into the new solicitation include filling stock orders for all National Stock Numbers (NSN) that cannot be delivered in a timely manner using DVD, expanding the contract term to up to 5 years, utilizing a best value evaluation instead of a ?first in? method, and only allowing for a single award per NSN. 
In order to reduce waste and make this effort as productive as possible, a modified approach will be used to determine the actual format of the solicitation(s) to be issued and to identify the candidate list of NSNs. The anticipated process will follow these steps:
1.	Simultaneously issue this letter to known interested sources and issue a Sources Sought notice in the Federal Business Opportunities web site (www.fedbizopps.gov) to explain this initiative.
2.	Obtain a list of candidate items NSNs from potential sources. (The initial list of potential candidate items is due by October 29, 2002.) Candidate items must have an NSN assigned and be managed by S9E. (Potential sources will be asked to provide a list of NSNs for validation. MS Excel is the preferred format for the list.) 
3.	The candidate items will then be reviewed by DSCC to validate that the NSN is managed by S9E, is not currently on a long-term contract, and is coded as a stocked item in our system. The verified list, along with current demand data will be returned to the source that submitted the candidate item for validation.
4.	The potential source will be asked to use the validated list to answer the attached market survey questions and resubmit the information in an electronic format (MS Excel is the preferred spreadsheet format).
5.	A review of all responses will be completed to determine the actual list of NSNs to be included in the pending solicitation(s). (The intent is to solicit on a competitive basis as many of the validated candidate items as possible.)

 
MARKET SURVEY	(Please complete item 6 after the list of NSNs has been validated by DSCC.)

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns only.  The estimated value of this procurement is between $100,000 and $1,000,000,000.  The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.  The acquisition is for drydock repairs to the USCGC RIDLEY (WPB-87328), an 87-foot patrol boat whose homeport is in Montauk, New York.

<SUBJECT>R -- Intent to Negotiate a Non-Competitive Contract Modification with AMEX International
<DESC>USAID announces its intention to negotiate a contract modification with AMEX International under contract no. 641-C-00-98-00236. This modification will extend the completion date of the contract by 12 months, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003.  The contract was competed under full and open competition and its original purpose will remain unchanged. After the contract was awarded the Mission's current Country Strategic Plan (CSP) was extended.  The modification will provide a bridging mechanism for the continued provision of highly specialized services in working closely with selected Ghanaian SME's in business linkages with larger firms and
expanding non-traditional exports until a new CSP is developed and the contract(s) for a successor project is awarded. USAID intends to negotiate this modification with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5), where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays.  This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement in accordance with numbered note 22.  Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirment to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The software must permit the user to change the following detector parameters from the computer. Additionally, the software must be capable of uploading these parameters to the detector controller and stored in both volatile RAM and non-volatile E-proms.  These parameters must include all of the following; PMT voltage, ignitor current, triger level, range and attenuation, detector zero, mode type and all gate parameters (start, stop, dual gating factors, etc).  4. The software must provide a real time display showing the waveform of every pulse in the detector.  This capability must include the ability to zoom in on various positions of the pulse for closer evaluation. 5. The detector and software must include the ability to have programmable timed events occur involving changes in the detectors operational parameters during an individual chromatographic run.   These timed events options should include changes in the following parameters; auto zero, range, attenuation, ignitor current, gate/mode type, record function, and the square root function. 6. The software must provide the capability to record and store all or selected pulse waveforms on the computer hard disk. 7.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is R39-7MN1-02 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is a small business set-aside;  The NAICS is 336212, business size 500 employees.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-08.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Livestock Issues Research Unit, requests the procurement of one Livestock Transport Trailer. 
Objectives of Research: Livestock travel to terminal processing facilities in commercial trailers for various lengths of time. Some evidence suggests that this loading, handling and movement of livestock is stressful. The objectives of this research are to determine behavioral and physiological levels of stress in animals transported in a commercial trailer as well as determine changes in quantity of zoonotic pathogens of importance in food safety.
Approach: To quantify the health, well-being and level of zoonotic pathogens of livestock during long-distance transport using a commercial trailer, a multidisciplinary design will collect data on stress parameters (cortisol, white blood cell numbers, immune indices and endocrine measures), numbers and severity of injuries, behavior and pathogen shedding. Blood samples will be collected prior to loading and immediately after unloading. Fecal samples and hide swipes will also be collected before loading and after unloading. Behavior will be continuously monitored during transport by video cameras and microphones mounted within the trailer. Accelerations of the trailer will be recorded on the video tapes to correlate truck acceleration with animal behavior.
To date, most livestock transportation research has either been carried out using small trailers or if commercial trailers are used, behavior data is not collected. We seek to understand the behavior and physiology of livestock transported under commercial conditions. In order to accomplish this we must have a commercial transport trailer that can be retrofitted with additional research equipment.
Specifications for the trailer are:
1)Fifty three foot aluminum straight-deck slat-side livestock trailer
2)102 inch wide, 13 feet 6 inch height
3)Ground loading ramp with side chutes
4)Aluminum tread plate flooring
5)Five 12V interior lights, lights near back tires for turning
6)Adjustable outside spotlight above loading chute
7)Winter kit with slats and storage box
8)Air ride suspension with gauge
9)Removable top deck, aluminum 2 ? inch planking mounted at middle height point of the trailer, with fold to wall ramp
10)5 split, (upper - lower) removable compartment gates with no gap present when joined. Upright posts should be able to accept the mounting hardware for the gates.
11)4 side open doors, two on each side - all staggered from each other
12)Heavy duty, low profile tires mounted on steel rims
13)Hub-o-meter installed on wheel
14)39 inch roll up door within the back door, fully open cargo back door, back door swings completely open using side hinges
15)King pin 36 inch setting, front drop 6 inch
16)Drop leg landing gear
17)Spare tire carrier
18)Under trailer storage box, access doors on both sides of the trailer - 2 doors per box. One 29" X 29" X 102" internal measurement box hinged at the top, rubber sealed (rear box). Hinges should not block access - i.e. a 29" X 29" X 48" block will pass through the box. Specify warranty type and duration.

Behavior will be continuously monitored during transport by video cameras and microphones mounted within the trailer. Accelerations of the trailer will be recorded on the video tapes to correlate truck acceleration with animal behavior.
A specially designed video recording system is required to complete this work. Several challenges arise when attempting to record behavior of animals within a moving vehicle. Those challenges include movement and vibration of cameras that reduce video quality, camera lenses that cannot view the entire width of a commercial vehicle, and low levels of light during filming. Exact specifications of the video system follow:
1)Two portable fully integrated multipurpose video/audio monitoring and recording systems for deployment on various livestock transport trailers up to 53 feet in length and 102 inches wide
2)System should fit into a 29" X 29" X 102" internal measurement box
3)Each system must fully integrate three ultra-wide angle very high resolution monochrome video cameras in waterproof housings with infrared illuminators, a GPS receiver, GPS overlay display, a triazial accelerometer and triaxial G-Force overlay display to monitor and record physical forces affecting the animals during transport.
4)The video images, an audio channel, GPS coordinates and triaxial G-Forces must all be recordable for up to 24 hours on a single video cassette.
5)Video display during recording or playback mode shall allow simultaneous viewing of all three video channels, the selected audio channel and GPS and G-Force data.
Additional Requirements:
6)Video cameras with infrared illuminators should be capable of imaging an area of 7 by 8 feet from a distance of approximately 9 inches.
7)Waterproof camera housing to have scratchproof sapphire lens with pressurized water jet system to flush lenses clear of debris from livestock.
8)All components (cameras and lenses in housings, accelerometers, microphones, cables) to be quick detachable mounted in transport trailer shall be waterproof to a depth of 10 meters and corrosion resistant so that they may be immersion disinfected.
9)All components (recorder, monitor, power supplies, GPS receiver, VITC time code generators) shall be supplied in a single weatherproof overcase requiring only 12 VDC at less than 8 amps and weighing less than 50 pounds.
10)All cables connecting the transport trailer to the towing truck shall be encased in a single ultra durable overjacket. All cables exiting the overjacket on the transport trailer end shall have numbered or unique plugs for connection to a fiberglass interface box. All cables exiting the overjacket on the towing truck end shall have numbered or unique plugs for connection to the weatherproof overcase.
11)Bidder shall supply the above as a fully integrated, pre-assembled and pre-tested system. External cables and connectors, as required, shall be pre-numbered and/or unique as to proper reattachment points. The entire system shall be configured to allow complete reassembly, installation, deployment, operation and the collection of video/audio data by the end user. Off the shelf untested boxed components do not fulfill these requirements and are not acceptable.
12)Bidder shall supply a copy of warranty, guarantee and return policy applicable to all items bid. The video/audio system shall be delivered to the USDA, Agricultural Research Service, FM Road 1294, Lubbock, Texas, 79403.
