<p>The reference for the IFIB is IFIB-ACT-JWC-19-09 and all correspondence regarding the IFIB should include that reference.</p>

<p>The JWC is seeking contracted service support to fulfill its requirement for Exercise Setting / Scenario Production - OCCASSUS, both on and off site. The services include both routine operations and surge requirements.</p>
<p>Type of Contract: Firm, Fixed Price</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate potential U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidder list for this procurement, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. U.S. firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities">http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</a></p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the text of your email</span>:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for the project. The Department of Commerce uses a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>U.S. firms should request a DOE (and, for U.S. firms new to NATO ICB, submit the one-time NATO ICB application): 26 March 2019</p>
<p>NATO contracting office issues IFIB (planned): 15 April 2019</p>
<p>The NATO contracting office will directly email this IFIB to all firms on its bidders list and will post the IFIB on the following website: <a href="http://www.jwc.nato.int/index.php/organization/contracting#Procurements">http://www.jwc.nato.int/index.php/organization/contracting#Procurements</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Bid closing (planned): 06 June 2019</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Base Period: 01 Oct 2019 - 31 Sept 2020. Option Periods: 01 Oct 2020 - 31 Sept 2021; 01 Oct 2021 - 31 Sept 2022; 01 Oct 2022 - 31 Sept 2023; 01 Oct 2023 - 31 Sept 2024</p>

<DESC>USDA Forest Service El Yunque National Forest Synopsis for Design Build Revitalization of El Portal Visitors Center Building and Site
<p>The USDA Forest Service Southern Region El Yunque National Forest (Puerto Rico) intends to solicit proposals for the award of a design build contract. Design-build (or design/build, and abbreviated D-B or D/B accordingly) is a project delivery system used in the construction industry. It is a method to deliver a project in which the design and construction services are contracted by a single entity known as the design-builder or design-build contractor. The work to be performed shall consist of the contractor furnishing all labor, materials, equipment, tools, transportation, supervision, facilities, and supplies. This procurement is 100% set-aside for small businesses. The project will consist of the design and reconstruction of the El Portal Visitors Center Building and Site. The project includes multi-disciplinary design based upon a USDA Forest Service-provided conceptual design, which will be finalized into a complete set of construction drawings, specifications, schedule of items, and construction cost estimates, and includes the building and site design that is compliant with all building codes, agency space policy, security requirements, and agency requirements as outlined. Upon final approval of the Complete Stamped and Signed Construction Documents, the building and site shall be constructed as designed and specified, according to all applicable law and requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes associated with this requirement are: 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.

<p>Basis for Award</p>
<p>Award will be made to that offeror (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable and (2) whose technical/cost relationship is the most advantageous to the Government. Evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The critical factor in making any cost/technical trade-off is not the spread between the technical scores but, rather, the significance of that difference. The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and advantageous to the Government. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. After Award, the USDA Forest Service will issue a Limited Notice to Proceed for the Design Phase.</p>

The services herein are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12- Acquisition for Commercial Items and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The resultant award for this commercial service (FAR Part 12) will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2019-01 (12/20/2018) and as required by the agency and NCI.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance, and the business size standard is $20.5 Million.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is dedicated to exploring complementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science; educating and training CIH researchers; and disseminating authoritative information to the public and professionals.  The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), Division of Extramural Research and Training is responsible for fostering quality research and training in complementary and alternative medicine and for the review of applications submitted to NCCIH.  This includes such activities stimulating, planning, advising, directing, and evaluating program activities for a portfolio of research grants, as well as, site visits to Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) research institutions.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a service contract for one (1) existing Nikon CSUX1 Spinning Disk System. The Service Contract shall include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	CSUX 1 Spinning Disk S/N 95R200027<br />&bull;	LU-N4 Laser Unit S/N 40407<br />&bull;	NIS Elements Software Updates<br />&bull;	One (1) preventative maintenance (PM) visit (per contract year)</p>
<p>Service, replacement parts, and lasers for this instrument must be compatible with the existing equipment.</p>
<p>The service contract shall cover any parts, updates, lasers, labor and travel associated with any service event.</p>
<p>The base period of performance shall be for twelve (12) months from August 7, 2019 through August 6, 2020 plus four successive, one-year options as follows:</p>
<p>August 7, 2020 - August 6, 2021<br />August 7, 2021 - August 6, 2022<br />August 7, 2022 - August 6, 2023<br />August 7, 2023 - August 6, 2024</p>
<p><br />PLACE OF PERFORMANCE/DELIVERY: The Contractor shall service the Nikon Spinning Disk System equipment, to include installation and/or delivery of parts as required, to: NCCIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The Contractor that receives the award will be provided with the complete address and contact information for the Government representatives.

<p>PAYMENT: Payment shall be made after delivery, inspection and Government acceptance.</p>

<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Nikon Instruments, Inc. under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). It is believed that Nikon Instruments, Inc. is the sole service provider that can meet the specific requirements related to servicing the existing laboratory instruments. The NCCIH Nikon Spinning Disk System must be properly maintained. Extended downtime and/or poorly calibrated equipment would be catastrophic to many research projects at NCCIH. Therefore, NCCIH is in need of a maintenance contract to ensure this instrument is performing optimally without interruption. Based on market research, Nikon Instruments Inc. was identified as the only company with the knowledge, training, and equipment necessary to perform maintenance and repair on the Nikon Spinning Disk System. Therefore, the Government anticipates a non-competitive award to Nikon Instruments as they appear to be the only vendor capable of fulfilling the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>This notice of intent/synopsis is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party, especially a small business, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Responses must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM Eastern Prevailing Time, on February 25, 2018. All responses and questions must be in writing or emailed to Randall Tiqui, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at randall.tiqui@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to continue with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls or facsimiles will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have a valid, current Entity Record, including current Representations and Certifications, in the System for Award Management (SAM), through SAM.gov.  <br />Reference N02AT91217-55 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a firm fixed-price type contract to The Northrop Grumman Company (NGC) to provide F/A-18 E/F/G with Final Critical Safety Items (CSI) Piece Parts," doublers, fittings, stiffeners, and shims. The supplies and/or services are required to support the assembly of the final (84) AFC-582 A1 kits.
<p>The procurement will be procured under NAICS 336413 (Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing), and is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority 10 USC 2304 (C)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The Government does not currently possess the necessary supplies and/or services to support assembly of AFC-582 A1 kits using a source other than NGC. Therefore, NAVAIR has determined that award of ECP 63227C3 to any source other than NGC would result in unacceptable delays to fielding this requirement.</p>

Responsible sources may submit a capability statement with sufficient detail that clearly demonstrates the capability to produce the required products no later than 3:00 PM (EST) February 26, 2019 to bret.middleton@navy.mil</p>

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Washington intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a Firm Fixed-Price Construction contract for P265 Hangar and associated facility to support research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT and E) of Unmanned Carrier Launched Aerial Surveillance Systems (UCLASS), at Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River, Patuxent River, MD.

Project Description:

The project proposes construction of a new 80,000 square foot hangar and associated facility to support research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT and E) of Unmanned Carrier Launched Aerial Surveillance Systems (UCLASS) and to be located on the primary airfield at Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River.
  The construction will be based on full construction documents and specifications developed through a separate design bid build contract.  The hangar consists of shops, maintenance administration, squadron administration/operations, and hangar bay spaces to support the program. The hangar bay will be approximately 21,500 square feet and will accommodate three (3) aircraft, two (2) with wings extended and one (1) with wings folded.  The remainder of the hangar will consist of two levels housing the Squadron administration and operations spaces, providing laboratory spaces, shop spaces, offices, conference rooms, and other mission spaces to support the project program.  The site development will consist of a 260 space parking lot, structural storm water management facilities, associated utility infrastructure, and airfield apron and taxiway connecting the hangar to Runway 06-24.
  

The shell of the facility is comprised primarily of masonry materials so as not to interfere with radio frequencies or other elements critical to the program mission, and is acoustically treated in order to minimize noise from the surrounding airfield. The control rooms and associated spaces in the facility are independently shielded against electromagnetic interference. Additional spaces requiring a high level of security are being constructed to the standards outlined in ICD/ICS 705. The site development will consist of a 260 space parking lot, structural storm water management facilities, associated utility infrastructure, and airfield apron and taxiway connecting the hangar to Runway 06-24.
   The project will include sustainable design principles in the design and construction of the facility in accordance with Executive Order 13123 and other laws and Executive Orders. Upon completion of construction, the building will be certified as LEED Silver.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">155MM Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munition (C-DAEM) <br />Anti-Personnel, Anti-Materiel Projectile (Increment 2)</span><br /><br />The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of the U.S. Army Office of the Project Manager (PM) Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for a 155mm, anti-personnel/anti-materiel projectile. The product will provide U.S. ground forces with a capability to effectively engage imprecisely located enemies within an area, emphasizing personnel and light materiel missions. This product will support the C-DAEM Dual-Purpose, Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) replacement strategy and will be delivered to the Army as C-DAEM Increment 2.
<p>The purpose of this market research is to obtain current information on the capability of potential sources to demonstrate, qualify, and produce a C-DAEM Increment 2 projectile for USFY21 - USFY25 military requirements. Multiple awards are anticipated to demonstrate the capability and qualify the design in its intended environments, followed by a contract for production.</p>
<p>The C-DAEM Increment 2 projectile must be capable of defeating personnel, light materiel, and some armored targets in a Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environment from US Army 155mm howitzers (M777A2 or M109A6/7). The C-DAEM Increment 2 must replace 155mm DPICM stockpiles with a cluster munition compliant capability which will broaden the target set, enhance lethality, and extend the reach of the current cannon platforms beyond the current DPICM capability. The Department of Defense Policy on Cluster Munitions can be found at the following link: https://www.acq.osd.mil/tc/docs/DOD-POLICY-ON-CLUSTER-MUNITIONS-OSD071415-17.pdf. Responses should be provided given the following assumptions:</p>
<p>&bull; C-DAEM Increment 2 plans a live-fire demonstration of cluster munition policy compliance by Nov 2020. Contractor will deliver 20 projectiles, half of which will be conditioned and fired at cold (-25 degrees F) and half at hot (+125 degrees F). US Government will pay for the testing cost, planned for Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona.<br />&bull; C-DAEM Increment 2 plans for qualification testing to begin in USFY22 using existing US Army 155mm Cannon Artillery Systems (M109A6/7 or M777A2), fired with the US Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS).<br />&bull; Production deliveries are planned to begin in the USFY24 - USFY25 timeframe, however incremental strategies to accelerate qualification and deliveries may be proposed. <br />A response to this survey should show adequate technical and manufacturing capability to meet the programmatic goals of the C-DAEM Increment 2 projectile. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate its ability to obtain those resources. To be considered for this effort, interested parties must provide the information requested below:</p>
<p>a) Name of company, address, telephone number, email address, and point of contact.</p>
<p>b) A summary that includes a brief description of the contractor's capabilities to include description of facilities/equipment, personnel, manufacturing process, quality system, inspection capabilities and how they directly relate to the C-DAEM Increment 2 Projectile</p>
<p>c) A description of existing or planned design approach, technology readiness level, manufacturing readiness level, production capacity, projected monthly production and delivery capability, the ability to meet or exceed technical requirements, the ability to meet or exceed the schedule goals, and if they are currently manufacturing this item or have made this item or similar items in the past.<br />d) Rough order of magnitude costs and schedule to demonstrate the capability in a live fire demonstration, qualify the design, and begin low rate initial production.</p>
<p>e) Address the design's long term viability to include a path to increased effectiveness at range, and compatibility with future 155mm guns and propellants.</p>
<p>This notice is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government. Interested firms should provide this requested information to Charlotte Sylvain at charlotte.a.sylvain.civ@mail.mil within 30 calendar days of this publication by electronic mail. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. The Government will accept written questions by email. The U.S. Government has no obligation to provide responses to this notice. All information provided will not be returned and will be held in a confidential status. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this notice.</p>

<p>"This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals or quotations. This notice is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its Centers."</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI will be treated as information only. This RFI is solely for gathering information and is not a Request for Quotation or a Request for Proposal (RFQ/RFP). Responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government arises as a result of submitting responses to this RFI or the Government's use of submitted information.</p>
<p>Vendors should clearly identify any proprietary information contained within the response so that it may be handled appropriately. The Government will not return responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration/National Center for Toxicological Research (FDA/NCTR) is a world-renowned scientific research facility established in 1971 in Jefferson, AR. The mission of NCTR is to support FDA in advancing regulatory science and to engage globally to encourage the implementation of science-based standards. NCTR conducts collaborative peer-reviewed research to support and promote public-health.<br />General Information<br />The Food and Drug Administration/National Center for Toxicological Research (FDA/NCTR) campus, located in Jefferson Arkansas, covers roughly 1,000,000 square feet and has 29 multi-level buildings and additional dorms. Cellular service to this area is spotty and weak in some areas and non-existent in other areas. Users and guests, inside and outside of these buildings require a strong cellular signal in order to place calls, send/receive texts and access data services. Many of the buildings on campus are designed to withstand explosives, creating a gap in cellular services. The FDA is seeking innovative solutions from respondents to the RFI. A complete response to the RFI should include answers to all the questions. Responses should include industry and federal examples of the respondent's best practices, when possible. Responses should include a thorough level of detail of all described technologies and how they can improve the cellular signal at the NCTR campus. <br />Questions regarding this notice should be submitted within 7 days of RFI posting and may be answered within two weeks of submission. No basis for claims against the United States government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or from the United States government's use of such information. Proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should not be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s). As part of its market research, the Government also reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to meet with or make subsequent inquiries to any firm to gain additional information on Industry best practices. <br />Responses should be emailed to Steven Chang at Tzeleong.chang@fda.hhs.gov and Teddy Weng at Teddy.Weng@fda.hhs.gov no later than 1:00 PM Eastern Time, Monday, February 25, 2019. <br />Objectives<br />The FDA is seeking a contractor to enhance the signal strength of cellular service at its NCTR campus. Cellular service is for use by both NCTR employees and guests. Optimal cellular service must be provided inside all NCTR buildings, dorms and the surrounding outdoor areas within the campus. The contractor will provide a documented solution comprised of industry best standards to achieve the stated goals.<br />Questions to be answered:<br />1. What is your stated solution for both inside and outside campus buildings?<br />2. What technical assessments would be appropriate in making a determination in solution architecture?<br />3. What are your steps to design and install your stated solution?<br />4. What kind of cabling and construction, if any, would need to be performed?<br />5. What is your estimated timeline to complete a project similar in scope?<br />6. Do you provide project management for your engineering and installation projects?<br />7. What Customer Support and Operational Maintenance do you offer in resolving customer incidents and issues pertaining to your solution?</p>
<p>Place of Performance:<br />Work will be performed at:<br />National Center for Toxicological Research<br />3900 NCTR Road<br />Jefferson, AR 72079</p>

<DESC>FEDBIZOPPS.GOV ANNOUNCEMENT:  SPECIAL NOTICE
<p>CLASSIFICATION CODE: R</p>
<p>SUBJECT:  Purchase of Open Robotics, Inc. software</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB735120-19-00689</p>
<p>CONTACT POINTS: BRIAN JAMIESON, Contracts Specialist (301) 975-8276;<br /> KEITH BUBAR, Contracting Officer (301) 975-8329</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Open Robotics for measurement software.</p>
<p>***** Sole source determination is based on the following: Division 735 has a STRS research project whose objective is to deliver robot agility performance metrics, information models, test methods and protocols, validated using a combined virtual and real testing environment, that will enable manufacturers to easily and rapidly reconfigure and re-task robot systems in assembly operations. As part of this project, Division 735 has initiated the International Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition (ARIAC). The first competition was held in 2017 and the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF) was selected through an open acquisition process to support this competition. This acquisition focuses on modifying and extending the existing software infrastructure to address lessons learned in the second (2018) competition.</p>
<p>Through the market research, OSRF was identified as the only organization with the required Gazebo experience and familiarity with ARIAC to successfully complete the deliverables in the statement of work to hold the ARIAC competition in May 2019. Not only are they the world leader in running simulation-based robotics competition, as indicated by the significant experience they have in this area by working with DARPA and others, but they are the only ones that have a deep understanding of the software and simulation environment that was used in the previous competition, since they built the system.</p>
<p>If OSRF was not chosen for this contract, a new organization would need to learn the existing simulation infrastructure and software from scratch,<br />which would likely cause the ARIAC 2019 competition to be delayed by at least six months.</p>
<p>*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services.</p>
<p>****** A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>*****Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Brian Jamieson at Brian.Jamieson@nist.gov.  All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted so that they are received at Brian.Jamieson@nist.gov no later than February 19, 2019 at 10:00 AM Eastern Time.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with MPACT Corp. 5792 Oak Bend Lane Unit 105, Oak Park, CA  91377 for the acquisition of MPACT and ANLAP software license, to be used by the National Institutes of Standards &amp; Technology, Applied and Computational Mathematics Division, Gaithersburg, MD for a period of one year.</p>
<p><br />***** Sole source determination is based on the need for MPACT and ANLAP software packages that are in use in ongoing projects within the NIST Applied and Computational Mathematics Division. NIST has built up a base of finite element modeling codes, and verification and validation tools which are dependent upon these packages. Without continued access to this software, these projects would be severely delayed, or possibly stopped, preventing the division from executing its mission to provide mathematical and computational support to its colleagues in other NIST organizational units. In addition, failure to maintain access would render past studies unreproducible, which would be highly problematical if questions about the work arise.  Licenses for MPACT and ANLAP are only available from the developer of these software packages, MPACT, Corp.</p>
<p>*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 511210- Software Publishers, with a small business size standard of $38.5 million.</p>
<p>****** A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>Description:<br />This is a request for information (RFI) issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) for information and planning purposes only. This is neither a formal Request for Proposals or Quotes (RFP or RFQ). No awards will be made from the responses to this announcement. The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request. There is no solicitation available at this time. However, should a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NRL shall arise as a result of a response to this notice or NRL's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>Objective:<br />The NRL is inquiring for potential sources that are capable of providing the following:</p>
<p>Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for Seafloor Sensing</p>
<p>The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory requires a new capability for mission support to deliver custom engineered measurement technologies designed for the laboratory to the seafloor beyond typical diver working depths out to the edge of the continental shelf (from about 30m to over 300m depth). To enable the mission, we seek to procure an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that is suitable for our unique seafloor sensing applications. The ROV system needs to be turn-key, while still allowing the flexibility to support various configurations of sensors and experimental apparatuses to perform a wide variety of operations along the continental shelf. The ROV will be used for characterization of seafloor geomorphological and geochemical processes using both optical and acoustic imagery, small-scale bathymetric surveys, in situ observations of temperature, salinity and turbulence, and the precise collection of bed samples. Additionally, while performing any mission we require streaming video from up to 3 HD cameras simultaneously. The ROV needs to perform manipulation tasks and to locate and track targets on the seafloor. A key priority is the ability to integrate custom payloads and custom sensors, so adequate power and communication connections are necessary components.</p>

<p>Responses to this notice will be used for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.</p>
<p>This procurement will be advertised under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 238210 - Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors. The small business size standard for NAICS code 238210 is $15.0M in average annual receipts over the past three (3) years.</p>
<p>General Information</p>
<p>The FDA Bothell PNWRL is located at 22201 23rd Dr. SE, Bothell, WA. 98021 and is a 2 story building in downtown Bothell, Canyon Park Industrial Park. The FDA Bothell Facility was built in the early 1980s and has had several upgrades over the years.  The facility is an active lab space.  The staffing and manner in which the agency conducts business has changed.  <br />Previous contractual work provided in the FDA building relating to the Fire Alarm system was completed on an as-needed basis. This included: <br /> <br />Fire Alarm Panel Replacement:  2017 Panel Failure replacement to: EST iO1000GD<br />Partial Removal of Halon System: 2017</p>
<p>Scope Summary</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to design and replace the current fire alarm control panel(s), conductors and associated devices at the FDA's PNWRL The current fire panel that serves the Laboratories has reached the end of its useful life and needs to be replaced. The manufacturer of the current fire alarm panel and hardware is EST iO1000GD.</p>
<p>This scope of work shall include the design and replacement of the fire alarm control panel, and all other fire life safety devices which upon completion will comprise a fully operational and code compliant system. include construction, demolition of existing system, replacement of the fire panel, all other fire/ life/safety devices, associated conduit, interconnectivity and associated requirements, and the installation of an addressable class "A" code compliant system.</p>
<p>No assumption of current systems code compliance should be made. Contractor will be responsible for complete design and installation which conforms to all current codes and standards.</p>
<p>The replacement of the fire alarm system will be accomplished while facility is fully occupied.  The D/B Team will be required to ensure minimal disruption to tenants and their mission, keep a fully functional fire alarm system in operation, the facility and tenant's safe and fully protected until such time as the new system is fully operational and ready to bring on line for facility protection. Phased installation of new system with facility being protected by more than one fire alarm system during project will be considered by GSA.</p>
<p><br />Project Description &amp; Approach</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to award a firm fixed-price, Design-Build contract for the FDA Bothell PNWRL Bldg Fire Alarm Replacement, located in Bothell, WA pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Best Value Design-Build Selection Procedures (FAR Subpart 15.3).</p>
<p>The DB team will be selected through a best value / tradeoff selection process.  During the development period from initial concept to final design the DB team will work in close consultation with GSA, the stakeholders and the CMa to ensure that all of the goals are addressed and that best value practices are utilized.</p>
<p>GSA will be contracting separately for Construction Management Assistant (CMa) services.  The CMa will be involved in the design process and will provide construction oversight expertise, estimating, change order review, cost information, functionality and constructability reviews and ePM project data entry.  There will be an informal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution including an enhanced project kick-off meeting.  All installed systems will be fully commissioned and functionally tested to ensure compliance with contract documents prior to being accepted by GSA.</p>
<p><br />Unique Situations/Risks</p>
<p>The facility location, coupled with the need for continuous operation during construction, present unique challenges for the design/build teams on the project. Facility will remain fully occupied and operational during the entire project. Life safety of the tenants will be protected at all times. No adverse impact on tenant mission will be acceptable.</p>
<p>Occupied Facility Construction</p>
<p>The replacement of the fire alarm system at the FDA Bothell PNWRL must occur within an occupied, fully functional facility. These functions include typical office work, but also include services for the general public and a courthouse. This presents several challenges that will have to be addressed by the designer and/or design/build team.</p>
<p>&bull;	All work in public spaces will need to be completed during unoccupied periods.<br />&bull;	Setup, construction, and clean-up will need to occur on a daily basis.</p>

Statement of Work for Educational Products and Services

Glossary:  In this document the following terms are used interchangeably:
Students and participants
Facilitators and instructors.

General Description of Need
VISN 12 (V12) uses a variety of leadership and personal development courses in it programs and as stand-alone learning for employees.

V12 requires products and services to teach a variety of courses to multiple VA staff in both in-person and virtual formats that are instructor-led and self-directed, on-demand.  Rather than having to purchase each course and its necessary materials separately, V12 requires unlimited access for 200 employees and up to 20 instructors to a provide to a  menu  or  catalog  of courses for a set price during a 12-month subscription period.  V12 desires that each student be assigned a  slot  that would allow them to take any of the catalog courses for a set-per person price.  This is similar to having an unlimited access pass at an amusement park, the person can ride unlimited rides for on one ticket.

The instructor-led courses will be taught by VA staff who need to be prepared and certified by the vendor as instructors.

General Requirements
Must be able to offer each enrolled student all the course content at one basic per student fee.  For example, once a student is enrolled in the vendor s program, they must be able to use all the educational modalities in the program for one per student fee.

Instructor-led courses will be taught by VA staff.  Vendor must prepare instructors to teach courses and certify them to use the product.

Certified instructors must have to option to purchase course materials as independent purchases after this 12-month subscription ends.

Online, self-directed courses must be on-demand for 24 hours and 7 days a week during the contract period.

The vendor must provide an online tracking and reporting system that provides reports on what online courses have been completed by each learner.

V12 must have the ability to enroll students into the vendor s program directly to allow them access to material. 

Courses must be sorted by the competencies they teach so that instructors can determine which courses address which competencies.

Vendor must provide suggested curricula of courses that can be taught together for students to learn a specific competency.  For instance, a curriculum for a competency might include developmental assessments, on-demand online courses, instructor-led virtual courses, and instructor-led in-person courses that work together to teach a competency. This will allow instructors to use  ready-made  curriculum of different learning products without having to research what courses work together for a competency.

Vendor must provide an option to purchase discounted copies of ready-made handouts, workbooks, guides, and other materials required for the class when those are more feasible than printing our own.

The vendor must provide a comprehensive instructor guide and lesson plans that explain how to teach the course, gives timings for durations, provides an instructor script, and offers pictures of the slides that follow along with what is being taught in the lesson plan.  

Videos for instructor-led courses should have at least 3 ways to access them:
Embedded videos in course PowerPoint slides

Must include a wide-variety of courses for leadership and personal development with various durations, including a substantial number that are less than 30 minutes in duration and some that are less than 60 minutes in duration.   This is required to promote micro-learning for busy students and will allow us to tie self-directed learning to instructor-led courses.

Students must have unlimited access to these course during the contract period, at no additional cost.

The vendor s system must provide reports on course completions.

Student must have the ability to print job aids or handouts related to the concepts taught.

Vendor must include all the materials, PowerPoint slides, handouts, workbooks, videos, polls, chat rooms, white boards, lesson plans, and any other instructional items required by the course on a pre-loaded virtual, online, instructor-led learning platform hosted on the vendor s web site.  An example would be a pre-loaded class on Adobe Connect that the virtual instructor would use to teach the course to virtual students.

Must include courses facilitation features that allow instructor to move from each section of the course seamlessly, with slides, videos, and interactive activities, etc. moving automatically with each section.

Each virtual course must use good adult-learning principles, including interactive activities and exercises that keep the student engaged with the instructor during the course and reduce distractions and student multi-tasking on non-course tasks. For most class activities, the instructor must be able to determine who has submitted an activity during class so that they call on the student by name.

Vendor must host the virtual classrooms and provide a web link that the student and instructor can use to access it.

Each course must use good adult-learning principles, including interactive activities and exercises.

Certification for Instructors (facilitators)
Must provide on demand, asynchronous online certification for instructors on all the courses offered by vendor.

Online certification should include videos examples of instructors teaching the course.

Instructors must be able to teach all the courses offered by the vendor on which they are certified on an unlimited basis during the contract period, at no additional cost.

Some of these courses are part of the curriculum for designated leadership, supervisory, and personal development programs, while others are offered as stand-alone learning.

<p>The purpose of this meeting is to provide Industry and Academia with an overview of the program and to solicit sources capable of providing technical solutions to support ATLAS. The Army has a desire to leverage recent advances in computer vision and Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) to develop autonomous target acquisition technology, that will be integrated with fire control technology, aimed at providing ground combat vehicles with the capability to acquire, identify, and engage targets at least 3X faster than the current manual process. The ATLAS will integrate advanced sensors, processing, and fire control capabilities into a weapon system to demonstrate these desired capabilities. The goal of this industry day is to provide developments achieved regarding these technologies within the traditional defense community, as well as the private sector, including those firms and academic institutions outside that do not traditionally do work with the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>The ATLAS Industry Day will focus on the following five technology areas:</p>
<p>1. Image Processing topics, including:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Target Tracking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Target Detection, Classification, Recognition, and Identification<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Personnel Targets<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Vehicle Targets<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Clutter Detection / Clutter Rejection<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Optical Flow Mitigation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Passive Range Determination<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; f. World Modeling / Digital Mapping<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Automated Ground Truthing / Scene Labelling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; h. Moving Target Indication<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I. Accelerated Decision Making / Semantic Reasoning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; j. AI/ML Algorithms<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; k. Spectral Processing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; l. Automated Image Search</p>
<p>2. Data&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Data Collection<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Military target and background data for AI/ML algorithm training<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Multiple clutter and climatic conditions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Data management/database<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Labeling and Ground Truthing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Augmentation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Synthetic Imagery<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Image Generation Tool Development<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Signature Modeling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Clutter Modeling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Porting of Tools and Models to High Performance Computing Center Processor</p>
<p>3. Fire Control<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Advanced targeting algorithms<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Automation and acceleration of parts of the Fire Control process</p>
<p>4. Ground Combat Vehicle Integration Support<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Integration of High Voltage (600VDC) power systems<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Integration of sensors and electronics</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">is offering the opportunity to enter into a collaboration to further develop and commercial it&rsquo;s novel innovation, Aqueous Uranyl Detection and Quantification Using Bacterial Cells.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Environmental uranium (U) concentrations are monitored in order to minimize human exposure, motivate environmental cleanup efforts, and enhance nonproliferation efforts. that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Current methods are not satisfactory to allow sensitive, selective, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in-situ </em>detection in a robust, cost-effective, manner. Furthermore, sensing technologies that provide detection of bioavailable U is the most useful.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Current spectroscopy methods (e.g., ICP, AES, MS) are extremely sensitive and selective, but they are equipment-intensive, costly, require skillful operation, are not robust and thus cannot be easily used for <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in situ</em> monitoring. This greatly limits sample throughput. A more recent approach is the use of antibodies and DNA enzymes with high specificity and selectivity for U. However, both systems require sample preparation and costly synthesis or purification steps. In addition, these methods cannot distinguish the amount of bioavailable U (i.e., that that can transverse the cell membrane and exert toxicity). Another recent approach, a whole-cell uranyl biosensor developed in the bacterium <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Caulobacter crescentus</em> using a promoter that is activated in the presence of uranium. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>However, this promoter is not specific to U and is also activated by zinc, copper and lead.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Using native bacterial regulatory systems, LLNL researchers have developed whole-cell biosensors that can be used in aqueous samples for sensitive and selective <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in situ</em> detection of the uranyl oxycation (UO22+), the most toxic and stable form of U in oxygenated environments. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Specifically, two functionally independent, native U-responsive regulatory systems, UzcRS and UrpRS, were integrated within an AND gate circuit in the bacterium <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Caulobacter crescentus, </em>creating a<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> </em>synthetic U sensing pathway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>By leveraging the distinct, but imperfect selectivity profiles of both two component systems (TCS)s, this pathway enabled high U selectivity. </span>No cross-reactivity was observed with most common environmental metals (e.g<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">,</em> Fe, As, Cu, Ca, Mg, Cd, Cr, Al) or the U decay&ndash;chain product Th, The functionality of the sensor in an environmental context was confirmed by detection of U concentrations as low as 1 &mu;M in ground water samples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Hawaii (NAVFAC Hawaii) intends to consolidate the following two grounds and tree maintenance services contracts:

	- Contract No. N62478-14-D-2423, Grounds and Tree Maintenance Services at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (JBPHH), Hawaii

	- Contract No.: N62478-17-D-2451, Grounds and Tree Maintenance Services, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii

The contract vehicle will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with Recurring and Non-recurring work items.  The contract term will be a base year plus four option years.

The need for consolidation of these contracts has been determined to be in the best interest to provide the best overall value to the Government in regards to time and cost benefits.
 The two contracts being consolidated were solicited as 8(a) competitive procurements.  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) (Honolulu Office) advised there are several 8(a) firms that can provide grounds and tree maintenance services.  This has been proven by the number of proposals received whenever NAVFAC Hawaii has issued competitive 8(a) procurements for grounds and tree maintenance services.  Thirteen proposals total were received for both contracts when solicited separately.  SBA indicated it is unlikely they would support a release of the subject services from the 8(a) program.  The consolidated grounds and tree maintenance services contract will remain in the 8(a) program.

<DESC>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to use the procedures of FAR Part 13.501(a) to award a fixed-price purchase order on a sole source basis to Structure Retail Products.com for enterprise-wide subscription to the Structured Retail Products website and its Application Programming Interface (API).   The SEC requires subscription to the website database and API for analysis and reporting on the specialty industry of Structured Retail Products.  The database provides analysis of underlying instruments, information about projected risk/returns, and a variety of stats and fields that allow for analysis of risk and type of investment.  Structured Retail Products.com is the only known source that provides all of the required information and an extensive accompanying database with 15 years of data.
<p><br />The total estimated value of the contract is below the dollar threshold in FAR 13.5 for the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The period of performance for the purchase order is anticipated to be one (1) Base Period of 12 months and four (4) Option Periods of 12 months each.</p>
<p><br />The SEC intends to award a purchase order to Structured Retail Products.com on or about February 4, 2019. This notice is not a competitive request for proposals.  A competitive solicitation will not be issued. However, the government will give consideration to interested parties that identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals by the response date of this notice.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent for Other than Full and Open Competition
<p>Solicitation Number: 440-2019-SHIFT<br />Notice Type: Special Notice</p>
<p>Agency:   US Agency for International Development (USAID) <br />Office:   Overseas Missions<br />Location: USAID/Vietnam</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>USAID/Vietnam intends to negotiate a non-competitive modification of contract number AID-440-C-16-00001(Sustainable HIV Response From Technical Assistance (SHIFT) with Family Health International(FHI360), 359 Blackwell Street, Suite 200, Durham, NC 27701 USA. The above contract was awarded to FHI360 based on full and open competition, on June 9, 2016 for a five-year period of performance.<br /> <br />USAID's SHIFT activity is to support the Government of Vietnam in reaching UNAIDS fast-track 90-90-90 targets, wherein by 2020, 90 percent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status, 90 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and 90 percent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression. The activity strengthens human, organizational, and systems capacity to lead the national HIV and AIDS response and deliver innovative enhancements in HIV and AIDS services in the priority provinces and in transitioning to full government ownership. SHIFT reached more than 30,000 key and priority populations with evidence-based HIV prevention interventions in its year 2, achieving 129% of target and linked more than 18,000 of these populations to HIV testing and counseling.</p>
<p>The purpose of non-competitive modification to revise the statement of work(SOW) without increasing the total estimated cost is to also build capacity for Tuberculosis (TB) active case finding at the provincial level, in the same geographical areas where SHIFT currently operates. TB is a leading cause of death among people living with HIV and one of the reasons has been the lack of connection between the programs for detection, diagnosis, treatment, and management of TB and HIV. TB detection requires close collaboration between the HIV and TB systems. The expanded SOW will integrate HIV and TB services at the district and commune levels that will help enhance the quality of HIV and TB care and treatment while reducing program costs.</p>
<p>USAID/Vietnam intends to negotiate non-competitively with only one source (FHI360) under the authority of USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) 706.302-70(b)(2) which states that "An award of $250,000 or less by an overseas contracting activity" needs not to obtain full and open competition when it would impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the purposes of foreign aid, relief, and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals. However, the Government may consider all expressions of interest received within fifteen (15) calendar days after date of publication of this notice. A determination not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice, if any, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information or responses received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Therefore, any responses to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to USAID and would not hinder USAID/Vietnam's objectives.  Please direct any responses to this notice to Mr. Gregory Wang, Contracting Officer, at gwang@usaid.gov with a copy to Ms.Nalinee Wichetthumsak at nwichetthumsak@usaid.gov.</p>

<SOLNBR>140G0319R0003
<CONTACT>Lewandowski, Gerald
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, United States Geological Survey, Sacramento Acquisition Branch, plans to contract by means other than full and open competition. The United States Geological Survey intends to make a non-competitive firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Gurlap systems Limited., located in the United Kingdom for seismic equipment described in the attached salient characteristics.
 
Background
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement to purchase earthquake and volcano monitoring systems, including integrated systems (containing both sensors and data acquisition units (DAUs)) and systems comprised of separate DAUs and sensors (either strong motion sensors or broadband sensors).  This equipment will be used in the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS), the Global Seismographic Network (GSN), and the USGS Volcano Program to serve the needs of earthquake and volcano monitoring, engineering, and research communities as well as national, state, and local governments, emergency response organizations, and the public.  Applications of these devices may include urban and rural free-field and reference sites, and other types of networks, such as volcano monitoring and broadband networks.

Specifications
Note: The systems must be existing, upgraded, or improved versions of models which can be purchased off-the-shelf and of a type or types that have been utilized in previous deployments for periods of not less than six (6) months. 

The required instrumentation systems consist of three components: (1) a triaxial force-balance accelerometer, triaxial strong-motion velocity seismometer, or triaxial broadband seismometer (the sensor); (2) a DAU, and (3) software for communicating with deployed units.  When the DAU and sensor are integrated into a single package, the system is called a DAS (Data Acquisition System).  These specifications are organized by sensor, DAU, environmental and packaging issues that apply to both sensors and DAUs, software, and additional requirements.  The scope of this action includes the requirement to provide all of the instrumentation components which includes but may not be limited to cables, connectors, related accessories and ancillary equipment.  Software must be included with all DAUs and DASs if required for data acquisition.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The government reserves the right to award item by item, or in groups of items, or in aggregate, whichever is most advantageous to the Government.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Shoe Covers, Disposable. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1809-83_Shoe_Covers_Disposable are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Shoe Covers, Disposable products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1809-83_Shoe_Covers_Disposable. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 30 Mar 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MS-1809-83_Shoe_Covers_Disposable, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Shoe Covers, Disposable.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Shoe Covers, Disposable. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $358,160 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MS-1809-83_Shoe_Covers_Disposable who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />1. SHOE COVERS, DISPOSABLE BOOT STYLE UNIVERSAL SIZE / 260,460 /<br />2. SHOE COVERS, DISPOSABLE SHOE STYLE UNIVERSAL SIZE / 871,505 /<br />3. SHOE COVERS, DISPOSABLE SHOE STYLE X-LARGE / 381,550 /<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor instructions for Submission of DAPA Log and Commercial Pricing information</span><br />3. Vendor must submit a DAPA Log via the DAPA Management System (DMS) Manufacturer's Application including all offered items and relevant base uncommitted pricing for each. Submitted log base uncommitted pricing must correlate directly to that on the IA FBO Package Worksheet for all offered items. Vendors must send a screenshot of their submitted DAPA Log or of the required items already on their existing DAPA. Screenshots must be received by the MMESO POC's by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /><br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Commercial pricing will help DAPA administrators make a fair and reasonable determination. To assist DAPA administrators in identifying Standardization submissions via e-mail, vendors should cite the product line name and IA number as shown in this IA FBO announcement.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price evaluation is based on the sum of each required item's offered IA unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. If all other requirements have been met, the lowest overall price will be selected for the IA for Standardization. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes, but reserves the right to seek further discounts or request revised quotes if determined necessary.<br /><strong>&bull; In order to be eligible for selection, vendors are required to have established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line by time of selection.<br />&bull; Failure to establish a DAPA with approved base uncommitted pricing will preclude a vendor from being selected to establish an IA with the government.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />MMESO South Data Analyst, Mr. Dennis Burns, 210-536-6074, daniel.d.burns8.ctr@mail.mil and MMESO South Team Leader, Mr. David Sheaffer, 210-536-6075, david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil.

Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />1.

CAPS, DISPOSABLE SURGICAL/SURGEONS STYLE UNIVERSAL SIZE / 1,040,700 /<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor instructions for Submission of DAPA Log and Commercial Pricing information</span><br />3. Vendor must submit a DAPA Log via the DAPA Management System (DMS) Manufacturer's Application including all offered items and relevant base uncommitted pricing for each. Submitted log base uncommitted pricing must correlate directly to that on the IA FBO Package Worksheet for all offered items. Vendors must send a screenshot of their submitted DAPA Log or of the required items already on their existing DAPA. Screenshots must be received by the MMESO POC's by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /><br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Commercial pricing will help DAPA administrators make a fair and reasonable determination. To assist DAPA administrators in identifying Standardization submissions via e-mail, vendors should cite the product line name and IA number as shown in this IA FBO announcement.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price evaluation is based on the sum of each required item's offered IA unit price multiplied by number of estimated units.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br /><br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br /><br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br /><br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br /><br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Only the items requested in this solicitation will be considered for award.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>The technical factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating	Description:<br />Acceptable - Proposal meets the requirements of the solicitation<br />Unacceptable - Proposal does not meet the requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FACTOR II - PRICE</p>
<p>Price Factor.  Price will not be scored or rated.  Evaluation of price will be performed using one (1) or more price analysis techniques.  Unbalanced pricing may be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), as applicable, to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices.  Through these techniques, the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete, and balanced.  The total evaluated price will be taken from the "total evaluated price" cell on the summary tab on the Price Proposal Spreadsheet.</p>
<p>As part of the price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR clause 52.217-8) by adding six (6) months of the quoter's total option year four to the quoter's total price.  Quoters are required only to price the base and option periods.  Quoters shall not submit a price for the potential six (6) month extension of services period.  The pricing spreadsheet will automatically calculate the 6 month extension pricing based on the Option Year 4 pricing. The Government may choose to exercise the Extension of Services at the end of any performance period (base or option periods), utilizing rates of that performance period.</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p>Reasonableness.  A price is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business.</p>
<p>Completeness/Accuracy.  The offeror's proposal is in compliance with the Price Volume instructions in the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />FACTOR III - PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements.  To develop an overall rating, the Government's evaluation will take into account relevant information submitted by each quoter as part of its quote and the Government's assessment and evaluation of other sources of information.  Offerors are cautioned that the Government may use data provided in the quoter's quote and data obtained from other sources.  Other sources of information for past performance may include, but are not limited to, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) reports, the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Report System (ESRS), and other databases.</p>
<p>a.	The Government will consider the recency and relevancy of past performance information compared to the requirements detailed in the solicitation, the source of the information, the context of the data and general trends in the offeror's performance and any associated risk.</p>
<p>I.	To be considered recent, the effort must be on-going or must have been completed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>II.	To be considered relevant, the recent effort must cover a majority of the tasks identified in the PWS under the complexity of a contract vehicle requiring a broad range of tasks at multiple sites.  Cumulative simultaneous contracts may be considered in the absence of one (1) relevant contract vehicle.</p>
<p>b.	The Government will consider the extent of the quoter's ability to perform a previous contract successfully in the areas of: (a) quality of product or services; (b) timeliness or scheduling of supplies/deliverables; (c) management; and (d) regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>c.	The Government will consider the company itself, predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience and subcontractor who will perform major or critical aspects of the requirements.<br />d.	Assigning Ratings.  The past performance factor will be assigned one (1) of the ratings defined below.<br /> <br />Past Performance Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating	Description:<br />Acceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br />Unacceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>In the case of an quoter without relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)).  Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance.  In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p><br />Award shall be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p>To be considered a technically acceptable solution for a service, the quoted service shall meet the solicitation requirements including terms and conditions stated in the solicitation.   The quote shall state that all aspects of the technical requirement, including required delivery date, can be met.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate quoted pricing for reasonableness utilizing techniques described in FAR 13.106-3.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /> (End of Provision)</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.  Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.  Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.  Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations, the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.  If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).   The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.   The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.  The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.  The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.  This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

those offers are rated technically acceptable, then award will be made without further evaluating the
technical quotes of other offers.
The award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offer.
The contract will result in an award of a Firm-Fixed Priced Supply type contract.
All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract
number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted

Question:    What is the volume expected?  

Answer: What can only be provided is the number of states that are listed in the RFQ. 

Question: How many leases were written in the last 12 months? 

Answer: Due to VA Privacy  Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulations this information is not open to the public.

Question: Please give details per State and square feet. 

Answer:  The table above shows what the VA has determined. The RFQ  includes states--Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Florida, Missouri, Texas, and outlying areas.  Many of the leases pre-award, post-award were written from Real Property  Washington, DC.  The square feet is not available at this time.

Question: Is this solicitation about finding leases for the government or leasing government buildings out or both?

Answer:  Please seen Scope within the announcement.  The contractor shall support NCO 16, contracting staff, and other VA personnel, as needed in the acquisition of leasehold interests and other leasing actions, build-to-suite, oversight of construction, due diligence activities, and related real estate services.  The Contractor shall bring forward a team consisting of a) A Prime Contractor registered under NAICS 531210 -- Offices of Real Estate Agents and Brokers. Amendment A0002 changed the NAICS to 531210. The Prime Contractor will be responsible for procuring other subject-matter experts on a project-by-project basis to fulfill due diligence requirements.


Question: Do you have staffing requirements? Key personnel requirements? 

Answer: Please read A0003 page 6 regarding the staffing plan and the key personnel requirements.



Question: Can my office be virtual or does it need to be in one location? 

Answer: Please read the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice regarding the Scope page 6. This is a 'non-personal services contract' as defined in FAR 37.101. It is therefore understood and agreed that the Contractors and their employees:  (1) shall perform the services specified herein as independent Contractors, not as employees of the Government; (2) shall be responsible for their own management and administration of the work required and bare sole responsibility for complying with any and all technical, schedule, or financial requirements or constraints attendant to the performance of the contract

Question: What is the anticipated staffing needed for this solicitation?

Answer: Review A0003 page 6 Staffing plan 
Contractors must comply with personnel qualification requirements including certification, experience, conflict of interest, nondisclosure, and clearances, stated within this PWS. Performance of contract services requires expertise in both commercial real estate practices and Federal procurement regulations related to Federal lease and build-to-suit acquisitions.       Federal lease acquisitions are required to be performed in compliance with Federal lease acquisition regulations, Federal lease law, and applicable Executive Orders, and other procurement regulations, policy directives and processes listed in Exhibit 1 or referenced in this Request for Quote. For all TOs issued in support of the contract, the Contractor will be expected to sign a Conflict of Interest and Non-Disclosure Form, regardless of project type.
Contractors will provide due diligence services and other leasing acquisition support services for lease facilities. (See Modules 1 to3).
The Contractor s key personnel and project management staff are required to attend initial training determined by the PM and the CO for the implementation of this contract. Initial training will be held in person at The New Orleans Office. Meetings will be determined at a later date.  See Amendment A0001 Training.
Task Order assigned would determine whether virtual or work that would require the Broker to be physically at the facility.   






Question: Can I have a key personnel in each State?

Answer: This is a 'non-personal services contract' as defined in FAR 37.101. It is therefore understood and agreed that the Contractors and their employees:  (1) shall perform the services specified herein as independent Contractors, not as employees of the Government; (2) shall be responsible for their own management and administration of the work required and bare sole responsibility for complying with any and all technical, schedule, or financial requirements or constraints attendant to the performance of the contract; (3) shall be free from supervision or control by any Government employee, but (4) shall, pursuant to the Government's right and obligation to inspect, accept, or reject the work, comply with such general direction of the CO, or the duly authorized representative(s) thereof as necessary to ensure accomplishment of contract objectives.
Question:  What was the previous contract pricing?

Answer:  Due to VA Privacy  Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulations this information is not open to the public.

Question:   Paragraph 7 of the Solicitation states that questions are due 4:00 PM February 6th; however, Page 3 of Amendment 3 states the due date for questions is February 19th. Please reconcile. If February 19th, this only leaves three (3) days for VA to answer questions and for Offerors to modify their proposals accordingly. We recommend VA maintain the due date of February 6th or extend the proposal due date to provide VA adequate time to answer questions and Offerors to respond to answers.

Answer:  No further questions are accepted.  The closing date remains 2/22/2019.

Question: Period of Performance states  each IDIQ contract awarded will have a maximum value of $1,500,000 . What is VA s projected portfolio to be supported? Considering that VA is only considering three (3) contractors, $1,500,000 is likely inadequate to support the necessary funding for the full Period of Performance. Recommend the IDIQ maximum value be 
$10,000,000 per awardee.

Answer:  These amounts were based on market research and direction from Central Office   Washington, DC. Values will remain   Min value $1,000,000 and Max value $1,500,000.00.  Approximately 3 brokers.

Question:  Paragraph 4.a.i. states  Task Order for this Contract shall not exceed $1,500,000 . This is an appropriate Task Order ceiling; however, the total IDIQ maximum value must be increased to accommodate awardees being able to support more than one project.
Answer:  The total IDIQ maximum value is the  not to exceed  amount - $1,500,000.00.  Field work as prescribed  by Real Property has a limit on the  not to exceed  IDIQ maximum.
Question:   Recommend the definition be revised to include (vi) lump sum payments to pay for tenant improvements. As the broker manages these requirements development and inclusion of this price analysis in proposal evaluation and negotiations, we recommend that it be a component of the aggregate lease value. 


Answer:  a. Aggregate Lease Value
Defined as the fully serviced annual rent to be paid by VA for the firm term of the lease for purposes of calculating the Contractor s commission. The firm term and application of commissions are defined within this subject RFQ for each leasing project. 
The Aggregate Lease Value shall include 
(i) the initial fully serviced annual rent to be paid by VA on all space leased by VA, including base rent, base operating costs, and base real estate taxes, and
(ii) any fixed annual or other periodic annual rent step changes (either increases or decreases) and/or fixed annual or other periodic rent escalations.

The Aggregate Lease Value shall not include 

(iii) any rental abatement provided to VA pursuant to the Lease;
(iv) any annual rental escalations covering operating expense and/or real estate tax increases during the lease term,
(v) any additional amounts paid by VA for services over and above those furnished by Lessor as a part of the Lease (i.e., any amounts paid by VA in lump sum), 
(vi) lump sum payments to pay for tenant improvements, and
Commissions will not be collected on option periods or for lease terms beyond the firm term of the lease.

The VA has no rights from General Services Administration (GSA) to change, alter, or revise any definitions or terminology used in any document.

Question:  Does VA intend for Offeror s pricing to include  progress reports, TI pricing, inspections, change order preparation, review of wage rates ? These services were removed from the same PWS, awarded by the Office of Real Property as they are not germane to the activities of the NAICS code and are handled by VA s SREs and/or contract staff. Support of these services would greatly increase the commission costs. For brokers to include these costs, they would be factored into a commission percentage, which is applied to the aggregate lease value, which has great variance project to project. In addition to that, this also means developers must factor in these additional costs into their pro-forma pricing for the commission, which is an additional layer of cost to VA. Recommend these services, if desired to be managed by awardees, to be added to the Module 3 services, and quoted on a firm-fixed price basis at the Task Order level. 

Answer:  These tasks are not included and will not be added to pricing. Services with the PWS table are the tasks to be used as Deliverables.  Please read these tasks and the Inherently Governmental  g. page 8 as some actions cannot be delegated.  These items are the responsibility of the Government.
Question:  Section 9 includes mandatory/annual VA-directed training. However, it fails to require performance-focused training, typical of this scope. Considering the complexity of the PWS, we recommend NCO 16 observe the same training requirements as VA s Office of Real Property, which contractors perform identical services. Ensuring (2) contractor personnel maintain this training mitigates 
significant risk for VA. This includes:  In order to be able to bid on task orders, a minimum of two individuals proposed as a part of the team, which is directly responsible for the management of the assigned tasks will have Lease Acquisition Training, Cost and Price Analysis for Leases, Real Property Lease Law, Techniques in Negotiating Federal Real Property Leases, Best Value Trade-Offs, and Fundamentals of Appraisal Course. 

 
Answer: At this time these trainings are not offered to the contractors. The Contracting Officer retains sole discretion to allow these performance-focused trainings. Trainings such as these are e based on work load considerations. The COR will host these meetings and will be the point of contact for coordination for the meetings.

Question: Teaming arrangement information and SAM Registration are listed under (1) Pricing section. Please confirm that this information is to be included in Offeror s price proposals as applicable. 

Answer:  Teaming arrangement information and SAMS Registration are NOT to be included as items for the Price Section. Please provide this information after the SF 1449 on a separate page. Also provide original signatures within the SF 1449.


Question: Please confirm that font size in tables and graphics can be smaller than 12-pt

Answer:  .Yes    10- 12-pt.is allowable.  


Question:  Please confirm that a Cover Page and/or Cover Letter are excluded from the page limitations for each Volume.
Answer: The Cover page and or Cover letter is excluded from the page limitations.


Question: Because VA is requiring bookmarking, please confirm that a Table of Contents is excluded from the page limitations for each Volume.  

Answer:  The Table of Contents is excluded from the page limitations.  

Question:  Considering the VA s unique real property acquisition requirements, in addition to GSA regulations, recommend that the lease acquisition experience be a minimum of (3) VA completed lease projects versus  federal government leases . This will mitigate significant risk for VA in understanding and streamlining the process and ensuring strict compliance.  

Answer:  The Experience Requirements remains the same- no change.  However,  the NSUF is at least 10,000.


Question:  Considering the long VA procurement life-cycle for land acquisitions, and substantial due diligence to validate usability, recommend VA increase the time period for relevancy to seven (7) years. 
Answer:  Land acquisition are not required.

Question:  Please confirm that VA considers management of closing for land acquisitions and/or negotiation/execution of options to purchase as an equivalency of the land acquisition experience requirement.  

Answer:  Land acquisition are not required.

Question:  3.a states that Offerors must provide resumes for key personnel. Additionally, if resumes are to be included in the staffing plan, recommend that resumes be limited to 2-pages each and be excluded from the Section 3-page limitations, otherwise this will limit the amount of staff proposed and/or the quality of the narratives to address the breadth of Section 3.  

Answer:  Management and Organization, Operational Approach, and Staffing shall remain a total of 6 pages maximum. A0003 page 6


Question:  As the PPQ does not include a section to describe project relevancy, does VA require any past performance profile or descriptions in the Technical Volume, or is the requirement only for the PPQs?.  If there is some summary information required in the technical volume, please provide the page count limitation. If added, please confirm this is excluded from the page limitations.

Answer:  The answer is  No .The technical Evaluation Factors remains as is (i) Technical Evaluation Factors page 5 of A0003.  Also, what has been Removed in the Technical Evaluation Factors is  at least three (3) completed federal land acquisitions projects in the past five (5) years..  This procurement does not require any Land Acquisitions.
Within 2) Past Performance, please refer to the Past Performance Questionnaire. 
The Technical Evaluation Factors, The Quality of Services, Cost Control, and Timeliness --the total number of pages maximum is 6 pages maximum. Remains in the page limitations.  
In referencing the Past Performance Questionnaire---
Limited to 5 questionnaires maximum with one 1 page explanation of adverse past performance.

Question: Recommend VA require a minimum of five (5) PPQs, for VA-specific Module 1 lease acquisition experience.  

Answer: In referencing the Past Performance Questionnaire---
Limited to 5 questionnaires maximum with one 1 page explanation of adverse past performance.

Question: Page 29 states: All technical non-priced factors when combined are significantly more important than price .  Page 31 states:  Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal when compared to price.  Please reconcile or provide Offerors with the rating value of  Management and Organization, Operational Approach, and Staffing  factor. Recommend that  all technical non-priced factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  

Answer:  Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal when compared to price, has been removed.  However, within 52.212-2 All technical non-priced factors when combined are significantly more important than price, but, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated price becomes the determining factor.  The Government may make trade-offs between price and technical merit when determining if the increased technical merit is worth the increased price.  This factor shall remain.  Management and Organization, Operational Approach, and Staffing  factors are included as Technical non-price factors.


Question:  Staffing Plan states:  Accessible and available personnel for on-site meetings during construction within 24-hours  notice  One, we recommend these post-award construction management requirements be removed from the Module 1 services requirements. Two, this requirement is overly broad and restrictive from a pricing standpoint, given the geographic span of the PWS s scope. Having Offerors consider this requirement would significantly increase price to VA.  

Answer:  Remember Lease acquisition procedures and regulations vary depending on the complexity of an acquisition. See A0003 Module 1 is within the Combined Synopsis Solicitation. No change remains the same.

Question:  In accordance with E.4, can VA describe how eligible SDVOSBs will receive full credit? Socio-Economic status is not included in Paragraph E.2 Evaluation Factors. Is it VA s intent to consider the merits of SDVOSBs/VOSBs?  

Answer: No Full credit to any socio-economic group will be given regarding any evaluation factors.  

Question:  Page 5 of Amendment 003, describes minimum experience on Land Acquisitions; however, there are no support requirements for Land Acquisitions in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Module 1 is for lease acquisitions (with corresponding pricing for NUSF of space, not acreage), Module 2 for due diligence services, and Module 3 for various other services, which do not include Land Acquisition support. 

Answer:   Land Acquisition is removed.

Question:  Recommend that this experience requirement be removed as it is not germane to the contract s PWS. However, if these services are required, we recommend VA add this as a Module and request corresponding pricing, similar to Module 1, within the SF 1449. 

Answer:  To reiterate, Land Acquisition is removed from this procurement.
Land Acquisition is removed.  SCOPE The contractor shall support NCO 16, contracting staff, and other VA personnel, as needed in the acquisition of leasehold interests and other leasing actions, build-to-suite, oversight of construction, due diligence activities, and related real estate services.  The Contractor shall bring forward a team consisting of a) A Prime Contractor registered under NAICS 531210 -- Offices of Real Estate Agents and Contractors.  Brokers. Amendment A0002 changed the NAICS to 531210. The Prime Contractor will be responsible for procuring other subject-matter experts on a project-by-project basis to fulfill due diligence requirements.

We wanted to reach out to you regarding the pricing section.  Per the RLP, the below is the factors to utilize in the price proposal which is the maximum that can be requested as to commissions:


Small: under 30,000 NUSF 
Medium: 30,000   99,000 NUSF
Large: 100,000 NUSF or more

2. We have found in our working these transactions that there are a number of factors which would influence the appropriate commission rate such as:
1. TERM:  Normally the leases out of VACO are 15-20 years.  NCO leases usually are 10 years.   The pricing would be different depending on the longer term;
2. TYPE:  There are a variety of Task Order Assignments which would influence the appropriate commission:
a. Full and Open   replacing facility 
b. Succeeding Lease 
c. Succeeding Lease with Expansion
d. Lease Renewal
3. Fee deal commission:  Currently we have found that the National Cemetery Administration is the only VA entity purchasing property.  Since experience in purchase transactions are a part of the Prior Experience technical capabilities, it must be important part of this RLP.  We feel that Commission Structure on Purchase is different than that of a lease transaction.

Question:  The Pricing section does not make provision for alternatives which is understandable for evaluation purposes so how do you feel the above noted items should be addressed in the response?

Answer: The Lease Acquisition for Commission base Year
Option Year 1,2,3, and 4 have all changed. Please read below.  In addition, please read the Introduction and it states   . Award of this contract does not preclude the Government from continuing contracts for similar services and will not preclude the Government from awarding additional contracts for similar services in the future, in the event VA determines additional contracts are necessary.  


                                   Lease Sizes
Small
<10,000  NSUF
Medium
Between 10,000 to 30,000  NSUF
Large
Over 30,000  to 100,000  NSUF

Question:  In reference to the Broker Services NCO 16 RFQ, is the required experience with federal government leases of at least 15,000 Net Usable Square Feet (NUSF) per project? This is a high threshold for most small business concerns.

Answer:  Due to the lease sizes have changed, in addition the technical evaluations factors under (i) 1) Experience has changed from at least 15,000 NUSF to at least 10,000 NSUF.

Question:  Per amendments 2 and 3, all questions are due NLT 12:00 Noon CST February 19, 2019 and offers are due NLT 12:00 Noon CST February 22, 2019. Can the questions due date or offers due date be revised to allow ample time (more than 3 days) for the VA to respond and the offerors to submit their quotes?

Answer: The submitting of questions has expired.  The closing date remains 2/22/2019.

Question:   Introduction: This section states that award will be made to  approximately three Contractors . In the event three Contractors cannot meet the minimum requirement is it possible VA will award to less than three Contractors.

Answer:  Due to the large amount of states, 3 is approximate and it remains.

Question: Introduction: A maximum contract value of $1,500,000.00 for five years of potential services is too low. This has the potential to limit the availability of preferred contractors during the option years. Recommend changing the maximum contract value to $7,500,000.00.

Answer:   The min and max remain as is

MINIMUM VALUE: $1,000.00 per awardee 
MAXIMUM VALUE: $1,500,000.00 per awardee


                                   Lease Sizes
Small
<10,000  NSUF
Medium
Between 10,000 to 30,000  NSUF
Large
Over 30,000  to 100,000  NSUF



Question: Page 6   Scope: Does VA foresee brokers submitting revised pricing for each task order or will this only occur for projects above the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT). Federal acquisition regulations allow for direct task order issuance under the simplified acquisition threshold ($250,000.00), this will ultimately save time and resources allowing VA to have lease projects to market faster. Recommend adding language that allows VA to issue direct task orders under the SAT.

Answer:  There is no guarantee the Contractor will be awarded any additional Task Orders for project that may arise in the same geographic location at the Market Data services being performed. Offerors are advised that the commission rates proposed will set the not to exceed cap for that contract.  The contractor will not be able to propose higher commissions in the future, on any applicable task under this contract.  The contractor may, however, offer reduced rates on a task order basis at their discretion.
The assumption of one project in each category per year is utilized for evaluation purposes only.  Nothing within this section should be construed as a promise nor guarantee of future workload.

Question:  Page 8   Definitions and Terminology: As currently defined  Aggregate Lease Value  does not include  lump sum payments for tenant improvements . Does this apply to all tenant improvements to be paid in lump sum or just those above the TI Allowance outlined in the RLP/Lease. The TI Allowance outlined in the RLP/Lease, whether amortized or paid in lump sum, is a known number and part of the total lease value for the Lessor. As such we believe this should be included as part of the Aggregate Lease Value for purposes of calculating the commission.

Answer:  Aggregate Lease Value
Defined as the fully serviced annual rent to be paid by VA for the firm term of the lease for purposes of calculating the Contractor s commission. The firm term and application of commissions are defined within this subject RFQ for each leasing project. 
The Aggregate Lease Value shall include 
(i) the initial fully serviced annual rent to be paid by VA on all space leased by VA, including base rent, base operating costs, and base real estate taxes, and
(ii) any fixed annual or other periodic annual rent step changes (either increases or decreases) and/or fixed annual or other periodic rent escalations.

The Aggregate Lease Value shall not include 
(iii) any rental abatement provided to VA pursuant to the Lease;
(iv) any annual rental escalations covering operating expense and/or real estate tax increases during the lease term,
(v) any additional amounts paid by VA for services over and above those furnished by Lessor as a part of the Lease (i.e., any amounts paid by VA in lump sum), 
(vi) lump sum payments to pay for tenant improvements, and
Commissions will not be collected on option periods or for lease terms beyond the firm term of the lease.

Question: Page 22   Davis-Bacon Act Reporting of Payroll and Basic Record: Please clarify the requirement for  assisting  the Resident Engineer with Davis-Bacon Act reporting, this is not something that is typically provided under a brokerage contract.  

Answer: VA will follow the methodology outlined in FAR 52.222-8.

Question:  Page 26   Training: Please clarify if there are certain minimum requirements for training that the offeror must meet in order to receive an award. Typically broker contracts will require minimum training threshold be met by at least two members of the offerors team. Examples are: Cost and Price Analysis of Lease Proposals, Federal Real Property Lease Law, Lease Acquisition Training, Techniques of Negotiating Federal Real Property Leases, Best Value Source Selection, and Real Estate Appraisal Principles.

Answer:  Performance of contract services requires expertise in both commercial real estate practices and Federal procurement regulations related to Federal lease and build-to-suit acquisitions. Please see page 5 INTRODUCTION.  In addition, each offeror must follow the instructions in regards to the Evaluation Factors.      

Question:  Page 30   Past Performance: How many Past Performance Questionnaire Forms should an offeror submit? Is there a minimum requirement and maximum (not to exceed) figure?

Answer:  Past Performance -Limited to 5 questionnaires maximum with one 1 page explanation of adverse past performance.

Question:  Page 30   Experience: The minimum requirement states the Offerors must provide three (3) federal lease projects or medical projects completed in the past five (5) years. We strongly encourage this to be edited so that the minimum requirement states that Offerors must show experience with three (3) VA lease projects over the past five (5) years. Negotiating leases for VA clinical space requires certain experience and expertise that cannot be gained from negotiating leases for other federal agencies.  

Answer:  The Experience remains the same no change. However, the NSUF is at least 10,000.

Question:  Amendment No. 2   Page 5: Please confirm that  all non-priced factors when combined are significantly more important than price  as outlined on page 5. Other sections of solicitation seem to be in conflict with this.  

Answer:  Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal when compared to price, has been removed.  However, within 52.212-2 All technical non-priced factors when combined are significantly more important than price, but, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated price becomes the determining factor.  The Government may make trade-offs between price and technical merit when determining if the increased technical merit is worth the increased price.  This factor shall remain.  Management and Organization, Operational Approach, and Staffing  factors are included as Technical non-price factors.

<DESC>Amendment 02 - The purpose of this amendment is to revise "F. Contracting and Proposal Options for Partnerships" to clarify that choice of partnership option may also be determined based on the funding type that can be accepted by the existing ERI Performer.  As now indicated in the BAA via this amendment, in cases where the existing ERI Performer is unable to accept 6.3 funds (where the research would be restricted/non-fundamental) under this BAA, the existing ERI Performer would instead receive 6.1 or 6.2 funds (where the research would be considered fundamental) via a modification to their existing ERI award instrument.  This partnership would be formalized via an Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA). The Defense Transition Partner would still receive 6.3 funds as indicated in the BAA.<br/><br/>Amendment 01 -  The purpose of Amendment No. 01 is to correct the initial Abstract due date where it conflicts in the BAA.  <br/><br/>Original Synopsis Below: <br/>DARPA is soliciting innovative proposals to develop, demonstrate, and apply emerging technologies developed under the Electronics Resurgence Initiative. Proposals should establish partnerships between defense transition partners and the academic and commercial sectors, leading to direct and revolutionary impacts on Department of Defense (DoD) or national security capabilities. Proposals that demonstrate an established path to impacting existing or emerging programs of record are strongly preferred.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducts the world's largest biomedical research programs. NIH is one of eighthealth agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services and is comprised of twenty-seven differentinstitutes and centers. All of the institutes and centers work together under the Director of NIH to pursue the primary mission of biomedical research.<br /><br />The Division of Environmental Protection (DEP) is a support unit at NIH that is responsible for providing environmentalcompliance services pursuant to various federal, state, and local laws or regulations. One responsibility is theEnvironmental Site Assessment and Remediation initiative that began in 2002. This initiative is also referred to as decommissioning.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to award an Indefinite Deliver Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Requirements Contract to obtain the services of a qualified and experienced contractor to assist DEP with facility site assessments, remediation, demolition, and general environmental related services at NIH. &nbsp;Primary services that are anticipated to be awarded under the resultant contract include environmental feasibility assessment, site characterizations, and remediation of identified and encountered hazards which may be required to renovate or demolish NIH space. The primarycontaminant is largely expected to be mercury in various chemical and physical forms. Other facility-intrinsic or research-related hazards are expected to be incidentally remediated or abated in the process of addressing the mercury.<br /><br />Conduct investigations and remediation of possible environmental contamination and generate appropriate documentation for the NIH. All work shall be in compliance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP),the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986, along with all other applicable Federal laws, and state and local environmental regulations as identified in Appendix A of the solicitation (when released).<br /><br />The additional/incidental hazards potentially encountered are summarized in&nbsp;the Decommissioning Checklist attached to this&nbsp;solicitation. &nbsp;Furthermore, the selective demolition of facilities or other identified features may be necessary to support the remediation project. This type of service may be vital for remediation to occur and may require the use of heavy industrial equipment (i.e. crane) forcompletion.<br /><br />A preference is given to Contractors, Joint-Ventures, Partnerships and Teaming Arrangements that meet multipleservices listed in the scope of this solicitation.<br /><br />This is a construction contract vs a service contract as the intent of this award is to conduct the necessary site assessments and remediate prior to a construction activity beginning in said space.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There is no incumbent contractor.<br /><br />NO telephonic inquiries will be accepted.<br /><br />Written communication shall list "NIHOF201800050" in the subject line to ensure that it is read and addressed in a timely manner.<br /><br />Provide any written questions or comments prior to 10:00 AM EST on Tuesday, February 19, 2019.&nbsp;

<DESC>The Office of Financial Resources, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a one year cost reimbursement contract with four option years entitled "Technical, Administrative, and Logistical Support Services for Contract Technical Merit Review Meetings and Contract Closeout Support Services". This project is Set Aside for 8(a) Small Business under NAICS Code 541690.
<p>SAMHSA's Office of Financial Resources (OFR), Division of Contracts Management (DCM), is required by Congress to conduct technical review of contracts through an extramural peer review process. This requirement insures that all technical reviews are conducted impartially by a panel of highly qualified persons. The primary peer review functions include, but are not limited to, the following activities: (1) selecting qualified expert Reviewers for the technical merit review panel, (2) screening Reviewers for conflict of interests, (3) selecting hotel accommodations for Reviewers to perform technical merit review, (4) administering through a contractor to provide payments for accommodations, honoraria and other related expenses to Reviewers, and (5) writing evaluation reports of all reviewed proposals. The contract review team administers and conducts technical merit/peer review meetings for proposals submitted in response to SAMHSA-wide Request for Proposal (RFP) announcements.</p>
<p>To perform these specific functions, SAMHSA requires a contractor to provide logistical support services for support of contract technical merit reviews, which is administered by DCM.</p>
<p>In addition, DCM is required to review those projects that are announced through SAMHSA's Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract mechanism. These projects are reviewed through an objective review process. Logistical support is required for those reviews in the form of writing services, including note-taking during the objective review meetings and writing the Technical Review Summary Reports.</p>
<p>Finally, the primary function for Administrative Support to DCM is to provide not only the Contract Technical Assistant for the peer reviews, but also to provide full-time, on-site staff to fill and perform Contract Closeout Administrative Support services.</p>
<p>The estimated date for issuance of this RFP is Febraury 21, 2019 with proposal responses due March 22, 2019. The anticipated period of performance is a base period of 12 months, plus four (4) 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>The solicitation, when issued, may be obtained through FedBizOpps website at www.FedBizOpps.gov. If you have difficulty downloading the document from FedBizOpps website, please send an email request to the Contract Specialist at Carla.Carter@samhsa.hhs.gov in order to receive a copy via email. If an email request for a copy of the RFP is submitted, please confirm with the Contract Specialist by email that your request has been received. Reference RFP No. 283-19-0540.</p>
<p>The incumbent is Social Solutions International, Inc., Contract No.&nbsp;HHSS283201400004C.</p>
<p>Points of Contract:</p>
<p>Carla Carter, SAMHSA/OFR/DCM, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rm. 17E77-D, Rockville, MD 20857<br />Craig Sager, SAMHSA/OFR/DCM, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rm. 17E89-D, Rockville, MD 20857</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>41 USC &sect;253(g), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 <br />Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):</p>
<p>Export-Import Bank of the US intends to award a firm fixed price contract to Euromoney Trading Limited on the bases of other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. The estimated award date is February 13, 2019. Euromoney's Airline Analyst provides current and frequently updated detailed financial information on more than 200 public and privately owned international airlines. The Airline Analyst features analytical tool set that facilitate performance of peer comparisons, automatically processes currency conversions and can be configured to the specific needs of each user. The Airline Analyst offers a unique web based solution with analytical parameters with the processing power to deliver financial ratios in seconds for many important aviation financial ratios critical for support of EXIM Bank's employees' in credit underwriting and risk management as well as the Bank's work with exporters and other clientele. Accordingly, Euromoney Trading Limited is the only firm capable of providing the services described in Section 3 above without EXIM Bank experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements. <br /><br />6. Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:</p>
<p>In the effort to find other potential sources, EXIM Bank reviewed current similar existing EXIM bank subscription with the Center for Aviation. After review of their database, it was determined that the database does not cover the wealth of airlines or the breadth of financial data Euromoney's Airline Analyst covers.</p>
<p>In addition, Sources Sought Synopsis Pre-solicitation Notice number 83310119Q0008 was posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) to look for potential sources. The notice was posted on 12/14/2018 with response due date set for no later than 12/31/2018. Four (4) responses were received by the due date. The respondents are Euromoney Trading Limited, Deladad Advisory, DK Shin Laboratories and Centric Consulting, LLC. All four responses were reviewed by EXIM bank Contracting Officer. Review of all four respondents' capability statements is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Deladad Advisory<br />Deladad Advisory demonstrated competency in gathering data from public and private sources, the ability to build a data warehouse to store collected data and to construct a web portal. They also proposed a data analysis process. Deladad Advisory did not demonstrate expertise specific to the airline industry. Deladad is able to pull data on publicly-traded airlines, but they did not indicate that they were capable of getting information on privately-held airlines. They showed expertise on company research, in general, but not specifically on the airline industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DK Shin Laboratories<br />DK Shin Laboratories demonstrated general technical competency in developing and providing software solutions to specialized or heavy data processing and database management. DK Shin Laboratories did not address specific requirements for Airline Financial and Operational Data Analysis. No information was provided on how data collection, storage or analysis would be performed. Capabilities statement did not demonstrate expertise specific to the airline industry.</p>
<p>Centric Consulting, LLC.<br />Centric Consulting, LLC showed competence in developing, scaling, and maintaining Web based databases for numerous clients. One example of Centric's proficiency in developing Data Warehouses solutions was cited in their response; however the project is not of similar scope and size to the web based Airline Financial and Operational Data Analysis requirement. Centric Consulting did not demonstrate expertise specific to the airline industry.</p>
<p>Euromoney Trading Limited<br />Euromoney's Airline Analyst provides current and frequently updated detailed financial information on more than 200 public and privately owned international airlines. The Airline Analyst features an existing analytical tool set that facilitates peer comparisons. Euromoney's Airline Analyst currently offers a Web based database and analysis tool for global airline financial and operational data. It offers a unique solution with analytical parameters and the processing power to deliver airlines financial ratios in seconds for many important aviation financial ratios critical for support in credit underwriting and risk management. Euromoney is the incumbent contractor which provided the required services for the past five years to EXIM bank under contract number EXIM-14-P-0042. Their performance has been documented as satisfactory. They have demonstrated the ability to meet the requirements. Euromoney's Airline Analyst is a database which has already been developed fully and has a proven track record for timely delivery of data and analysis.</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:</p>
<p>Euromoney's prices are in alignment with other database costs. As the incumbent contractor, Euromoney quoted prices for each of the option periods on the previous contract at 2.5 percent yearly price escalation rate. All option periods were exercised at the priced rates consistent with the 2.5 percent escalation. Anticipated cost for the upcoming contract will be consistent with the 2.5 percent yearly price escalation which is determined to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p><br />8. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:</p>
<p>As described in Section 6 above, market research was conducted by reviewing existing EXIM bank subscription and posting sources sought synopsis notice of the proposed acquisition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: None.</p>
<p>10. Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: See Section 6 above.</p>
<p><br />11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:</p>
<p>EXIM bank will continue conducting market research to foster competition before making subsequent future acquisitions of the services being acquired.</p>
<p>12. Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Export-Import Bank of the US and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
