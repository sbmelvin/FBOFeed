<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory,  Information Directorate (AFRL/IFGD ) solicits research proposals which shall consist of the design of a complete (both ground and airborne terminals), high capacity, Radio Frequency (RF) data link.  With advances in sensor technology, the need for increased throughput over platform data links has grown.  This effort shall examine cutting edge technologies to provide maximum capacity to platforms carrying these sensors.  In particular, this effort supports persistent dominant surveillance concepts.  With this mission in mind, the data link system shall provide an all weather capability, as well as variable bit rates to support low resolution sensors/basic video applications to full download of “raw”, unprocessed In-phase and Quadrature (I&Q) sensor data.  System concepts for this application are currently immature.  Therefore, this effort shall also include an examination and analysis of system concepts to further define the use of the system in this mission.  The contracted effort shall include all phases of the design.   During preliminary design the contractor shall perform trade studies, modeling and simulation, system concepts analysis, and requirements definition leading to a Preliminary Design Review (PDR).  Following the PDR, the contractor shall advance the design with further modeling and simulation, breadboarding/brassboarding of system components, laboratory test of technologies and subsystems, and refinement of the design resulting in a Critical Design Review (CDR).  Upon successful completion of CDR, the effort shall include hardware construction of both air and ground terminals, system integration and test, and ground demonstration of the system.  The effort shall conclude with a flight test, demonstrating the functionality of the system in an operationally representative environment. Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA  solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.fbo.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing task orders for projects with an estimated construction cost of less than $2,000,000 will be included in the contract.  The Government will use the fixed price amount in the lookup table which will be a function of project size, type, and complexity.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to contract on a sole source basis with Alliant Tech Systems Division, Clearwater, Florida for requirements for developing, incorporating, and validating enhancements to the currently fielded version V22.30 of the Operational Flight Program (OFP) for the AN/AAR-47 Missile Warning Set.  (Considering the imminent fielding of the Naval Research Lab’s version 22.40 of the OFP, these enhancements would apply to that version of the OFP instead of 22.30).  These enhancements address user comments from both the Navy and Air Force, reflecting user observations compiled by the AAR-47 Software Support Authority (SSA) at Pt. Mugu and evaluated by the AAR-47 Integrated Product Team (IPT).  The resulting OFP version will be designated V30.0x, and will be compatible with both sensor configurations – Integrated Optical Sensor Converter (PN 3313-AS-700-1) and Integrated Optical Sensor Converter with Dynamic Blanking (PN 3313-AS-700-3).   Expressions of interest in subcontracting should be directed to Mr. George Fortney of Alliant Tech systems at (727) 572-3596.  See numbered notes  22 and 26.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for six rack enclosures (WB-5905) to be used in the Mobile Launch Platforms. NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from Woodbine Industries of Bensalem, PA. The subject enclosures are compatible with, and required to integrate in to the existing Ground Service Equipment subsystems, which are used to support Shuttle Processing. This hardware is required for operational use of the critical Permanent Measuring System and the critcal health monitoring network for the Shuttle Command and Control systems. This hardware will also be implemented into the infrastructure and subsystem components of the Mobile Launch Platforms.  These racks have gone through certification, qualification testing, engineering and design documentation and are in configuration. In addition, these parts have undergone environmental testing for acoustic and mechanical vibrations. Using other racks would require system recertification. There is not a like replacement that reflects the design and engineering drawings, and environmental specifications.  Any attempt to use a like part would require re-qualification, and retest for environmental specifications, at a huge cost to the government and a heavy delay to operations.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on March 28, 2007.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to conduct a wind tunnel test in a Polysonic Wind Tunnel (PSWT).	The ARES I project is preparing an aerodynamic database that characterizes the vehicle throughout the speed regime of ascent flight where aerodynamic effects are important.	This speed regime begins at liftoff and continues through first-stage separation or about Mach 6.  The aerodynamic database will be used to determine the ARES I performance, stability & control effectiveness, and structural stability.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the services from Boeing, Inc. who is the only known responsible source.  To support the assessment of the ARES I configuration, the data to develop the aerodynamic database is required over the ascent Mach range.  A 0.01-scale ( ~ 38” long) wind tunnel model has been built to test at NASA LaRC’s Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel (UPWT), for the Mach range 1.5 to 4.6.  Data is required at the lower speeds for the initial phase of ascent.  The Boeing Polysonic Wind Tunnel test covers the Mach range 0.4-1.6 providing data for the early ascent phase for ARES I flight.  This facility allows the use of the newly fabricated model, sting, and balance hardware.  There are no NASA facilities available with this Mach range and size. The Boeing Polysonic tunnel is the only known blow-down facility with the specific Mach number range, Reynolds number, and size to satisfy the wind tunnel testing requirement.  Also, in support of the ARES I program, several configurations have already been tested and databases have been developed.  The previous configurations were tested in the LaRC UPWT and the Boeing Polysonic Wind Tunnel to obtain the data to be used in developing the aerodynamic databases.  In order to have tunnel to tunnel and database to database comparisons, similar facilities need to be utilized.  This eliminates some of the uncertainty in the aerodynamic database, thus reducing risk to the program. The authority for this action is the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), and 10 USC 2304(c)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 23, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Stennis Space Center Acquisition Management Office intends to issue a sole source, firm fixed price contract to GeoEye, Incorporated, St. Louis, MO 63146, for a large volume of space-based multispectral imagery of the Earth from the SEAWiFs instrument on board the OrbView-2 Spacecraft.  The contract will have a base period of one year with options for four additional years.  The principal objective is to acquire data that is critical for the study of the role of the oceans in the earth’s biogeochemical process, especially the effect of the temporal and spatial variability in phytoplankton and their impact on the global carbon cycle.  The data required must be space-based, global in scope and provide full coverage of the earth every two days (excluding cloud cover and low sun elevations).  The instrument that collects the data must be well characterized and sufficiently well calibrated so as to provide for a long-term, stable record of the earth’s bio-optical properties.  The sensor used should have a sufficient heritage in the provision of data to the earth science community, including the public availability of data and a strong record of publication in peer-reviewed literature.  This heritage may have been generated on the instrument for which the data are being offered or from another instrument for which there is a sufficient degree of commonality with the current instrument so as to provide a seamless transition in the derived measurements.  This is a Commercial Item Acquisition under FAR Part 12.  The remote sensing data acquired in this procurement will be used by the NASA Applied Science community to conduct on-going science research.  This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes only one responsible source can provide the service that will satisfy the agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on March 28, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Proposals (RFP OAM-2002-N-007).  This combined synopsis/solicitation is organized in eight parts: (1)Background and Specific Requirements; (2) Cost Proposals; (3) Format and Instructions for Technical Proposal, (4) Technical Evaluation Criteria; (5) Applicability of Federal Acquisition Regulation Provisions,  (6) Technical Questions and Bidders' Library, (7) Point of Contact and (8) Submission of Offers.  1. BACKGROUND AND REQUIREMENTS:  The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) has a need for delivery of Retirement (Mid-Career) Seminars and Retirement Planning Seminars.  The Compensation and Benefits Group, a component of GAO's Human Capital Office, is responsible for providing retirement services to GAO employees.  Many federal agencies, including GAO, have offered pre-retirement planning seminars as one of those services.  Typically, the mid-career retirement seminars are made available to employees who are within 10-15 years of retirement eligibility and the Retirement Planning Seminars are made available to employees who are within 5 years of retirement eligibility.  Both seminars last for several days, and provide in-depth information to assist the employees in making critical decisions as they approach and prepare for retirement. The Compensation and Benefits Group does not possess the necessary subject matter knowledge to conduct pre-retirement seminars of the scope desired, nor is such expertise available elsewhere in GAO.  In addition, by addressing groups rather than single employees, the seminars represent a cost-effective way of conveying need of information. (A) Scope of work: The contractor will provide an off-the-shelf seminar meeting GAO's requirements.  The Mid-Career seminar session will be delivered two (2) days in length.  60 participants normally will attend each session.  It is estimated that the Mid-Career seminar will be delivered at least three (3) times each fiscal year (FY) from FY 2003 through FY 2007.   The Retirement Planning seminar session will be delivered three (3) days in length.  30 participants normally will attend each session.  However, there may be a need to enroll up to five (5) additional participants. It is estimated that the Retirement Planning seminar will be delivered at least (4) four times each fiscal year (FY)from FY 2003 through FY 2007.  The contractor will also be required to perform a walk-through of each seminar.  The walk-through is intended to be an oral presentation to be made by one or more of the contractor's representatives.  It must describe the contents of each seminar and the teaching methodologies intended to be used for each seminar component.  This will give GAO representatives the opportunity to ask questions and seek additional information, as they deem necessary.  The estimated time for the walk-through is 2 to 8 hours for each seminar, the actual time can not be determined since GAO is unable to determine how much detail that the contractor will be providing and the extent of questions GAO representatives will raise.  The contractor may be required to perform a second walk-through (depending on the extent of changes resulting from the initial walk-through) at no additional charge to GAO.  (B) Course Contents: The objectives of the seminars are to provide employees with an array of information to increase the participants' level of understanding and awareness of policies and procedures.  Also the training will enable them to better plan and make better decisions about retirement. The contractor will use teaching techniques appropriate to the subject matter and the audience.  Each seminar will cover at a minimum the following subjects:  Mid-Career: Federal Retirement System (FERS and CSRS); Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) program and Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program as they affect retirement; Thrift Savings Plan (TSP); Social Security Benefits; and Financial planning.   Retirement Planning: Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS); Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) program and (Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program as they affect retirement Thrift Savings Plan (TSP); Annuities and survivors' benefits; Social Security, as it relates to federal retirees, and Medicare; Financial planning; Estate planning; Legal issues related to retirement, including wills; Life after retirement; and Health and fitness in retirement.  (C) Course Materials: The contractor will prepare seminar binders containing written materials for each of the subjects to be covered and provide GAO with a binder for each participant.  GAO will provide the contractor with a list of retirement-related publications that it makes available to its staff so that the contractor can avoid unnecessary expenses in providing materials already available to seminar participants. The contractor will be responsible for providing any audio or visual materials to be used in delivering the seminars.   GAO will provide an overhead projector, projection screen, and flipcharts.  If the contractor intends to use other equipment, the type of equipment should be identified in its proposal.  GAO will provide it if it already possesses it but otherwise it will be the contractor's responsibility to provide it.  (D) Deliverables: (1) within 20 working days after the effective date of the contract, the contractor will conduct an initial walk-through of the Retirement Mid-Career and Retirement Planning Seminars.  All course materials, (including but not limited to the instructor's guide, participant manual, overhead transparencies, handouts, other visual material, and audio material) to be used must be provided at that time; (2) Within 20 working days after the initial walk-through, the contractor will make revisions to both seminars contents as agreed upon with the COTR.  If requested by the COTR, the contractor will conduct a second walk-through at no additional cost to GAO; (3) On agreed-upon dates, the contractor will conduct sessions for the retirement planning and mid-career seminars, using qualified instructors.  GAO will provide classroom space for the seminar sessions; and (4) no later than the working day before each seminar session, the contractor will provide GAO with a binder for each participant.  (E) Training Location: All seminar sessions will be held in the GAO Headquarters Building (441 G Street, NW, Washington, D.C.) or in other designated space in the downtown Washington, DC area provided by GAO.  (F) Schedule of Classes - Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year of the contract, the GAO COTR will inform the contractor how many seminar sessions for each of the Retirement (Mid-Career) and Retirement Planning sessions that it anticipates conducting during the year.  In addition, the COTR will indicate if GAO has preferences as to session dates.  Although the contractor will, to the extent feasible, provide sessions on the dates requested, the dates for each session will be arrived at by mutual agreement between the contractor and the COTR. During the course of a fiscal year, GAO may request additional seminar sessions.  Subject to mutual agreement between the contractor and the COTR on session dates, such sessions will be added at the contract price in effect at the time of the request. Each class day (including lunch and break time) will be 7 to 8 hours, beginning no earlier than 8 a.m. and ending no later than 4:30 p.m.  There will be a one-hour lunch break between 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. and at least one 15-minute break in each the morning and afternoon (H) Evaluation of Course - GAO will evaluate the course using participant questionnaires developed by GAO, and provide the results of the evaluations to the contractor.  If the contractor wants to use its own evaluation form (which should be included in its technical proposal), GAO will distribute it to seminar participants.  However, it will augment--not replace--GAO's form. 2. COST PROPOSALS:  Offerors are required to request via email (Dannerp@GAO.gov) or fax (202) 512-3999 a copy of the pricing schedule. Failure to complete and submit the pricing may exclude your offer from consideration. The Pricing Schedule will identify fixed rates over the five-year contract period. An original and four (4) copies as a separately from the technical proposal are to be submitted. 3.  FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSALS:  The proposal must be signed by an official authorized to bind the offeror.  Proposals must contain: (a) the name, address and telephone number of the offeror, (b) cost proposal (c) Representations and Certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (d) technical proposal (original and four copies) addressing the management and approach of how GAO's requirements will be satisfied,  (e) course agenda including amount of time to be allotted for each and the teaching techniques to be used (f) resumes of  the instructors, (g) a participant binder containing written materials for each of the subjects to be covered and (h) identification of at least 3 government references . Technical proposals should not exceed 25 pages. Pages beyond 25 will not be considered. Offerors that fail to furnish required representation and certifications or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from further consideration.  4. TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA: FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - - Commercial Items.  This a best value procurement.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. Also, the government reserves the right to make an award on the basis of initial proposal, without holding discussions.  Therefore, the offeror initial proposal should contain their best terms from a technical and cost standpoint. The following elements are to be included in your technical proposal. The following factors will be used to evaluate offers and should be addressed in your technical proposal:   (a) Technical Approach and Management (20 points):  The offeror must submit a description of the services it will provide that demonstrates it clearly understands the Statement of Work and all required details of the RFP.  The offeror also must submit a management plan, indicating how it will assure that the contract work is properly and timely performed.

(b) Seminar Materials (15 points):  The offeror must submit a course agenda, indicating all major topics to be covered, the order in which they are to be covered, the amount of time to be allotted to each, and the teaching techniques to be used (e.g., lecture, discussion, audio-visual presentations).  The offeror also must submit a participant binder containing written materials for each of the subjects to be covered in the seminar.  (c) Corporate Experience and Past Performance (including references), (35 points):  The offeror must demonstrate that it has substantial experience in presenting pre-retirement planning seminars or in performing similar work, and that it has performed such work satisfactorily within the last three (3) years.  To do so, the offeror must submit names of all federal government agencies for which it has presented pre-retirement seminars or performed similar work.  The offeror also may submit names of non-federal entities for which it has performed such work.  For each named federal government agency and non-federal entity for which the offeror has, within the past three (3) years, presented pre-retirement seminars or performed similar work, the offeror must include the name, address, and phone number of a contact person who works for the agency or entity and, if relevant, contract numbers.  GAO reserves the right to contact any of the named agencies and entities.  If the offeror intends to subcontract any of the work (except through personal service contracts with individual instructors), it must provide, for each subcontractor, the information requested in the previous two paragraphs as well as copies of any subcontract agreements already in effect.  In evaluating past performance, GAO will consider information obtained from past and present customers.

<DESC>Algorithms are sought for fused, and or, coherent cross-platform Radio Frequency (RF) sensing.  The focus of this effort is to improve surveillance utilizing a network, not fusion of disparate sensor products.  The algorithms should be capable of utilizing RF returns from multiple aspects in a time-coordinated sensor network.  These algorithms should enhance detection, tracking, and identification while minimizing sensor and network resource utilization and minimizing the ability of the enemy to exploit and deny sensors.  The network of heterogeneous sensors can use both common and disparate frequencies.  Sensors may arbitrarily enter and leave the network.  It can be assumed that the sensor platform will have access to Global Positioning Service (GPS) and Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) timing and navigation data.

<SUBJECT>R--Implementation of the Public Water Systems Supervision (PWSS) And Underground Injection Control (UIC) Programs.
<SOLNBR>PR-CI-07-10359
<CONTACT>WILLIAM M. YATES, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2055, E-Mail: yates.william@epa.gov
<DESC>Implementation of the Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) and Underground Injection Control (UIC) Programs (PR-CI-07-10359) The Environmental Protection Agency?s Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW) requires a contactor to provide technical support for services that will support EPA?s implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).  The SDWA envisions a joint federal/state partnership to protect public health through safe drinking water.   The Act as amended in 1996 further envisions a multiple barrier approach to public health protection including protection of source waters from contamination; treatment at the water plant and management of the distribution system to ensure compliance with nationally-promulgated standards; and efforts to inform customers of public water systems about local drinking water quality.  Since 2001, EPA?s responsibilities have been extended to address the security of the nation?s critical water and wastewater infrastructure from terrorist and other intentional acts, in accordance with the Public Health and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Bioterrorism Act) and Homeland Security Presidential Directives. The SDWA requires EPA to evaluate unregulated contaminants as well as to periodically review existing regulations.  EPA oversees implementation of the Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) and Underground Injection Control (UIC) programs by states and tribes with primary enforcement authority and directly implements these programs in the absence of state or tribal enforcement authority.   In addition to assisting states and water systems in meeting regulatory requirements, EPA carries out an array of related activities including promotion of source water protection; oversight of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF); characterization of public water system needs; data management and verification audits; development of tools and analyses to support program accountability; analytical methods development;  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) modeling promotion of  approaches for sustainable infrastructure; support for consumer confidence and public notice requirements; support for sanitary surveys; and development of products such as guidance, training and tools to strengthen small water systems? capacity development efforts and support the use of certified operators.  EPA may promulgate regulations under the UIC program and is also engaged in addressing emerging underground injection issues such as carbon sequestration and disposal of drinking water treatment residuals. The contractor will provide technical, analytical, logistical, administrative, engineering and statistical support to the Agency?s efforts to develop and implement regulations, guidance and policies across this full range of SDWA implementation activities. This includes activities such as collecting data, information and materials and providing factual studies, trend analyses and recommendations; conducting modeling and assessments to support risk characterization and impact analyses development and survey support and facilitation.  The contractor shall provide such support in accordance with specific written work assignments or request for proposals for task orders related to the Agency?s development of drinking water, ground water, and UIC regulations, future regulatory and programmatic decisions, and implementation of its policies and programs under the SDWA.  Responsible offerors shall demonstrate an ability to provide the level of effort, material, equipment, and facilities necessary to provide timely, professional engineering, technical and administrative services necessary to investigate chemical, radiological and microbiological contaminant occurrences to characterize drinking water threats. The resulting contract will include management of multiple, concurrent work assignments which will require long-term as well as quick turn-around responses essential to the statutory responsibilities of the Office of Water as well as some task orders. The proposed contract type will be a cost-plus-fixed-fee hybrid Performance  Based Service Acquisition (PBSA) level-of-effort and task order, contract consisting of a base period performance of twelve months, followed by three (3) optional performance periods of 12 months each and (3) award term options for a total potential performance period of seven (7) years. The base period will consist of a maximum amount of 65,100 professional direct labor hours, with 43,400 base direct professional labor hours plus 21,700 optional quantity direct labor professional hours. Option period one will consist of a maximum amount of 65,100 professional direct labor hours, with 43,400 base direct professional labor hours plus 21,700 optional quantity direct labor professional hours.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award  a contract for Glass and Quartz Filters with Whatman Incorporated , 9 Bridewell Place Clifton NJ 07014 on a sole source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) which implements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)- " Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."   The EPA awarded Contract EP-D-05-014 to Whatman, Inc. in 2005.  This contract contained a Base plus four option periods with an expiration date of 12/31/2009.  This contract prematurely expired before all optons were exercised.  However, the EPA continues to have an immediate requirement for Glass and Quartz Filters.   This sole source  contract will require the delivery of two unique types of high purity particulate air filters (22,000 each Glass filters and 76,000 each  Quartz filters).  The Quartz filters are used with a size selective sampler to collect PM-10(particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) samples.   The glass fiber filters are used with a Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) sampler. The filters shall be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution to various Federal, state and local agencies.  It is imperative that all filters of the same type from  the same delivery contain a uniform level of impurities.  Therefore, the contractor shall manufacture all filters for a delivery from the same sheet material using a single production line and one production run. This process  assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks. Filters are required to undergo a 90 day acceptance testing period following production and prior to fielding.  Additionally, any vendor other than Whatman would be required to submit samples of both Glass and Quartz Filters that are required to undergo and pass detailed inspection tests by the Agency prior to production.  These tests take from 30 to 45 days to complete.  All Filters are required to be ready for fielding no later than December 1, 2007.   Only Whatman, Inc. can supply the needed filters within the time frame the EPA requires.  Interested parties who believe that they are qualified to perform this effort within the time frames required by the EPA must submit a written statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to:  Robert Flowers, RTP Procurement Operations Division, Mail Drop E105-02, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 for consideration by the Agency. Capability statements should demonstrate a detailed plan for providing 50 Glass and 50 Quartz Filters for pre-production testing by the EPA and subsequent delivery of the required quantities of both types of filters by the end of August 2007.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The determination to compete the contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within  the discretion of the Government.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any sourc(s) exist, therefore, no formal solicitation (RFP) is available at this time.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This contract is for excavation, data recovery, and documentation of one archeological site on Ross Lake during reservoir drawdown, approximately late April through early June, 2007.  The contractor shall employ standard methods for surface mapping of artifacts, site mapping, excavation of shovel or test probes, excavation of stratigraphy trenches and pits, and full-scale excavation using 1x1 and 2x2 m square excavation units, as needed to perform data recovery.   The contractor shall employ standard laboratory and analytic techniques to describe, identify, and classify archeological collections, as well as prepare an inventory of all artifacts recovered from excavation units, to include their provenience, class or artifact category, age assessment, and context (in situ or disturbed).  The contractor shall prepare a report describing laboratory methods, field methods, and their results, along with archeological interpretations of the data that address issues and objectives of the research design.  The site's annual exposure to reservoir shoreline erosion processes may have altered site conditions since original field testing in 1989-1990.  No pre-contact period human burials, gravesites, ceremonial features, or sacred objects have been recorded or reported at the project area or within the park boundaries.  The historic gravesite of John McMillan is located far to the south of this project area. The contractor is strongly encouraged to seek qualified field workers among members of the three Skagit River tribes, to the extent possible.  At the contractor's request, NPS staff will provide contact information for each of the tribes, which include the Sauk-Suiattle, Swinomish, and Upper Skagit.   LOCATION:  The project area is located within the drawdown zone at the southern end of Ross Lake near Roland Point backcountry campsite, eastern Whatcom County, Washington, on lands managed by the National Park Service.  It is comprised of the exposed and devegetated reservoir bottom lands ("drawdown zone"), where reservoir sediments and eroded soils are exposed to air for a short time each year.  Directions to the site will be provided in the RFQ, but be advised there is no direct road or trail access to this site.  Information about Ross Lake may be found at http://www.nps.gov/archive/noca/rola/rosslake.htm SOLICITATION DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement open to small business concerns.  The NAICS code for this project is 541720 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million.  The electronic Request for Quotations will be available on approximately March 27, 2007, at www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov. In order to download the solicitation, interested vendors must register at  http://ideasec.nbc.gov and maintain an active registration at http://www.ccr.gov.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

<DESC>U.S. EPA Region I
Emergency & Rapid Response Services
RFP No: PR-XX-XX-XXXXX
Pre-Solicitation Notice/Special Notice

The intent of this notice is 1) to gather industry, especially small business (including 8(a), HUBZone, small disadvantaged business, service disabled veteran-owned small business and women-owned small business) input on EPA Region I’s follow-on Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) requirements for New England, and 2) to announce an ERRS forum which will be held to provide the business community the opportunity to learn more about this opportunity.  The current Region I ERRS contract (68-W-03-037) will expire on July 31, 2008.

EPA Region I consists of the New England states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont as well as the tribal nations located within New England).  The overall requirement will be to provide cleanup services for emergency and time critical removal actions, which include the release or threat of release of oil, petroleum products, hazardous substances, or pollutants and contaminants that pose an actual or potential threat to human health or welfare, or to the environment.  Environmental cleanup/ response to natural and man made disasters, terrorist activities, weapons of mass destruction, and nuclear, biological or chemical incidents may also be required under this contract.  Contractors should read the attached Draft Region I Performance Work Statement (PWS) for Emergency and Rapid Response Services for details of the tasks the Government anticipates having performed under the follow-on contract(s), including response times.  Please note that while there is a detailed Level A response capability specified in the draft PWS, the government is still evaluating whether it needs to include that quantity of response in the resultant contract(s).  Regardless, some Level A capability will be required.  Also, please note that the resultant contract(s) will include provisions requiring the contractor(s), under certain circumstances, to respond outside of New England (through regional cross-over and trans-boundary (outside of the US) responses).  


Contractors must be technically qualified to undertake response actions relative to section 104 of the “Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980” (CERCLA) as amended by “Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986” (SARA) and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, Subtitle I of the “Resource Conservation and Recovery Act” (RCRA) as amended by SARA of 1986, and the “Clean Water Act” as amended by the “Oil Pollution Act of 1990.”  Contractor(s) may also be tasked to support EPA’s role under the National Response Plan (NRP) in instances of presidential-declared disasters pursuant to the “Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act” (Stafford Act).  To meet these requirements Contractors must also be able to respond to an incident and adopt the tenets of the Incident Command System (ICS) in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive – 5, National Incident Management System (NIMS).

The Government may award multiple contracts for this requirement.  Various alternative contracting approaches are currently under review.   Potential offerors are advised that if they are a current Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team (START) contractor or a START subcontractor or consultant in Region I, they will be ineligible for award of this contract IAW the terms of their contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Justice is developing an acquisition strategy for its requirement for professional investigative, analytical and technical support services to the DOJ Asset Forfeiture Program (AFP).  To clarify, this component of the AFP is for professional advisory services and NOT for ongoing, repetitive administrative support services.  As part of this process we are seeking information about small businesses that are capable of performing the work.  Please note that this is a market survey for informational purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  There is no solicitation document available at this time; no contract will be awarded based on this announcement; no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement; and no telephone calls about this announcement will be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses must be submitted via e-mail in accordance with the instructions that follow.

The nature of the work required, especially that which is case-related, is frequently such that services must be performed within stringent time constraints.  Since the AFP operates nation-wide, projects may take place anywhere within the United States.  The following are examples of the types of services that may be ordered under this contract: Program Evaluation, Management and Organizational Analyses, Financial Management and Internal Controls Analyses, Information Resources Management, Commercial Accounting and Business Analysis, Enterprise Management, Training, Consultant Services, Civil Investigative Services.  By far the largest bulk of work performed under the existing contracts falls under the category of Civil Investigative Services; there are currently approximately 180 full-time and 40 part-time contractor personnel providing investigative and other support services to the  DOJ AFP community.  Interested parties must be able to provide support services in all of the categories listed.  Because of the nature of the work performed, Secret and Top Secret clearances are required of the majority of contractor personnel and companies must have Top Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission.  

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611, with a small business size standard of $6.5 million.  Responses to this announcement must provide detailed, concise information about the company’s qualifications and experience in support services similar to those described herein, within the past five (5) years.  Responses shall include a list of up to five (5) such projects.  Project information shall include the contract number, dollar value, period of performance, current status, and current point of contact information including name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.  Previous experience with obtaining Secret and Top Secret clearances for contractor personnel is important.

In addition, the response must state small business size status (small; 8(a); small disadvantaged; HUBZone; service disabled, veteran owned; etc.) and not exceed 10 pages.  All responses must be submitted electronically to Linh.lam@usdoj.gov and be received no later than March 26, 2007.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

They posses proprietary hardware and software and are the only source that can provide the subject modifications without a substantial duplication of costs and schedule delays.

<DESC>Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT) Request for Information (RFI)
	
This is a request for information and not a solicitation.


INTRODUCTION:
An RFI and associated Industry Day was held in April 2006 to obtain information concerning a Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT).  Continued technical analysis has been used to generate a DRAFT Test Capability Requirements Document (TCRD).  A review of this document for comment by industry is scheduled for 31 January 2007 in Colorado Springs, CO and interested parties are invited to attend.

The STAT will be a testbed facility that will be used to test space system survivability against natural, environmental, and man-made effects.  STAT will provide connectivity to a satellite control center (SOC) for systems under test in order to train space operators to recognize threats and aid in the development of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to mitigate the effects of those threats.  STAT is envisioned to include space chambers with realistic natural space environmental conditions, as well as integrated representative threat sources.   STAT Spiral 1 will develop the technology to integrate and control the various environmental sources and build a capability to test sub-system size components and microsats.  

PLEASE INDICATE YOUR INTEREST TO ATTEND 
TO THE POINT OF CONTACT BELOW BY 
24 January 2007 

CONTACT INFORMATION:
PCO: AEDC/PK

           Sue.tate@arnold.af.mil

Note: The information received will not obligate the Government in any manner nor will the Government reimburse contractors for any costs associated with this submittal of the request for information.  This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or a Request for Proposal, nor should it be considered as a commitment on the part of the Government.


1.  SCOPE.
This request for information is directed to potential prime contractors who have demonstrated experience in the design, development, and integration of new satellite test capabilities.  The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine potential acquisition strategies for the STAT.  Further, this information will help the Government structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks.

2.   OBJECTIVES.  
The main objectives in this project are as follows:
1. Design the STAT Spiral 1 facility.
2. Develop integrated environmental source and infrastructure control systems. 
3. Procure all necessary hardware that is not provided GFE.
4. Integrate the environmental sources, chamber subsystems, controls and Satellite Operation Center Links into a functional test capability.

3.  REQUIREMENTS.
The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall have real time capability for emulating the natural and man-made space environment at various orbital conditions.  It shall also incorporate three operationally realistic man-made threat sources, and the ability to connect the System Under Test (SUT) to a satellite operations center (SOC).  The following are operational and system specifications or limitations applicable to the design and development of this System:

3.1	Operational:  The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall emulate a complex natural and man-made space environment, to include realistic flux levels and/or fluences of the atomic oxygen, low energy protons, electrons, UV, contamination, and spacecraft charging.  It will also include three operationally relevant threat sources, and the ability to connect the payload to the Satellite Operations Center.
  
3.1.1	The system shall emulate the appropriate conditions for orbits ranging from Low Earth Orbit to Geosynchronous and Sun-Synchronous orbits.
  
3.1.2	The System shall have the capability to operate the threat sources and the environmental source in a controlled manner to simulate realistic combined environmental conditions experienced by operational systems.

3.1.3	The system shall allow the connection of the System Under Test (SUT) to be connected to a remote Satellite Operations Center at the Center for Research Support (CERES) at Falcon AFB, Colorado, and shall monitor the data streams being fed over the control networks to ensure they meet all applicable standards and regulations.

3.1.4	The system shall allow real-time control of all sources to allow scripting of environmental and/or induced anomaly situations to be simulated.

3.2	Chamber Infrastructure:  An 8ft by 24ft vacuum chamber located at Arnold Engineering Development Center will be made available as GFE for this effort.  Integration of vacuum pumping and cryogenic systems, as well as an integrated control system shall be accomplished by the contractor.  Electrical Power (up to 440V 3-phase), water, compressed air and dry Nitrogen are all available through the existing building infrastructure.

3.3	Natural Environment Sources:

3.3.1	The system shall include atomic oxygen generation capabilities capable of simulating energy levels and fluxes representative of the levels experienced in Low Earth Orbits.  

3.3.2	The system shall include low energy proton acceleration capabilities capable of simulating fluences seen at solar max.

3.3.3	The system shall include UV lamps capable of simulating the solar spectra at 2 times solar intensity.

3.3.4	The system shall include electron acceleration capabilities capable of simulating trapped electrons.
 
3.4	Spacecraft Self-induced Condition Simulation:

3.4.1	The system shall include the capability to introduce controlled levels of contamination to simulate the outgassing and redeposition of other satellite materials on the System Under Test.

3.4.2	The system shall include ion acceleration sources capable of simulating electric propulsion back-flux of low-energy Xenon ions.

3.4.3	The system shall include the capability to introduce an electric potential on the surface of the System Under Test to simulate the effects of spacecraft self-charging.

3.5	Threat Sources:  The system shall include three operationally relevant threat sources capable of simulating the effects of those threats on the satellite.

3.6	Connectivity to Satellite Operations Center:  The System shall allow the payload to be connected to the Satellite Operations Center in the Center for Research Support (CERES) at Schriever AFB, CO.  This will allow integrated operational test and evaluation, crew training, anomaly resolution utilizing actual hardware, the development of tactics, techniques and procedures, and assessment of system level vulnerabilities to natural and induced environments.  Due to the possibility of early utilization of the CCOSE chamber (see below) in Tactics, Techniques and Procedures development, connectivity must be achieved within the first 3 months of the program.

3.7	Existing Prototype:  The existing CCOSE chamber, located at AEDC was developed under the Test Technology Development and Demonstration program, and represents a subscale prototype and risk reduction effort.  This facility, and the technologies incorporated into it will be made available to the contractor to use in the development of the STAT facility.

<DESC>Modification description: Please send responses to Mona.Neal@gsa.gov instead of April.OConnor@gsa.gov by COB March 23, 2007. <p>
*************************************************<p>
The General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Service (GSA-FAS), on behalf of the Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP), is issuing this notice to inform industry that an initial Request For Quotation (Phase I), for the Technology Insertion FY08 (TI-08) will be issued on or about April 20, 2007.  Issuance of a final RFQ (Phase II) is anticipated on or about September 24, 2007.  Phase I of the RFQ will be issued primarily to determine general pricing, performance (via a set of DoD Benchmarks) and related HPC functional capabilities for HPC systems that are deliverable on or before July 2008.  Phase II of the RFQ will request offerors to provided detailed pricing, configuration, performance (via a set of DoD Benchmarks), maintenance, and delivery information for one or more specific HPC system configurations to significantly improve the DoDs HPC capability and capacity.  The application benchmark codes that are anticipated to be included in the TI-08 application benchmark suite are recognized by the following names: CTH, HYCOM, GAMESS, AVUS and OOCORE.  Benchmarks that can optionally be executed and submitted as supplemental information to Government predicted performance estimates include ICEPIC, LAMMPS, Overflow-2, WRF and AMR.  See a related FedBizOpps announcement for an invitation to a March 1, 2007 information-exchange workshop to discuss the methods the Government intends to use for Government predicted benchmark performance.  <p>

Responses to the RFQ will only be considered from original equipment manufacturers who:  (1) have offerings obtainable via existing GSA Contracts under Schedule 70 General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, Services; (2)  have demonstrated the sustainment of a commercially available HPC systems product line with success in large scale manufacturing, deployment and maintenance of commercially available, production HPC systems; and (3) have clearances allowing access to sensitive DoD technology and facilities.  Furthermore, the Government financial appropriations associated with this acquisition do not permit the purchase of any supercomputer which is not manufactured in the United States.  Interested vendors are required to submit a NTE 10 page paper providing evidence of their ability to meet the above requirements to Ms. April OConnor at april.oconnor@gsa.gov by COB March 23, 2007.  In cases where the vendor is acquiring substantial portions of a potentially offered system from third party suppliers, please be specific in justifying your role as an OEM with a sustainable HPC product line versus, for example; a reseller, an assembler or an integrator of HPC systems.  An evaluation of the information submitted will be conducted and letters of eligibility will be distributed to qualified vendors by April 13, 2007.  An information briefing will be offered to pre-qualified vendors.  The briefing is currently scheduled for the morning of May 3, 2007 beginning at 9:00AM EDT and will be followed by vendor-specific, one-on-one information exchange meetings and question and answer sessions individually scheduled for the afternoon of May 3 and, as needed, on May 4 to host all qualified vendors.  Each vendor will be allowed 30 minutes for their May 3 or May 4 one-on-one session.   For more details about the HPCM Program visit the website at www.hpcmo.hpc.mil. Questions can be submitted to GSA at any time during the RFQ process.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP printers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the HP 1200d Printer as a key component to produce emergency photo-digitized passports at overseas Posts.  The HP1200d was selected for this purpose because results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. in tests of commercial, non-custom ink jet printers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s requirements.   The 1200d uses some color in producing a grayscale printout.  Other manufacturers’ printers solely use black ink for this printing option.  The introduction of color in the generation of grayscale images significantly improves their quality and enhances overall document security since illicit duplication and image substitution is more difficult.  In addition, other manufacturers were found to use an ink formula that appeared to degrade output resolution and print quality, thereby lessening the security of these travel documents.  Lastly, a key issue in choosing the HP1200d was its proven ability to reliably feed the special stock used in the generation of emergency passport books.  Other printers experienced a higher rate of paper jams and stock spoilage because they were unable to handle paper of the weight and substrate finish used by the DoS. It should be noted that the only other printer that was judged to meet the Department’s specifications was the Ricoh G700, which cannot be procured or fielded because it is not BAA/TAA compliant.  In summation, the continued use of the HP 1200d printer, rather than the introduction of another manufacturer’s product at this stage in the program’s life cycle, is deemed to be the most cost effective course of action.  No other BAA/TAA compliant printer fully meets the Department’s requirements.  The continued use of one make and model printer, the 1200D, eliminates the need to purchase, maintain and account for inventories of spare parts, cables, cleaning kits, ink cartridges and other accessories for multiple printer types.  Moreover, the selection of the 1200d obviates the need to train end users in the use and maintenance of multiple printers As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The HP 1200D Printer has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board<BR><BR>

<DESC>Market Survey/Sources Sought – Patient Safety Organization Privacy Protection Center

In response to the 2005 Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is conducting a market survey to seek potential small business sources (including 8(a), small disadvantaged, HUBZone, veteran-owned small business and service disabled veteran-owned small business) to evaluate the establishment of a Patient Safety Organization Privacy Protection Center to conduct technical assistance and patient safety event data de-identification services for certified Patient Safety Organizations.

AHRQ is seeking potential sources from qualified small business firms under NAICS Code 541990 (size standard - $6.5 million) which can demonstrate the capability to create, operate, maintain, and enhance a Patient Safety Organization Privacy Protection Center.  

The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act established a framework through which hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers can work to improve health care quality in a protected legal environment.  The act extends legal privilege and confidentiality to health care providers voluntarily reporting patient safety events and “close calls” to patient safety organizations (PSO) which will be certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  In turn, PSOs collect and analyze patient safety data to develop and help providers implement patient safety improvement strategies in a protected legal environment. Additionally, the act authorizes the Secretary to “facilitate the creation of and maintain a network of patient safety databases that provides an interactive evidence-based management resource.”  This network shall “accept, aggregate across the network, and analyze non-identifiable patient safety work product voluntarily reported by patient safety organizations.”  The Act also allows the Secretary to specify common formats for the reporting of patient safety information to the network and to provide technical assistance to PSOs.

To facilitate the efficient and effective operation of PSOs and minimize the reporting burden of PSOs contributing data to the Network of Patient Safety Databases, AHRQ proposes to create and support a PSO Privacy Protection Center.  This center will offer technical assistance to PSOs, receive patient safety event information from PSOs, and render this information non-identifiable. The PSO Privacy Protection Center will then transfer de-identified information to the Network of Patient Safety Databases.  

The anticipated relationships between the PSOs, the PSO Privacy Protection Center, the Network of Patient Safety Databases, AHRQ and other potential users of information from the Network are illustrated in Figure 1. 
 
This market survey is for the PSO Privacy Protection Center.  A separate market survey will be issued for the Network of Patient Safety Databases.  

Specific work in this project will include establishing the PSO Privacy Protection Center, receiving information on patient safety events from PSOs who participate, rendering this information non-identifiable, transferring non-identifiable information of patient safety events to the Network of Patient Safety Database, and providing technical assistance to PSOs to support patient safety activities.  

Related tasks include convening experts as needed to guide PSO Privacy Protection Center activities and functions, and conducting an annual meeting of PSOs. 

Of utmost importance will be to protect the security and confidentiality of any patient safety event information.  The Contractor will be required to develop procedures and mechanisms that shall adhere to all Federal, DHHS and AHRQ IT security and confidentiality regulations.  Potential sources must demonstrate in their response to this market survey their knowledge and expertise with all applicable confidentiality and security procedures (including the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Health Service Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act and other applicable AHRQ and DHHS regulations).  The Contractor will need to retain at least one staff member who has a demonstrated understanding of the HIPAA and Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act privacy rules and confidentiality protections.  The Contractor will be required to develop a PSO Privacy Protection Center Security Plan and conduct regular security audits.

The Contractor will be required to use an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) in the management of this contract that is consistent with ANSI/EIA-STD-748 guidelines.  Potential sources must demonstrate in their response to this market survey their past experience with EVMS management.  

It is anticipated that the process of rendering patient safety information non-identifiable will entail considerable planning and work.  Information will need to be processed such that no individual patient, provider, or report can be identified.  This process will need to go beyond simple removal of unique patient, provider, and reporter identifiers and consider unique combinations of information that might inadvertently identify a patient, provider, or reporter.  Sources responding to this market survey must demonstrate in their response their expertise and experience in data de-identification.

The Contractor will be required to establish and maintain an expert panel to advise and provide feedback on the activities of the PSO Privacy Protection Center.  The panel will include both individuals with expertise in the delivery of technical assistance related to patient safety and individuals with expertise processing patient safety event information.  The Contractor will hold and provide support for the expert panel meetings.

Another important aspect to contribute to the success of this project depends on the willingness of PSOs to supply information/data on a voluntary basis.  A main function of the PSA Privacy Protection Center is to aid PSOs to minimize the burden on PSOs in supplying information to the PSO Privacy Protection Center and the recruitment of PSOs to supply data.  This will involve the development of a recruitment and incentive plan for PSOs.  The Contractor will create and maintain policies and procedures for partner PSO information resources and submission materials.  The Contractor will contact and actively recruit PSOs as partners and will execute partner agreements.  The Contractor will form PSO partner workgroups and manage and host a partner PSO listserv.  The Contractor will be a central resource to provide technical assistance to PSOs.   Potential sources must demonstrate their experience and expertise in this type of activity.

Potential respondents to this market survey should note that the separation of the functions of the Privacy Protection Center and of the Network is intentional; the Privacy Protection Center will work with information supplied directly by PSOs while the Network will only handle standardized information that has been rendered non-identifiable.  Hence, an organization can receive the contract for only one entity, the Privacy Protection Center or the Network, but not both.

Sources must demonstrate in their response to this market survey their expertise and experience and describe personnel with relevant education and demonstrated experience in areas such as:
•	Knowledge of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act and activities of PSOs
•	Knowledge of current patient safety tools, resources, organizational leaders and subject matter experts
•	Knowledge of legal policies and procedures related to use of protected health information (PHI- HIPAA, etc)
•	Skills in the development, implementation, and use of clinical data, especially patient safety reporting system data, to improve quality of care
•	Skills in processing and managing large clinical databases in a secure environment
•	Skills in managing and working with patient safety experts 
•	Ability to create knowledge based  tools to be used in the patient safety and health care quality environment
•	Ability to organize and conduct both large meetings and smaller topic specific workgroups and seminars
	
In addition, Sources must demonstrate expertise in developing and managing complex content-driven projects under tight timelines. 
A Project Management Institute (PMI)-certified or PMI-certification-eligible Project Manager is required as well as a demonstrated ability to provide Earned Value Management (EVM) information. 

Interested small businesses should submit their capability statements (no more than 10 pages in length) to:  Sharon Williams, Contracting Officer, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Division of Contracts Management, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville MD, 20850 
E-mail: Sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov 

Capability statements must be received no later than March 15, 2007, by 4:00 p.m.

Capability statements should address the specific requirements of this notice and identify the source's capabilities to complete this requirement, including, but not limited to information on key staff experience and education, and a description of corporate experience with similar projects. Capability statements should be submitted in an original and 2 copies or electronically. Electronic submissions should be submitted before noon to allow for processing.

<DESC>Market Survey/Sources Sought – Network of Patient Safety Databases

In response to the 2005 Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is conducting a market survey to seek potential small business sources (including 8(a), small disadvantaged, HUBZone, veteran-owned small business and service disabled veteran-owned small business) to establish and maintain a Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD) to fulfill the functions of such a network as specified in the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act.

AHRQ is seeking potential sources from qualified small business firms under NAICS Code  541990 (size standard - $6.5 million) which can demonstrate the capability to create, operate, maintain, and enhance a Network of Patient Safety Databases.  

The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (PSQIA) established a framework through which hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers can work to improve health care quality in a protected legal environment.  The act extends legal privilege and confidentiality to health care providers voluntarily reporting patient safety events that harmed or could have harmed (close calls) and analyses of these events to patient safety organizations (PSO).  PSOs that are listed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will aggregate and analyze patient safety data to assist providers implement patient safety improvement strategies in a protected legal environment. Additionally, the act authorizes the Secretary to “facilitate the creation of and maintain a network of patient safety databases that provides an interactive evidence-based management resource.”  This network shall “accept, aggregate across the network, and analyze non-identifiable patient safety work product voluntarily reported by patient safety organizations.”  The Act also allows the Secretary to specify common formats for the reporting of patient safety information to the network and to provide technical assistance to PSOs.

To facilitate a deeper level of analysis of patient safety events and to allow PSOs and providers access to an effective and robust resource for patient safety improvement, AHRQ proposes to create and support a Network of Patient Safety Databases.  The Network will receive non-identifiable patient safety event information from PSOs primarily through the PSO Privacy Protection Center.  It will have the capacity to receive non-identifiable, standardized patient safety information from PSOs not utilizing the PSO Privacy Protection Center and, potentially, from other entities. The Network will analyze the non-identifiable information received and create statistical reports useful to the patient safety community and to meet the reporting requirements of AHRQ. The Network will also serve as an interactive, evidence-based resource for PSOs and will work in close coordination with the PSO Privacy Protection Center in the distribution of analyses of patient safety information to the PSOs, providers, and other entities concerned with patient safety. The Network may be required to offer technical assistance to PSOs if requested by AHRQ and should be capable of providing such assistance.   

This market survey is for the Network of Patient Safety Databases.  A separate market survey will be issued for the PSO Privacy Protection Center.  

Potential respondents to this market survey should note that the separation of the functions of the Privacy Protection Center and of the Network is intentional; the Privacy Protection Center will work with information supplied directly by PSOs while the Network will only handle standardized information that has been rendered non-identifiable.  Hence, an organization can receive the contract for only one entity, the Privacy Protection Center or the Network, but not both.

Specific work in this project will include establishing the Network of Patient Safety Databases, receiving non-identifiable, standardized information on patient safety events from the PSO Privacy Protection Center (and other entities as practical and relevant), creating statistical reports and tools to reduce risk to patients and to improve the quality of care, distributing these reports and tools, and serving as an interactive, evidence-based resource for PSOs.  Potential related tasks include provision of technical assistance to PSOs. 

While only non-identifiable patient information should be received by the Network of Patient Safety Databases, an important aim remains to protect the security and confidentiality of all patient safety event information.  Therefore, the Contractor must develop procedures and mechanisms that adhere to all Federal, DHHS and AHRQ IT security and confidentiality regulations.  Potential sources must demonstrate in their response to this market survey their knowledge and expertise with all applicable confidentiality and security procedures (including the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Health Service Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act and other applicable AHRQ and DHHS regulations.  The Contractor will need to retain at least one staff member who has a demonstrated understanding of the HIPAA and Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act privacy rules and confidentiality protections.  The Contractor will be required to develop a PSO Privacy Protection Center Security Plan and conduct regular security audits.

The Contractor will be required to use an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) in the management of this contract that is consistent with ANSI/EIA-STD-748 guidelines.  Potential sources must demonstrate in their response to this market survey their past experience with EVMS management.  

The key work of the Network of Patient Safety Databases is to conduct analyses that support efforts to track and improve patient safety.  This work includes support of the National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports, analyses of trends and patterns of healthcare error at the national and regional levels and other analyses that support efforts to improve patient safety.

The PSQIA also charges the Network of Patient Safety Databases to provide an interactive, evidence-based management resource for providers, PSOs and other entities.  This resource may take the form of a web-based tool that allows users to search and browse the non-identifiable information submitted to the Network.  This resource must conform to Federal, DHHS and AHRQ requirements in laws, policies and directives for information technology, capital planning and investment, and Internet information management and the security of agency information and systems.  Potential offerors must demonstrate and describe their abilities and experience in developing and maintaining this type of resource in their response to this market survey.  

The Contractor will be required to provide general technical assistance to PSOs to include forming workgroups, establishing and maintaining a listserv, a central resource to provide advice to individual PSOs, the development of various types of products and tools to provide assistance to the PSOs, development of educational briefs (1-2 pages) each month, and the creation of tools or templates of use to PSOs.  Interested sources should include in their responses to this market survey a demonstrated ability to provide technical assistance of this type. 

Sources must demonstrate expertise and personnel with relevant education and demonstrated experience in areas such as:
•	Knowledge of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, activities of PSOs, and the function of the NPSD
•	Knowledge of legal policies and procedures related to use of protected health information (HIPAA, etc)
•	Knowledge of patient safety tools, resources, organizational leaders and subject matter experts 
•	Skills in processing and managing large clinical databases in a secure environment
•	Skills in the analysis and interpretation of aggregated clinical data, especially patient safety reporting system data, to reduce risks to patients and to improve the quality of care
•	Skills in managing and working with patient safety experts 
•	Ability to create knowledge-based reports to be used in the patient safety and health care quality environment
•	Ability to develop an interactive resource that allows PSOs and providers to access patient safety event information to improve patient safety
•	Expertise in developing and managing complex content-driven projects under tight timelines. 

A Project Management Institute (PMI)-certified or PMI-certification-eligible Project Manager is required as well as a demonstrated ability to provide Earned Value Management (EVM) information. 

Interested small businesses should submit their capability statements (no more than 10 pages in length) to:  Sharon Williams, Contracting Officer, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Division of Contracts Management, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville MD, 20850 
E-mail: Sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov 

Capability statements must be received no later than March 15, 2007, 4:00 p.m.

	Asset Management Services
The Department of the Treasury and its bureaus occupy space on almost 1,400 locations, operate a total of more than 4,000 motor vehicles, and are responsible for the proper care and stewardship of hundreds of thousands of personal property assets.  
These assets are used by Treasury bureaus for a number of purposes in accomplishing the Departmental missions.  They house Treasury personnel and provide them with the necessary tools and equipment to carry out their responsibilities whether they be regulatory compliance, law enforcement, development of financial and economic policy, or other purposes such as the manufacture and transportation of coin and currency.
Because of the nature of the functions these assets support, they are an essential part of each bureau operation and are, in many cases, mission critical tools.
The highly decentralized nature of the Treasury Department has resulted in each bureau acquiring and maintaining its own assets, establishing its own policies and procedures governing use and assignment of assets, and using disparate systems and levels of data collection for asset management.  Assets are acquired, maintained, and disposed of through multiple sources.
With the exception of some special purpose items, Treasury is interested in consolidating its asset management information in an integrated management information system in order to reduce administrative burden and maximize the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its operations.
This request for information seeks input on the various options for transitioning to an integrated asset management system that is operated and maintained in a shared services environment.  The system should support the Department?s inventory of real, personal, and fleet assets.  The integrated system does not need to be a single system, but must be capable of integrating the data reporting across the various asset classes.  In addition, the system must be capable of being integrated with the Department Financial Analysis and Reporting System for financial management reporting and analysis. 

 
 System Architecture
1	A Web based , Application Service Provider (ASP) solution
2	Support data input through multiple sources (key entry, uploads, hand-held readers, ftp, etc.)
3	XML agnostic to facilitate interfaces with other systems and databases
4	Provide scalablility to deal with changes in numbers of assets
5	Provide an audit trail record of who made what transactions/entries and when
System Functionality
6	Support an initial approximate size to be maintained in the system  of at least 50,000 assets
7	Permit replacement modeling based on user defined parameters and asset use
8	Facilitate maintenance forecasting and notification of required actions
9	Allow user defined maintenance requirements and frequencies
10	Allow generation of in-house or commercial work order tickets
11	Provide warranty management capability for assets and user-installed accessory equipment
12	Capture of multiple attributes for a given asset and the ability to sort by them
13	Calculation of depreciation, amortization, depletion and salvage or residual values on an item by item user-defined basis
14	Calculation of net book value of capitalized assets, sub-totaled by multiple categories
15	Calculation of depreciation, amortization, and depletion expense subtotaled by multiple categories
16	Provide a Dashboard functionality for monitoring of user-selected key fields

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY--FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.   This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) for Military Sealift Command (http://www.msc.navy.mil.)  MSC does not presently intend to award a contract, but seeks information on the existing capabilities on Maritime Satellite Communications (SATCOM) as a potential Next Generation Wideband (NGW) Initiative.
The Military Sealift Command is the sea transportation component of the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) and is the Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF) for the United States Navy.  The mission of MSC is to provide ocean transportation of equipment, fuel, supplies, and ammunition to sustain U.S. forces worldwide during peacetime and in war for as long as operational requirements dictate.  There are currently one hundred and ten (110) operational civilian mariners - crewed (CIVMAR) ships.  Seventy-two (72) of the vessels have their voice and data networks connected to the shore via the MSC Bandwidth Efficient Satellite Transport (BEST) Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure.  The MSC BEST satellite infrastructure provides the following features:

Centrally managed ship-specific uplink guaranteed bandwidth  allocation (non-shared, 256kbps maximum).

Ship-specific dynamic data rates set up in the return (uplink) direction through the Bandwidth Management Counsel (BMC) Server located at each Stratos Land Earth Station (LES) or through the Remote User Interface (RUI) Client located at each MSC Point-of-Presence (POP).

(Ship-specific uplink data rates are prepared in advance via transmission plans which are then applied as required.)

(Shared broadcast downlink.)

(Frame over satellite network architecture.)

(Utilizes leased International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT) L-Band generation II four (4) satellite constellation.)

(24x7 connectivity for all end user terminals at fixed cost.)

(Out-of-band management to BEST infrastructure devices.)

The primary objective of the Next Generation Wideband (NGW) initiative is to evaluate current and near-future maritime satellite technology for applicability as a replacement/upgrade for the existing MSC Afloat BEST satellite infrastructure.  The result of the evaluation will be an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) that will be the basis for the engineering and deployment of a new MSC SATCOM fleet solution.  The initiative is necessitated by BEST infrastructure end-of-lifecycle and capacity shortfall factors.  

The NGW initiative invites Maritime SATCOM solution providers to submit an information paper (not to exceed twenty-five (25) pages in length) detailing a NGW SATCOM system solution.  The submission shall include an overview (not to exceed five (5) pages) and a technical proposal.

<DESC>SERVICES SOURCES SOUGHT.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), Southeast Inspection Office, has a requirement to provide cross-utilization inspection services.  In accordance with CFR 260.1, the Secretary of Commerce is charged with the administration of regulations in this part except that he may delegate any or all of such functions to any officer or employee of the National Marine Fisheries Service of the Department in his discretion.  The NMFS is responsible for: (1) the development and advancement of commercial grade standards for fishery products and better health and sanitation standards in the industry; and (2) furnishing inspection and grading services and issuing certificates to producers, processors, shippers, receivers or interested parties.  In addition, CFR 260.49 Inspectors, states, “Inspections will ordinarily be performed by employees under the Secretary who are employed as federal Government employees for that purpose.  However, any person employed under any joint Federal-State inspection service arrangement may be licensed, if otherwise qualified, by the Secretary to make inspections in accordance with this part on such processed products as may be specified in his license.  Such license shall be issued only in a case where the Secretary is satisfied that the particular person is qualified to perform adequately the inspection service for which such person is to be licensed.”  The NMFS’ major purpose is to encourage and assist the industry in improving the quality and safety of its products, and to provide objective information by means of inspection and official certification concerning the class, quality, quantity, identity and condition of products which will be of maximum assistance to interested parties engaged in the production, processing, and marketing of fish and fishery products.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  The source is the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, P.O. Box 1951, Baton Rouge, LA.  The State of Louisiana through the Louisiana Department of Agriculture (LDAF) under the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 3, Section 412, is responsible for the inspection, grading and certification of fresh and saltwater fishery products in the State of Louisiana.  The LDAF is responsible for inspecting and grading fish and fishery products purchased by the State for use by State institutions and for inspecting and grading fish and fishery products purchased by and for local school systems.  The period of performance is for a base period from March 1, 2007 through February 28, 2008 with four (4) twelve (12)-month option periods.  The cooperative agreement between the USDOC, NMFS and the State of Louisiana includes a federal/state cross licensing agreement.  The work to be performed under this contract is an inherently federal function mandated by the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946.  50 CFR 260.49 limits performance of this type of work to either federal or state employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties should reference No. NFFKA520-7-00001PY and send their capability statement with evidence of licensing and ability to provide the required services stated above.  All proposals received within 30 days after the date of publication of this synopsis may be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government to restrict competition for this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.    Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The applicable NAICS code is 114119.  Firms having questions regarding the requirement and the authority cited under 50 CFR 260.49 may contact Ted Mackey at Edward.H.Mackey@noaa.gov or (816) 426-2068 Patsy Ybarra at Patsy.A.Ybarra@noaa.gov.

Cheryl A. Janus, RN, MBA at cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil
This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.
D. Evaluation Criteria
1.The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative. 
2.Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical criteria. The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for the purpose of evaluation of the technical criteria means the responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the vendor, who will be named the quoter, offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoter’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the product line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community in which such products and/or services are applicable; 3) the quoter has or is obtaining a DAPA for the product line, products and/or services; 4) the quoter has or is obtaining an agreement covering the product line, products and/or services with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region.  
After review of the technical criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. Vendors/offerors may be excluded from further consideration if they miss the deadline or receipt of samples.
The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Clinical factors will be weighted more heavily than price. All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors who fail to offer discounted prices could be excluded from RIA award consideration.
Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume agreement for a two-year period with (3) three possible one-year option periods (not to exceed a total of 5 years).
The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like format with a 1-7 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Slightly Disagree; 4 = Undecided; 5 = Slightly Agree; 6 = Agree; 7 = Strongly Agree). The CPT has set a threshold of 4.1 for acceptability of products for standardization. All clinical criteria are weighted equally. 
Clinical/performance results lower than 4.1 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 
The results of the clinical evaluation of the products are the most important factor to the TPRB when making a best value decision.  The TPRB considers pricing a secondary factor. 
1. Technical Criteria Evaluation
The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability:

<DESC>The Missoula Technology & Development Center is seeking information related to the specifications below for a Nursery Seeder.  The purpose of this Request for Information is to determine possible vendors in the market place.   Depending on the responses, a Request for Quote may be issued.  

The following equipment will be used to plant various forbs & grass seeds in previously cultivated nursery beds.


Nursery Forbs & Grass Seeder Specification

1)  The seeder shall be designed to attach to a 3-point category 1 or 2 tractor hitch.

2) Seeder shall have multiple, staggered rows capable of being configured to seed a combination of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 rows.

3) Row spacing should be variable & simple to adjust on a 68-72? wide toolbar.

4) The seed metering systems should be electronic and powered by a standard 12 volt DC battery.  The system should be capable of delivering seed from the size of a pea (10 seeds per gram) to very small seed such as yarrow (4500 seeds per gram). Ideally the seed should be modifiable to delivery seed as small as 10,000 seeds per gram.  

5) Seed metering systems should be able to distribute small volumes of seed and have removable hoppers (1-2Gallon) to allow easy removal and clan-up of unused seed.  Each hopper should be able to feed up to 6 seed tubes.

6) The seed metering systems should be capable of delivering raw, coated or pelleted seed without damaging it.  Calibration should be quick, easy, and accurate. 

7) The seed metering system should be capable of maintaining a constant seeding rate regardless of tractor speed which can vary from ? - 4 miles per hour.  Each hopper shall be controlled separately for optimal speed control and accuracy.  Ideally the control should be based off of GPS speed sensing.
 
8) Seeder components should be constructed of stainless steel and plastic to eliminate corrosion.

9) The seeder needs to be small, compact, and easy to ship from one location to another.

10) The seeder should ride on abrasive resistant plastic skids and not wheeled to eliminate mud build-up in wet conditions, which leads to inaccurate seeding depth.   The skids should help level the seed bed and cover seeded rows. 

11) Seeding depth should be easily adjustable by moving the toolbar and not each individual seed opener. 

12) Seed openers should be constructed of hardened stainless to resist wear.  They should be able to form a uniform channel so the seed is placed at an accurate depth.  The leading edge of the opener should be replaceable.

<SUBJECT>D -- DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, INTEGRATION, TESTING, IMPLEMENTATION, DEPLOYMENT, TRAINING, AND MAINTENANCE OF THE NEXT GENERATION IDENTIFICATION (NGI) - NOTICE TO INTERESTED PARTIES
<DESC>Over the past eighteen months, the NGI Program Office has provided Industry with information across a variety of forums.  The Request for Information (RFI) process yielded good input, resulting in the dissemination of a significant amount of additional information, as well as in improvements within the overall solicitation, currently out for Request for Comment (RFC).  The first Industry Day was well attended and provided an opportunity for vendors unfamiliar with CJIS to learn about the existing IAFIS and CJIS systems, the physical location, and to meet with CJIS managers.  Industry Day also provided vendors with opportunities for interaction with other interested companies.   

Rather than convening a 2nd Industry Day, the NGI Program Office has elected to continue to direct resources toward a high quality solicitation through focus on RFC comments and continued improvements to the procurement package.  The “Due Diligence” process will provide an opportunity for bidders to meet one-on-one with the NGI Program Office and subject matter experts, providing further clarification regarding the NGI Program and information needed to provide high quality, competitive proposals. 

The web-based Vendor library is available and populated with a broad range of documents, including over 140 engineering drawings.  The NGI Program Office will continue to work toward providing relevant, focused information to our Industry partners.

<SUBJECT>B -- Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT)
<DESC>1.  SCOPE.
This request for information is directed to potential prime contractors who have demonstrated experience in the design, development, and integration of new satellite test capabilities.  The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine potential acquisition strategies for the STAT.  Further, this information will help the Government structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks.

2.   OBJECTIVES.  
The main objectives in this project are as follows:
1. Design the STAT Spiral 1 facility.
2. Develop integrated environmental source and infrastructure control systems. 
3. Procure all necessary hardware that is not provided GFE.
4. Integrate the environmental sources, chamber subsystems, controls and Satellite Operation Center Links into a functional test capability.

3.  REQUIREMENTS.
The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall have real time capability for emulating the natural and man-made space environment at various orbital conditions.  It shall also incorporate three operationally realistic man-made threat sources, and the ability to connect the System Under Test (SUT) to a satellite operations center (SOC).  The following are operational and system specifications or limitations applicable to the design and development of this System:

3.1	Operational:  The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall emulate a complex natural and man-made space environment, to include realistic flux levels and/or fluences of the atomic oxygen, low energy protons, electrons, UV, contamination, and spacecraft charging.  It will also include three operationally relevant threat sources, and the ability to connect the payload to the Satellite Operations Center.
  
3.1.1	The system shall emulate the appropriate conditions for orbits ranging from Low Earth Orbit to Geosynchronous and Sun-Synchronous orbits.
  
3.1.2	The System shall have the capability to operate the threat sources and the environmental source in a controlled manner to simulate realistic combined environmental conditions experienced by operational systems.

3.1.3	The system shall allow the connection of the System Under Test (SUT) to be connected to a remote Satellite Operations Center at the Center for Research Support (CERES) at Falcon AFB, Colorado, and shall monitor the data streams being fed over the control networks to ensure they meet all applicable standards and regulations.

3.1.4	The system shall allow real-time control of all sources to allow scripting of environmental and/or induced anomaly situations to be simulated.

3.2	Chamber Infrastructure:  An 8ft by 24ft vacuum chamber located at Arnold Engineering Development Center will be made available as GFE for this effort.  Integration of vacuum pumping and cryogenic systems, as well as an integrated control system shall be accomplished by the contractor.  Electrical Power (up to 440V 3-phase), water, compressed air and dry Nitrogen are all available through the existing building infrastructure.

3.3	Natural Environment Sources:

3.3.1	The system shall include atomic oxygen generation capabilities capable of simulating energy levels and fluxes representative of the levels experienced in Low Earth Orbits.  

3.3.2	The system shall include low energy proton acceleration capabilities capable of simulating fluences seen at solar max.

3.3.3	The system shall include UV lamps capable of simulating the solar spectra at 2 times solar intensity.

3.3.4	The system shall include electron acceleration capabilities capable of simulating trapped electrons.
 
3.4	Spacecraft Self-induced Condition Simulation:

3.4.1	The system shall include the capability to introduce controlled levels of contamination to simulate the outgassing and redeposition of other satellite materials on the System Under Test.

3.4.2	The system shall include ion acceleration sources capable of simulating electric propulsion back-flux of low-energy Xenon ions.

3.4.3	The system shall include the capability to introduce an electric potential on the surface of the System Under Test to simulate the effects of spacecraft self-charging.

3.5	Threat Sources:  The system shall include three operationally relevant threat sources capable of simulating the effects of those threats on the satellite.

3.6	Connectivity to Satellite Operations Center:  The System shall allow the payload to be connected to the Satellite Operations Center in the Center for Research Support (CERES) at Schriever AFB, CO.  This will allow integrated operational test and evaluation, crew training, anomaly resolution utilizing actual hardware, the development of tactics, techniques and procedures, and assessment of system level vulnerabilities to natural and induced environments.  Due to the possibility of early utilization of the CCOSE chamber (see below) in Tactics, Techniques and Procedures development, connectivity must be achieved within the first 3 months of the program.

3.7	Existing Prototype:  The existing CCOSE chamber, located at AEDC was developed under the Test Technology Development and Demonstration program, and represents a subscale prototype and risk reduction effort.  This facility, and the technologies incorporated into it will be made available to the contractor to use in the development of the STAT facility.

DESCRIPTION:  Exhibit Services at the Tampa Convention Center.  REQUIREMENTS:  
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has a requirement for exhibit services type support at the Tampa Convention Center.

Historically Status of Forces Week events have the luxury of two days for set up and deal with industry exhibitors who are usually pretty well versed on installation of their equipment.  This year’s event will have government only exhibits.  In addition, set up time has been reduced to hours instead of days.  THE FOLLOWING TIMELINE MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO FACILITATE AN EXCELLENT DEMONSTRATION AND A TIMELY TEARDOWN OF THIS EXHIBITION!

The first to set up will be the camouflage netting.  The contractor must provide the stringing material (typically clear fishing line type material sufficient to hold netting and parachutes) to hang the chutes and netting from the ceiling.  At the direction of the government the positioning of the nets and chutes will be the direction of the Government on site coordinator.  Once initial overhead work is completed (no later than 0200 hours), the Government will bring in equipment and their demonstration booths.  The contractor will put carpeting in place in sections A and C.  The contractor will assist in getting vehicles, aircraft, boats and other equipment into the exhibit hall and in their proper position.  In addition, each of the four components of the command will set up their exhibit booths.  The Contractor will then set up hard walls, rope and stanchion, and USSOCOM Logo and black carpeting throughout the area as shown on the layout drawings provided.

All set must be completed by 1400 hours (2:00 p.m.) the same day.  The event will end approximately 2130 hours (11:30 p.m.) that evening and tear down will commence immediately.  The exhibit hall must be completely empty by 0400 hours (4:00 a.m.) 
26 April 07.  Must arrive at the Exhibit Hall Level (Center Section) to load and unload.

The contractor must provide sufficient crew to perform all overhead work in the first two hours of set up.

All materials, hard walls, display boards, pipe and drapes and stanchions with Rope must be clean, unmarred and presentable.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.
(End of provision)
 
Notice to Offerors:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  

Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Nov 2006),
Subparagraph (b) clauses: (1), (7),(8), (14-21), (24), (26) and (31). The Defense Priorities and Allocations System assigned Rating is DO-A1;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a U.S. Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

The equipment specifications are as follows: 

1.	Vacuum Specifications: The load on the vacuum system will be helium. The maximum throughput of the system will be 15 Torr*L/sec and the working pressure must not exceed 1x10^-3 Torr at this throughput. The base pressure for the system without a load shall be better than 2 x 10^-7 Torr. The load will be helium flowing into the vacuum chamber through a 5 micron pinhole nozzle at a temperature of 5-25 Kelvin and a stagnation pressure between 5 and 75 bar. The nozzle assembly is not part of this Request for Proposals (RFP).

2.	Diffusion Pump: A 20” vapor diffusion pump with a pumping speed of > 20,000 L/sec for helium is required. A pneumatically actuated gate valve shall be installed atop the diffusion pump. This gate valve should contain a side port for roughing out the volume above the gate valve, i.e. the custom chamber. The pump shall be supported by a welded frame with adjustable legs as depicted in Figures 1 and 2, and be tall enough to facilitate the changing of the heater elements in the diffusion pump. The diffusion pump shall include a quick cool feature to reduce the cool down time of the heaters and a back streaming minimization cap. The diffusion pump shall be installed with both thermal and water flow switches.

3.	Backing Pump Assembly: A roots blower and mechanical pump is required to back the diffusion pump. The specifications of the backing pump assembly shall be those appropriate for the diffusion pump described in item 4 under the helium load described in item 3. The backing pump assembly shall be mounted on a frame with adjustable feet and vibration damping. A pneumatically driven gate valve shall be installed atop the backing pump assembly to isolate it from the fore line. An oil back streaming filter/trap shall also be included.

4.	Custom Vacuum Chamber: A custom stainless steel chamber with four 6-inch CF-type flanges (100% compatible with the 6-inch Varian ConFlat) and four 2 ¾-inch CF-type flanges (100% compatible with the 2 3/4-inch Varian ConFlat) is required, as depicted in Figure 3. The chamber shall be nominally 10 inches tall and have the appropriate flanges on the top and bottom to mate with the diffusion pump and gate valve described in item 4. All CF-type flanges shall be welded as close to the central chamber as possible. The inside surfaces of the chamber shall be cleaned and finished in accordance with standard high-vacuum practices.

5.	Vacuum Chamber Top Flanges: Two custom flanges are required that mount atop the custom chamber described by item 6. The first flange will be constructed of stainless steel and include three 6-inch CF-type flanges (100% compatible with the 6-inch Varian ConFlat)  welded in a line and flush with the top of the flange. A second blank flange is required and is to be machined from of 2” thick acrylic. Both flanges are depicted at the top of Figure 3.

6.	Ultra-high Vacuum Gate Valve: A 6-inch ultra-high vacuum compatible, pneumatically actuated gate valve is required and shall be mounted to the custom chamber (item 6) as depicted in Figure 1. The gate valve shall contain a roughing port with access towards the custom chamber. The gate valve shall be fitted with 6-inch CF-type flanges (100% compatible with the 6-inch Varian ConFlat).

7.	Fore line and roughing lines: All fore lines and roughing lines shall be included, in accordance with Figures 1, 2, and 4. The main fore line between the backing pumps and the diffusion pump shall be constructed from PVC tubing using appropriate adapter flanges. All other lines shall be constructed of stainless steel. The location of the roughing pumps relative to the diffusion pump has not yet been determined; the PVC tubing shall provide a means to install and adapt the fore line on site. Each fore line and roughing line valve shall be pneumatically actuated. Each line shall be instrumented with convection type (or equivalent) vacuum gauges in accordance with Figures 1 and 4.

8.	Vacuum Gauges: In addition to the various convection type (or equivalent) gauges located along the fore and roughing lines, an ion gauge and its associated controller are required for measuring the vacuum in the custom chamber.

9.	Computer Control and Interlock System: A complete based computer control system is required for this vacuum assembly. The computer control system shall include a touch-screen interface, user programmability, and the ability to incorporate additional controllable devices or interlock sensors. The control system must be interfaced to every pressure gauge in the system, the water flow sensor and temperature sensors. The control system shall be able to actuate each valve, and turn on/shut off each pump and the water supply to the diffusion pump. The control system shall provide simple one-button programs for routine procedures such as a “pumping down” and “venting” the instrument. The controller shall be preprogrammed at the factory to properly handle a variety of failures (roughing vacuum failure, water failure, etc…) and include as a minimum the interlock scenarios listed in Figure 4. Means for bypassing individual interlocks shall be included. A program user’s guide shall be included so that the user may modify or create new control protocols.

10.	Misc. Hardware: All hardware and wiring necessary to complete this system shall be provided by the vendor. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, all gaskets/o-rings, mounting hardware (bolts/nuts, clamps), tubing, blank flanges on all unused ports, gauge and sensor wires/cables.

<DESC>RFQ   Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Peer  Comprehensive Peer Review of the Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers BACKGROUND:   A major challenge for VHA in recent years has been meeting the complex treatment needs of the severely injured service members. The methods of assault used in Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom, such as improvised explosive devices, can produce unique patterns of injury with the potential to inflict multi-system life threatening injuries. The term polytrauma-a new word in the medical lexicon-is now being used to describe the injuries to multiple body parts and organs that occur as a result of exposure to blasts.  Polytrauma is defined as two or more injuries to physical regions or organ systems, one of which may be life threatening, resulting in physical, cognitive, psychological, or psychosocial impairments and functional disability.  Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) frequently occurs in polytrauma in combination with other disabling conditions such as amputation, auditory and visual impairments, Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other mental health conditions.  Due to the severity and complexity of their injuries, service members and veterans with polytrauma require an extraordinary level of coordination and integration of clinical and other support services.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recognized that it must provide specialized care for military service members and veterans who sustain multiple and severe injuries.   As a result the VA has designated four Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers (PRC) located in Minneapolis, MN, Palo Alto, CA, Richmond, VA, and Tampa, FL. These centers offer unique and highly specialized rehabilitation; bringing experts together to provide innovative, personalized treatment to help the injured service member or veteran achieve optimal function and independence within a community.  The mission of the PRCs is to provide comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation services for individuals with complex physical and mental health sequelae of severe and disabling trauma and provide support to their families.  Intensive case management is essential to coordinate the complex components of care for polytrauma patients and their families. In addition to medical rehabilitation services, the Polytrauma Centers offer psychosocial support for both patient and family, and education and training to prepare patients and families for success after going home.  The PRCs coordinate the transfer and provision of health care for polytrauma patients within the VA and between VA and DoD and ensure timely access to veterans' benefits.  Coordination of rehabilitation services must occur seamlessly as the patient moves from acute hospitalization through acute rehabilitation and ultimately back to his/her home community.  The polytrauma teams of highly qualified rehabilitation experts blend unmatched experience with advanced technology and the creative spirit that has led to many important initiatives in the art and science of rehabilitation medicine.  With a positive and caring attitude, the Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers offer a powerful community of hope and possibilities.  B.  PURPOSE:  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a strong commitment to providing the highest quality specialized treatment and rehabilitation to veterans and service members with polytrauma. To this end the VA now has a requirement to complete a comprehensive peer review of the Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers.  The services under this contract provide an outside independent panel to complete a program evaluation of these four centers. The contractor must provide an international, independent, peer review system that is widely-recognized by federal agencies, state governments, major insurers, and leading professional rehabilitation groups, as well as by consumer and advocacy organizations.  Evaluations provided by the vendor must be in-depth and provided at the level of the individual program with a focus on the veteran receiving rehabilitation.   SCOPE OF WORK The contractor shall provide the resources needed to provide a full and comprehensive site evaluation to include:  (1) Survey personnel who are demonstrated subject matter experts in traumatic brain injury, polytrauma, injury rehabilitation and case management. Experience in war injury rehabilitation is highly desired.  (2) Comprehensive team of survey personnel who will complete the reviews at all four PRCs  (3) Materials and documents necessary to complete required reports. To evaluate the outcomes of the PRC, the Contractor shall conduct a comparison with a comparable comparison population and include this information in the summary report.  D.  EVALUATION APPROACH AND PROCESS:  The approach to evaluation will be based on validated standards as developed by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) and expanded criteria which include the following additional criteria (1) Application of the VHA Polytrauma Handbook, 1172.1 and VHA Directive 2005-024, Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers, (2) Adherence to all applicable VHA medical documentation requirements, (4) Patient and family interviews, (5) Polytrauma Case management consistent with VA Directive 2006-017 on the Role of VHA Points of Contact &amp; Case Managers to Coordinate Care for Returning Combat Service Members and Veterans and VHA Directive, 2006-043, Social Work Care Management in VHA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers, (6) DoD to VA transitions as outlined in Memorandum of Understanding between DOD and VA dtd. 12/13/2006 on Referral of Active Duty Military Personnel Who Sustain Spinal Cord Injury, Traumatic Brain Injury or Blindness to Veterans Affairs Medical Facilities for Healthcare &amp; Rehabilitative Services, (7) Continuity of Care and Inter-facility transfers as found in the following directives, (1) VHA Directive 2005-016, VHA National Interfacility Coordinated Care Policy and (2) VHA Directive 2005-045, Treatment of Active Duty Service Members in VA Healthcare Facilities as well as a review of the discharge planning processes and documentation. These reviews are to be designed to evaluate the quality of care being provided, identify strengths and weaknesses and give recommendations for improvement of the current VHA program related to polytrauma, TBI, rehabilitation, and concurrent mental health conditions such as PTSD.   The approach to the survey process includes an in-depth facility on-site peer review evaluation of each of the four VHA polytrauma centers, with exit interviews with facility leadership, followed by a preliminary written survey report to the COTR for each site.  A written summary report with oral presentation to VA executive leadership at the VA Central Office is also required.  Scheduling of the facilities that are to be surveyed will be coordinated by the COTR.    E.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS:  (1) The contractor will conduct site based program evaluations for Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers at individual VA facilities.

Statement of Objectives 2007 PRISM Gaming Initiatives 13 Mar 07 The purpose of the delivery order is to support Recruiting and Retention initiatives through the use of the PRISM gaming platform.  The support could include, but is not limited to, continuous gaming operations, improvement of current levels, development o f new levels, website and multiplayer support and planning and implementation of tournament and other marketing/advertising initiatives. Background and Current Environment:  The ARNG recently finished and released the PRISM gaming platform on PC (through CD) and online to include player matching online.  The development of the PRISM game platform has set groundwork from which future lead-ge neration and branding initiatives can be launched.  The PC Gaming market continues to grow and has proven to be a cost-effective way to reach the ARNG target audience. Performance Objectives:  The contractor shall be proposing a plan which directly addresses the below performance objectives: a)	The objective of the PRISM game is effective lead generation, branding of the ARNG product, multiple interactions with the prime target audience (17-24 year olds) and potential retention/attrition improvement. b)	The ARNG requires continuous improvement of the current PRISM game and development of new material in support of lead generation objectives through the year.  Throughout the employment of the game the contractor shall develop reporting methods/formats t o keep the government apprised of the progress of efforts. c)	The ARNG will need the contractor to propose online opportunities and additional markets to focus on which meet overall strength maintenance needs. d)	The ARNG will continue to need web/multiplayer support which is compatible with the numbers of gamers currently being facilitated as well as scalable to adjust to forecasted numbers to be handled during the year.  Web support should use best practices i n the gaming community to ensure ARNG initiatives are equitable with other leading gaming technologies used. Constraints:  All work accomplished should build upon the current PRISM platform technologies already employed by the ARNG.  The contractor must ensure continued compliance with applicable gaming and ESRB regulatory guidance.  All work accomplished must no t exceed the T rating that has already been awarded by the ESRB.   Timeline:  The contractor shall provide a Work Breakdown Structure and Quality Control Plan for all effort proposed.

 (c) The Contractor shall comply with the FAR clauses in this paragraph (c), applicable to commercial services, that the Contracting Officer has indicated as being incorporated in this contract by reference to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: 
 (d)  Comptroller General Examination of Record. The Contractor shall comply with the provisions of this paragraph (d) if this contract was awarded using other than sealed bid, is in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold, and does not contain the clause at 52.215-2, Audit and Records—Negotiation. 
(1) The Comptroller General of the United States, or an authorized representative of the Comptroller General, shall have access to and right to examine any of the Contractor’s directly pertinent records involving transactions related to this contract. 
(2) The Contractor shall make available at its offices at all reasonablthat services continue uninterrupted if the interpreter is able to do so.   Billings for such “continuing services” shall be in half-hour increments. 

The actual number of hours the interpreter is available per week is understood to be dynamic. It is understood that there may be some days where an earlier start or later finish is necessary.

The Government wishes to minimize costs by avoiding the necessity of having more than one interpreter on-station during the core periods on those occasions when the ordering calendar indicates a requirement for continuous support in excess of 1.5 hours.  Therefore, in these circumstances the Government will structure its activities to provide for a 10-15 minute break approximately 60 minutes into the activity and a second 10-15 minute break approximately 120 minutes into the activity.
 
Interpreter services will be conducted in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area, with travel away from the Headquarters Office location reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations as published by the GSA.  Travel will be primarily local.  Travel arrangements for the interpreter(s) for job-related functions beyond the Washington metropolitan area will be arranged by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) and the contractor. 

The primary on-site interpreter shall be designated by the contractor as the on-site manager for Government communication and technical direction to the secondary interpreter.  The Contracting Officer and the COTR are the main points of contact through which all contractor/Government communications and technical direction shall flow to the on-site manager.  The COTR is the primary Government point of contact for technical matters. The Contracting Officer should be contacted for contractual and business matters. The on-site manager shall collaborate with the COTR and perform all administrative support tasks needed to fulfill the contract.  Those administrative tasks include, but are not limited to, the following:
•	Maintaining an appointment log, taking all incoming requests for interpreter services.
•	Determining how these appointments will be covered; including the coordination of DOT’s Disability Resource Center service for FHWA deaf employees.
•	Scheduling appointments.
•	Responding to all incoming requests within the same day or the next business day.
•	Resolving scheduling conflicts for interpreting services.  (Standard procedures will be provided to the primary interpreter explaining what actions to be taken for most routine situations.)  Referring irresolvable or non-standard conflicts to the COTR 
3.	Ensuring the calendar is available for view to all deaf employees and the COTR with blocks of scheduled appointments.  This calendar will not show the details of the appointments, which are kept in the appointment log notebook.  This calendar will also be used by the COTR to verify hours worked against all invoices submitted.  
4.	Overtime (e.g., more than 8.5-hour day, Saturday/Sunday, and Federal Holidays) is rarely required.  Overtime must be approved by the CO in advance unless there are extenuating circumstances. 
II.1 ADDITIONAL ON CALL INTERPRETING SERVICES
In addition to the scheduled supplemental interpreting service referred to above, there is also periodic need for additional on-call interpreters to assist at training, conferences, or meetings, where two or more interpreters are needed to provide adequate support.  We estimate this requirement to represent about 50 hours of interpreting service annually.

II.2 VIDEO INTERPRETING SERVICE

In order to be prepared for future possible needs, offerors are requested to propose an option to provide the use of remote video interpreting services should the on-site interpreters not be available.  Availability or unavailability of this service will not affect the evaluation of interpreting service proposals.

II.3 ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES

Each business day, when a request for interpreter services comes in, the interpreter(s) are expected to respond to the request within the same day if possible, or the next business day.  A request form shall be filled out for each request.  If a cancellation occurs, the request form as well as the appointment log shall be annotated.  The request forms shall be filed in the FHWA Interpreter Services program office.  The interpreter shall schedule requests for appointments within the scheduled core hours, making every reasonable attempt to accommodate the customer.  

In the event of a scheduling conflict, the interpreter shall first contact DOT’s Disability Resources Center’s interpreting service for availability.  In a case of conflict, the interpreter may make recommendations for alternate times, or, with the customer’s approval, reschedule previously arranged appointments.  All requests that cannot be scheduled or requests that pose scheduling conflicts shall be referred to the COTR to determine the need for additional interpreters.  The interpreter, upon receipt of a work authorization by the COTR, will make every effort to provide the additional interpreter(s) when needed.  The interpreter shall notify the COTR if unable to resolve the assignments, if authorized coverage is going to be insufficient, or of any other issues related to scheduling the appointments.

If the interpreter shows up more than 15 minutes late to the assignment, the pay may be decreased by one hour.

When this occurs, the COTR will review the circumstances related to the late arrival and determine whether the lateness was the responsibility of the individual interpreter or circumstances beyond the individual interpreter's control.

Lateness due to circumstances beyond the individual interpreter's control will be excused.  Lateness due to any other reason, including those attributable to the interpreters or any other contractor staff members, contractors, or subcontractors will not be excused.

II.4 STAFFING 

As noted above, one individual the primary interpreter shall be designated as the on-site manager.  It is strongly preferred that a core team of two individuals provide the vast majority of interpreting service to our employees.  This will ensure continuity and consistency of service for the employees receiving the interpreting services.   

If additional interpreting services are required beyond the services provided by the on-site/on-call secondary interpreter, the request will be placed with the contractor at least 48 hours in advance, and will be billed to the agency at the “on-call” rate.

III.  ACCESS TO SENSITIVE INFORMATION  

Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information*, which shall not be disclosed by the contractor unless authorized by the CO.  To protect sensitive information, the contractor shall provide training to any contractor employee authorized access to sensitive information and, upon request of the Government, provide information as to an individual's suitability to have such authorization.  Contractor employees found by the Government to be unsuitable or whose employment is deemed contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national security may be prevented from performing work under the particular contract when requested by the CO.

New contractor employees should call for system access prior to entrance on duty. 
Once the new contractor employee has completed the on-line form successfully, the system will allow them to print three signature pages.  Please have them attach these pages to the DOT 1681, Identification Card/Credential Application, in order to complete the background investigation process. Copies of this form will be provided to the contractor at award.  The forms must be submitted to the Contracting Officer and to the FHWA Office of Human Resources for review and signature before submission to the DOT Office of Security.  The DOT Office of Security will issue the ID badge. Fingerprinting will be required as part of this process, and may take several days.

&#61656;	Understanding (Possible 10 points).  The Government will evaluate the understanding of the Government’s requirements and the work to be performed as demonstrated in the offeror’s proposal.

&#61656;	Management Plan (Possible 10 points) The Government will evaluate the effectiveness of the contractor’s management plan to meet FHWA’s requirements. Soundness of approach/methodology for completing the contract requirements will be considered. The contractor shall either have sufficient in-house staff, and/or access to qualified “free lance” independent contract interpreters to provide services to satisfy the requirements of this contract.

The Government will evaluate the relevance, quality, and extent of the offeror’s past performance in similar government and/or commercial contracts as it relates to the probability of successful performance of the SOW.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s working relationships with clients such as their overall performance, reliability, attitude, demeanor, effectiveness and customer service.  The offeror’s history of reasonable and cooperative behavior demonstrating sensitivity to the needs of the deaf will be considered. 

The Government will also evaluate the company’s procedures for tracking work assignments and keeping customers informed of pending interpreting requests.  The offeror’s commitment to customer satisfaction and reliability of the vendor’s point of contact regarding contracting issues or matters will be evaluated.                                                         

	3. Oral Presentation (Possible 30 Points)

Ability of proposed interpreters to interpret for individuals with a wide range of diverse communications backgrounds and from different occupations.

Ability of proposed interpreters to communicate orally in order to accurately and effectively, verbalize technical and/or confidential information to hearing individuals in interpreting situations.

*Past performance refers to the experience acquired by a firm as a whole, as opposed to the experience of individual firm members. The Past Performance information is limited to 4 pages and should identify the three most relevant contracts performed within the last six years. As a minimum, it should include the following:

Brief narrative of work performed, customer, contract number, performance period, contract type, total contract value, technical contact and phone number, business contact and phone number and an explanation of what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort.  Offerors shall also identify whether or not proposed personnel participated in the cited contracts; and if so, indicate their role.

The offeror has both the duty and discretion to determine which of its prior contracts are most relevant to the currently described requirements.  If unable to submit three (3) relevant contracts for past performance evaluation, it may submit a lesser number.  If the offeror possesses no relevant past performance, it should affirmatively state this fact.

The Government may obtain additional information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any source, including sources outside of the Government.  The Government may obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry. This information may include reviewing the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or past performance information from any source whatsoever.
 
Cost Factors

1. BASIC COSTS - an evaluation of the standard hourly rate, the overtime rate and on-call rate will be made for reasonableness. The potential total cost of all 5 years will be evaluated. Quotes that are materially unbalanced will be rejected.
	
		2. CANCELLATION POLICY – consideration will also be given to the flexibility of the cancellation policy of the company as well as to the costs that imposed under the contractor’s Cancellation Policy.

Basis for Award

Cost although not scored, will be a factor in the award decision. The proposals will be analyzed to assess cost reasonableness.  This is an assessment that the costs in an offeror’s proposal are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror’s technical proposal.  

The Government will accept the offer that is considered the best value to the Government.  A best value analysis will be performed taking into consideration the results of the technical evaluation, cost and past performance analysis, and perceived ability to perform timely, high quality, consistently reliable interpreter services as provided herein.

In the determination of Best Value, the relative weight given to all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, is more important than price. However, offerors should note that as technical scores approach being essentially equivalent, cost will become more important in the selection decision.

XI.  PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS

Cover Page (Standard Form 1449)
The offeror should provide an original signature on the Standard Form (SF) 1449 cover page.  Block 30b shall be signed to show that the offeror has read and agrees to comply with all the conditions and instructions provided in the solicitation document.

<DESC>This amendment is to clarify the requirement. This is a notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole-source order with United Electronics Corporation for the purchase of power generator support equipment. We require 100 amp power components that will be used to supply power for mobile communications packages which provide various communications services to local units and higher headquarters.  All components must be compatible with MILSPEC: MIL-C-22992 and must be capable of handling 100 amps.  We require components that can be customized specifically to connect to our power distribution system without any modification to ensure that our lines of communications do not fail.  We require 10 ea- 25 foot and 10 ea-50 foot cables assembled with a male connector on one end and a female connector on the other end,  20 ea- male and female box adaptors with a three foot pigtail on each phase, and 10 ea male and female cable end connectors.  Purchasing these items assembled alleviates us from purchasing tools/equipment needed to assemble these cables ourselves and allows us to ship them to our forward operating locations that are currently without these necessary components.

Description
TRITAC 100 amp cable end connector (female)- 10 ea
TRITAC 100 amp cable end connector (male)- 10 ea

For the exact text and wording of clauses and provisions please see http://farsite.hill.af.mil or http://www.arnet.gov/far/. Interested parties may respond via e-mail to matthew.keith@macdill.af.mil. We intend to issue a purchase order for delivery and installation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to United Electronics Corporation demonstrating the experience, knowledge, and capability to produce the required item. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.

<SUBJECT>58 -- UHF High Gain SATCOM Antennas
<SOLNBR>H92222-07-R-0055
<RESPDATE>012607
<CONTACT>Kathleen Henderson, Contract Specialist, Phone 813-281-0560 X304, Fax 813-281-2658, Email henderk@socom.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to RFP H92222-07-R-0055 is to post the Questions/Answers for the UHF High Gain SATCOM Antennas (RFP H9222207R0055) solicitation. Questions and Government Responses are as follows: 1.  The EDO DMC125 product is usually sold as a system, P/N SE78- 2-2.  The system consists of:  C125-2 antenna, tripod, case, and a 12 foot cable.  Does USSOCOM need the complete system?  Does USSOCOM require the 3 foot and 8 foot cable also or is this just for the Trivec-Avant (or Equal) items?
Response:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial off the shelf (COTS) items for Ultra High Frequency (UHF) High Gain Satellite Antennas.  For Contract Line Items (CLINs)  1001-5001, 1002-5002, 1003-5003, 1004-5004, 1005-5005, and 1006-5006, the Offerors shall propose their complete COTS system(s).  The purpose of the RF Coaxial Cable CLINs is for the Government to purchase different lengths of RF Coaxial cables as needed.  The Offerors are highly encouraged to propose RF Coaxial Cables (CLINs 1009-5009, 1010-5010, 1011-5011, 1012-5012, and 1013-5013) applicable to any proposed antenna(s).  The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the Offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.  2.  Please confirm the SATCOM radio interface connector is a type N female so that our BNC male to type N male cable will satisfy your requirement.  Response:  The SATCOM radio interface connector on the AN/PSC-5D radio is a BNC Female.    3.  The Statement of Work, Requirements, paragraph 2.5 refers to high and low angle modes for the AV 2091-2 (or equal).  The AV 2091-2 (or equal) is a single port antenna with right hand circular polarization minimum gain of +6 dBi at the zenith and incidental vertical/linear gain at other angles with no explicitly separate modes.  What is the intent of high and low angle modes for this antenna?  Response:  The intent of the high and low angle (elevation) modes for SATCOM on the Move (SOTM) is to identify the gain measurements for the antenna(s) in both angles given the proximity of the satellite to the radio.  When the satellite is close to or near to the horizon, the antenna performance will be less than if the satellite is at zenith.  The ability to operate a radio in different modes when the satellite is near the horizon may depend in part on several variables to include the gain to the antenna.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (Amendment 7) to solicitation H92222-07-R-0055, UHF Satellite Command (SATCOM) Antennas, is to cancel the Government requirement for CLIN 1005 thru 5005, AV 2091-2 or Equal Product.  The Government cancellation of CLIN 1005 thru 5005, AV 2091-2 or Equal Product, is the result of the Government issuing an inaccurate specification for this requirement.  The Government intends to resolicit at a later date for the AV 2091-2 or Equal Product.  The Government also cancels the requirements for CLINs 1009 thru 5009, Cable RF Coaxial, 3 foot, Max Qty 5,000 (Year 1 thru 5); CLINs 1010 thru 5010 Cable RF Coaxial, 8 foot, Max Qty 5,000 (Year 1 thru 5); CLINs 1011 thru 5011 Cable RF Coaxial, 12 foot, Max Qty 5,000 (Year 1 thru 5); CLINs 1012 thru 5012 Cable RF Coaxial, 25 foot, Max Qty 5,000 (Year 1 thru 5); CLINs 1013 thru 5013 Cable RF Coaxial, 150 foot, Max Qty 5,000 (Year 1 thru 5).  The Government requirement for Coaxial Cables is unwarranted for this solicitation as the Government no longer has a current requirement for the cables.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to RFP H92222-07-R-0055, UHF High Gain SATCOM Antenna is as follows:  1) Delete CLIN 1007 as described/stated in Amendment 5; 2) Add the following revised CLIN 1007 description: CLIN 1007 Technical Data (Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL)), Not Separately Priced (NSP), CDRL A001 ? Commercial Off The Shelf Manuals.  For proposal purposes, the Government will provide CDRL A001 (electronic version)to the Offeror, upon request.  The Contractor shall provide COTS manuals with each antenna (1:1 ratio). All CDRLs are electronic submission; and 3) Post the Questions/Answers for the UHF High Gain SATCOM Antennas (RFP H9222207R0055) solicitation. Questions and Government Responses are as follows: Question 1: CLINs 1007 through 5007 require pricing for CDLS with maximum quantities stated for each year. We understand this to be the Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), as described in section 3.0 of the SOW. The SOW describes this as all qualified labor, supervision, materials, equipment, tools, appliances and services to repair the antennas at the contractor's facility and ship the antannas back to the government. It further requires the contractor to obtain Government authorization prior to beginning any repair on an antenna, and to provide to the Government a written estimate of the repairs, including the cost of materials and labor required for the repair. Depending on the nature of the damage to be repaired, this cost could cover a very wide range, from a minimal action to repairs costing  up to 65% of the value of a new antenna. Therefore, it is difficult to make a estimate of the cost of an average repair for each CLIN. Any clarification or guidance the Government may be able to provide will be appreciated. Response 1: The Government intends to amend the solicitation to delete the Contractor Depot Logistics Support. Question 2: The SOW only establishes the technical requirements and repair of the antennas, not the new procurement requirement.
Do you think that paragraph 1.0 of the SOW should be more specific by mentioning procurement also? Response 2: The intent of the combined synopsis/solicitation is to define the Government's UHF High Gain Antenna procurement requirements (in a streamlined approach) in the solicitation document posted on 19 Dec 06.  This solicitation document provides the procurement requirements for this effort. The SOW included in the solicitation is exclusive to defining the UHF High Gain Antenna specifications/requirements only. Question 3:  It is uncertain as to what data should be supplied under CLIN 1007 of solicitation H9222-07-R-0055.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to RFP H9222207R0055 is to post the Questions/Answers for the UHF High Gain SATCOM Antennas (RFP H9222207R0055) solicitation. Questions and Government Responses are as follows:  1. Cable requirements: a. In the SOW at paragraph 2.1, the 150 ft. cable replaces the two (2) 12.5 ft. cables normally supplied with Trivec-Avant Corporation (TAC) AV-2011.  This will increase the weight of the system by 16 lbs to 56 lbs.  If the 150 ft. cable in the AV-2011 system replaces the two (2) 12.5 ft. cables, will the part number need to be differentiated from the AV-2011? b. In the SOW at paragraph 2.2, the 150 ft. cable replaces the two (2) 12.5 ft. cables normally supplied with TAC AV-2012.  This will increase the weight of the system by 15 lbs to 36 lbs.  If the 150 ft. cable in the AV-2012 system replaces the two (2) 12.5 ft. cables, will the part number need to be differentiated from the AV-2012?  c.	In the SOW at paragraph 2.3, the two (2) cables (8 ft and 12 ft) replace the 6 ft. cable normally supplied with TAC AV-2040-2.  This will increase the weight of the system by 0.5 lbs to 7 lbs.  If the two (2) cables, 8 ft and 12 ft, in the AV-2012 system replace the two (2) 12.5 ft. cables, will the part number need to be differentiated from the AV-2040-2? d. In the SOW at paragraph 2.4, the two (2) cables (8 ft and 12 ft) replace the 6 ft. cable normally supplied with TAC AV-2055-3.  This will increase the weight of the system by 0.5 lbs to 3.5 lbs.  If the two (2) cables, 8 ft and 12 ft, in the AV-2055-3 system replace the two (2) 12.5ft cables, will the part number need to be differentiated from the AV2055-3?  Government Response:  The solicitation will be amended to identify five (5) additional and separate CLINs for the Coaxial RF cables:  3 ft,  8 ft, 12 ft, 25 ft, and 150 ft.  The Statement of Work will identify the commercial requirements for the systems without the additional cable replacements.  2.  Would the above changes be considered as exceptions to the Government?s technical requirements? Government Response:  No.  As stated above, the solicitation will be amended to add five (5) additional and separate CLINs for the five (5) Coaxial RF cables (3 ft, 8 ft, 12 ft, 25 ft and 150 ft.).  3.  For forward pricing matters, please clarify whether the Government has an expected award date that the bidder should use to define its contract years, or shall the bidder simply assume a reasonable "Contract Year" starting date, such as 01 Jun 2007? Government Response:  FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items,(10)(c), "Period for acceptance of offers.  The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation."  The intent of the Government is to award without discussions 30 calendar days from proposal due date unless otherwise noted.

Solicitation (RFP) TRN-07-010
Amendment No. 2
Responses To Questions --

QUESTION: The government requests rates for handling redelivery of commodities.  What is meant by redelivery?
ANSWER: Redelivery of commodities involves the transport of commodities from the warehouse to the MIA airport or other regional airport.  This means the warehouse contractor must arrange for a conveyance and a driver, load the conveyance and transport the commodities to the Miami or other regional airport.--- 

QUESTION: Does this warehouse space have to be set aside for the exclusive use of  USAID, or can it be 30,000 square feet of a larger warehouse that is used for other goods/clients?
ANSWER:  The 30,000 square feet of warehouse space must be exclusive to USAID, but this space may be part of or within a larger warehouse facility.--- 

QUESTION: Define "secure warehouse space."  For instance, if the 30,000 sq. ft. space was a portion of a larger warehouse, would the 30,000 sq. ft. require it's own internal fencing and security in addition to the facilities general security?
ANSWER: The facility shall be secure and protect the USAID commodities from loss or damage.  The USAID warehouse space does not require separate security in addition to the general security of the facility.  USAID does expect the general security to be sufficient to properly secure and protect our commodities.  The general security shall meet best commercial practice standards for general warehouse commodities and vehicles.---

QUESTION: What is the government expectation of volumes of commodities to be delivered to, or re-delivered from, this facility?
ANSWER: Based upon historical records, the government expects to deliver about 10 trailer-loads to the warehouse facility during the year.  The government expect to re-deliver about 10 to 15 trailer-loads from the facility to the MIA airport during the year.  This level may fluctuate based upon the number of emergency responses USAID undertakes during the year. ---

QUESTION: What are your expectations for normal business hours? 
ANSWER: Normal business hours are at the discretion of the contractor, but generally may be between 0700 and 1800 hours. ---

QUESTION: How often does the government require evening or weekend operations?
ANSWER: Normally, only outbound (re-delivered) shipments require evening or weekend operations to accommodate emergency operations.  The government expects 10 to 15 evening or weekend shipments per year.---
