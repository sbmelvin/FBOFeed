<DESC>NAICS Code:  541511 and the Small Business Size Standard is $23 million.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a single source contract with Innovation Data Processing of Little Falls, NJ for 12-months of software maintenance for FDR Compaktor/PATs Software.  The U.S. EPA believes that Innovation Data Processing is the only source capable of providing this software maintenance.  The period of performance is expected to be from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011 with the possibility of four (4), one (1) year option periods.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required software maintenance should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.
The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any response(s) exist and therefore no Request for Quote (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a contract will be placed with Information Data Processing.  Submit your response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), Attn:  Dan Neustedter, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 or e-mail Neustedter.Dan@epa.gov.
