<CONTACT>Paul Griffin Contract Specialist 9077863818     paul_griffin@fws.gov;
<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska, on behalf of the Appraisal Services Directorate (ASD), in accordance with a seperate Memorandum of Understanding, requires contracting appraisal services for the valuation of non-Federal and Federal properties for a proposed land exchange between Doyon, Limited (Doyon), an Alaska Native Regional Corporation within the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS). If the proposed exchange were to occur, Doyon would receive free title to approximately 108,028 acres of Refuge lands and approximately 93,800 acres of leasable mineral estate that may hold developable oil and gas resources.  In exchange, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Government of the United States) would receive free title lands of equal value currently owned by Doyon, including quality wetland habitats, within the Refuge boundary.  Once approved, the appraisals will provide decision makers a basis to consummate and/or reconfigure the land exchange.  This significant exchange is complex and likely to draw controversy. To be awarded this appraisal contract, the contractor/principal appraiser must be licensed as a General Certified Appraiser in the State of Alaska.  The contractor will be expected to prepare the appraisals that are technically and legally defensible and in full compliance with the current edition of Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions, 2000 Edition (UASFLA) and the Statement of Work included in the solicitation.  All appraisal services will be paid for by the United States of America, US Fish and Wildlife Service.  ASD will be the sole client for the appraisals.  Doyon and FWS will be intended users, in addition to ASD. The contractor will be responsible for all aspects of developing and reporting the appraisals.  The contractor will be required to comply with the professional competency requirements in an appraisal assignment that includes potential contributory values of oil and gas, potential impacts on value of a public use easement and a subsistence easement, it is likely that the principal contract appraiser will have to complete the assignment leading a team of private staff appraisers, associate appraisers and oil and gas consultant(s) experienced with the physical environment of Interior Alaska.  Knowledge and experience of Alaska land laws such as the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) is required.  After submission to ASD the appraisals will be subjected to a technical appraisal review in compliance with Standard 3 of USPAP, Section C of UASFLA and the current version of the Appraisal Policy Manual of the U.S. Department of the Interior.  After completion and approval of the appraisals provided under the terms and conditions of the awarded contract, if necessary and requested by the contracting officer, the contractor may be required to provide additional services related to this procurement. An example would be if the contractor must be available for additional valuation services related to the exchange, such as appraisal of a reconfigured exchange and/or appraisal dispute resolution. Should events such as this example occur, the additional or reduction in services would be further negotiated and incorporated into the scope of work as a change order to the awarded contract. A detailed listing of specific services to be provided are detailed in Section C of the solicitation.  This contract will be for one firm year and one option year for a total contract period of performance of two years.  All contractor's must be registered on the Central Contractor Registration in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations subpart 4.11.  For registration information visit the web site http://www.ccr.gov. The solicitation issue date will be approximately March 13, 2007.

<DESC>This announcement is provided as an update to the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) Request for Information (RFI) previously released on October 10, 2006. The RFI formally announced the department's intent to execute a competitive procurement for emergency transportation services and requested industry input on an attachment of questions related to the core requirements and acquisition strategy for the future solicitation. The RFI explained OST's ESF#1 functions under the National Response Plan (NRP) and provided industry with the government's concept of operations for an emergency transportation environment. Responders to the survey provided insightful information on state of the art technology, innovative approaches to transporting evacuees and life sustaining products, industry capabilities and best practices. Industry responses were received on November 3, 2006. 

After review of industry's responses and in consideration of lessons learned in the Post Hurricane Katrina aftermath, the government has decided to change the original scope of the requirements to focus primarily on the movement of goods, equipment, and personnel. This change in scope excludes requirements related to the conduct of mass evacuations of the general population, including using bus, air, maritime and rail services for evacuation purposes. However, key components that remain include the integration of effective tracking systems for assets as well as comprehensive dispatch, fleet management and other services.

Instructions to Interested Offerors: OST intends to release a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for Industry comment in the early April 2007 timeframe. The government will provide specific instructions for Industry in the draft RFP release. All interested offerors are requested to submit a statement of interest on the future solicitation in response to this announcement. The statement of interest should be submitted on company letterhead, and identify a company point of contact. Additionally, the Government may hold an Industry Day for interested offerors. The letter of interest should indicate each company's interest in participating in an Industry Day.

All submittals to this announcement should be provided electronically to the following email address: darryl.anderson@dot.gov. Please contact Darryl Anderson, Contracting Officer, for any questions on this announcement.  

Any information provided under this announcement is for informational purposes only. No evaluation of a vendor's response will occur. All interested parties are advised that OST will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this announcement.

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, 
Tara Petersen

Telephone number 719-333-2074
FAX 719-333-9018
email:  tara.petersen@usafa.af.mil

Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and award to Aero Simulation, Inc (ASI), located at 4450, E. Adamo Drive, Suite 501, Tampa, FL 33605-5941, a contract for the CH-46E Weapon System Trainer (WST) incorporation of the Control Display Navigation Unit (CDNU) Operational Flight Program (OFP) 9.2. This modification includes upgrading the CDNU Operational Trainer Program (OTP) from version 8.0 to version 9.2 and implements the Aircraft Integration Maintenance System (AIMS) Capability. In addition, this modification will include the installation of Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) H-46-145 Engine Electrical Overspeed. 

The anticipated date for award is 18 May 2007.  Delivery shall be 270 days after receipt of order. This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1( only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). ASI is and has been the sole developer and integrator of the CH-46E APT Device 2F172, and has the only proven process for installing the Trainer I/O  Systems for the CH-46E Trainers. Given the limited documentation on the I/O software modification, and the level of system knowledge required to upgrade the prior version of the CDNU OPT ( Ver. 8.0) to the new release (Ver. 9.2), ASI is considered the sole source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equiment and experienced personnel necessary to successfully fulfill the government's requirements within current budget and time constraint. 
A solicitation will be issued on or about 10 April 2007. 
This procurement will result in a FFP contract. See numbered note 22 (substitute fifteen for forty five days). Response may be made by email to: T’ann.Perrault@navy.mil or the address above. For information regarding this procurement, contact: T’ann Perrault at 407-380-4723 . A determination not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), Superfund/RCRA Regional Procurement Operations Division (SRRPOD) will issue a solicitation for Technology Transfer and Training Support program for the EPA?s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER), Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI). 	The EPA Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation seeks the support of a contractor with demonstrated expertise and understanding of the Superfund program and the issues surrounding the technologies for site cleanup, including regulatory and technical issues, large scale project management, and emerging technological approaches to characterization and remediation of Superfund sites.   The mission of Superfund?s technology and training program is to provide world-class technology information and expert field and laboratory support to customers who respond to emergency releases of hazardous materials and manage longer-term site assessment and remediation projects. Superfund is looking for support in identifying subject matter experts in the full range of cleanup technologies, from emerging technologies to established methods for addressing hazardous waste cleanup; and in disseminating the information from these experts to the professionals conducting hazardous waste cleanup.  EPA anticipates requiring technology research and report preparation, cost documentation, and analysis of remediation strategies. EPA will also need contractor services in delivering extensive, state-of-the-practice advisory and technical assistance to site managers supporting characterization, remedy design, and remedy optimization. EPA requires experts in both hazardous waste technology and in communications to prepare and conduct information and knowledge transfer, including but not limited to, seminars, meetings, conferences, training, and webcasts on scientific and technical issues related to emergency response and remediation of sites, appropriate assessment and integration of innovative technologies into site cleanup plans.  Logistical support to secure meeting space and registrations is incidental to this activity.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Pamela Smith, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-0635
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Genedata, Inc. 1601 Trapelo Rd, suite 350, Waltham, MA 02451, for the acquisition of a one year license for Genedata Screener software. The National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT)is embarking on a new program, ToxCast, which requires the collection and management of large volumes of high-throughput screening (HTS) data. Current plans include testing chemicals in batches ranging into the thousands  through  assays numbering in the hundreds. Each of these tests, i.e. one chemical in one assay, will produce data needing curating, storage and analysis. Scientists traditionally relied on spreadsheet programs to manage assay results. However, this is completely impractical for the amount of data generated  through HTS approaches. NCCT requires a database and tools that must have the following capabilities: (1) Flexibility in building templates for calculation of raw plate-based data; (2) Visualization of plate-based data for QC analysis; (3) Robust concentration-response curve fitting routine;(4)  Ability to link chemicals in sample plates to assay results; (5) Operational database supporting mass storage of data and analysis results. A large amount of data for ToxCast will be generated at the National Institutes of Health, Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC). Their unique approach to HTS,  termed quantitative HTS (qHTS), tests all chemical in concentration-response format. This presents unique challenges in dat QC and management. Curve fitting routines must be extremely robust to routinely and efficiently handle thousands of test results. This is an absolutely critical step in the  analysis of collaboration with NCGC. In addition, other products have laborious procedures required to build specific templates for calculating raw data for HTS assays. Because ToxCast will be acquiring data from a number of different sources and for a large number of different assays (hundreds),  the ability to easily build templates for data calculation sophisticated visualization of plate-based data, an interface to link sample information with assay results, and an operational database sufficient to meet the long-term requirements of the ToxCast Program. The EPA has identified Genedata,  Inc., the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. In order to ensure data compatibility and accuracy The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 13.106(B)"Only one source reasonably available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s)  exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit  written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. No telephonic or faxed request  will be honored.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Quantum Design, 6325 Lusk Boulevard, San Diego, CA 92121-3733, for the purchase of an upgrade to an existing Magnetic Property Measurement System (that uses a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device for the measurement) (MPMS SQUID) Magnetometer System for a helium reliquification system.  Sole source determination is based on the NIST requirement to significantly reduce the overall liquid helium consumption and to permit the MPMS SQUID Magnetometer to remain operational during shortages of liquid helium by capturing the gaseous helium from the dewar, cooling it until it re-liquefies, and returning it to the dewar.  It is essential that this ?cryocooler? be able to communicate with the existing magnetometer?s software so that the pump can be turned off during sensitive measurements in order to eliminate noise and that the dewar also be able to communicate with the software in order to track the level of liquid helium.  As a result, Quantum Design is uniquely qualified to provide the required upgrade.  No other company has the knowledge or the ability to replace the dewar and its meters with a re-liquefying dewar and meters that interface with the controlling software, which is proprietary, allowing the re-liquefier?s pumps to be controlled in conjunction with the magnetic measurements for noise control.  

Delivery shall be FOB Destination and be completed in accordance with the Contactor?s commercial schedule.

As defined in the federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), FOB Destination means:  The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at delivery point specified in the purchase order, and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The synopsis posted on 3/14/2007 is hereby revised to correct the length of the contract from "a base period of 12 months and five (5) twelve month option periods" to "a base period of 12 months and four (4) twelve month option periods", and to also correct the specified FIPS compliance from FIPS-102 to FIPS-201.  The corrected synopsis is as follows: 

The Federal Technology Service of the General Services Administration (GSA), intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to procure Personal Identify Verification (PIV) Integration Contractor support for a Personal Identity Verification (PIV)-II solution for Treasury Departmental Offices (DO) and Bureaus.  The Government will award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract, with a base period of 12 months and four (4) twelve month option periods.  Firm Fixed Price task orders will be issued under the resultant IDIQ contract.  Proposals will be accepted only from eligible Integration Contractors who are currently on the GSA approved list of HSPD-12 Integration Service providers, and all products proposed must be from approved product Contractors as mandated by OMB Memo M-06-18.  This requirement will provide an end-to-end PIV solution that is compliant with FIPS-201 and NIST Special Publications.  This requirement will be initialized in various phases throughout the lifecycle, ultimately covering all Treasury, and possibly Bureau, specific requirements.  The contractor shall provide the following support:  1)  deliver an End-to-End PIV solution that is in compliance with FIPS 201 and NIST Special Publications;  2)  provide customization of the acquired End-to-End PIV solution to meet Treasury and Bureaus specific requirements as documented in the System Requirement Report (SRR) and System Architecture Report (SAR);  3)  provide full integration of the PIV solution within Treasury and Bureau network infrastructure and Treasury PKI;   4)  provide all PIV solution components, develop installation packages of hardware & software, and deliver installation instructions for bureau-level components of the PIV solution;  5)  support Operations and Maintenance of the deployed system in such areas as Help desk support, defect resolution, and training;  6)  support Bureau specific implementation of PIV processes.  

This procurement will utilize a “best value” source selection process to enable selection from among high quality contractors for this procurement ultimately resulting in a single award. For this procurement, technical factors when combined are more important than price.  The Technical evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance as follows:  “Technical Approach”, “Management Plan”, “Corporate Experience & Past Performance,” and “Extent of Participation of Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Concerns”.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used as set forth in FAR 15.  Offerors are advised an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the government.  Therefore, proposals should be initially submitted on the most favorable terms. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP), consisting of the solicitation and all attachments, will be issued and posted electronically on the www.fedbizopps.gov website.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Kristin L. Markiewicz, GSA Contract Specialist, at (215) 446-5808 (Kristin.Markiewicz@gsa.gov) or James B. VanAllan, GSA Contracting Officer, at (215) 446-5843 (James.VanAllan@gsa.gov).  This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAICS Code 541990.  The solicitation should be available on or about 03/29/2007.

Delete paragraph (a) 1.1. and replace with the following (changed language is in bold) 1.1 An award shall be made to that single responsive, respo nsible offeror whose quote conforms to the RFQ and represents the best value to the Government in terms of the evaluation criteria and other considerations specified within the RFQ.  The Government is willing to accept other than the low price, minimally a cceptable quote should the added benefits/quality of a higher priced quote justify the additional price. Technical approach and key personnel are considered equal. When combined, all evaluation factors are significantly more important than price; however, price will be given more importance as the proposals approach equality. Option prices will be included for evaluation purposes only and will not obligate the Government to exercise options.  Delete paragraph (a) 3.3.3. Completeness. Insert the following: (a) 3.3.3. Past Performance- The contractor must provide references for at least two comparable projects, with a narrative description of the project.

<SUBJECT>B--Conduct Research on Detection and Monitoring of Major Ecosystem Disturbances
<SOLNBR>07CR14-NoSolicitation
<RESPDATE>041607
<ARCHDATE>03142008
<CONTACT>ROBERT VALDEZ CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3032369336     rvaldez@usgs.gov;
<DESC>Concerns having the ability to conduct research on detection and monitoring of major ecosystem disturbances described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 30 calendar days from the date of this synopsis. The U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS), has a requirement to develop a methodology to detect and characterize major disturbance types to monitor state and trends of ecosystems and to update USGS baseline database in land cover and vegetation cover.  Two groups of change detection algorithms need development, one for use with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroraeiometer) data and the other for use with Landsat images.  The proposed research includes developing, testing and validating these algorithms.  The development of the MODIS land cover change detection algorithm will be to achieve two capabilities - separating fires from clear-cut/harvesting, and detection of partial disturbances caused by insect, disease, and/or storm damage, as well as minor disturbances such as thinning.  In addition, the algorithm will be used to produce change products for the entire U.S. using available MODIS data from 2001 to 2006.  The developed change products will be validated using Landsat images for selected locations, including at least one in southeast U.S. and one in Pacific northwest U.S.  The Landsat task requires two types of temporal analyses.  For areas where substantial changes occur every year, at lease one Landsat image will need to be acquired in order to map those changes on a yearly basis. A multi-temporal change mapping algorithm will be needed to analyze such an annual image stack.  For areas where substantial changes only occurred in a specific year, mapping those changes requires a pre-change image and a post-change image as well as a bi-temporal change mapping algorithm.  Both the multi-temporal and bi-temporal change mapping algorithms will be developed through this project.  Because they are both intended for use in an operational system, they will be highly automatic.  In both cases, automation will be achieved by automatic delineation of core forest pixels.  The bi-temporal change mapping algorithm will use advanced classifiers.  Because the developed algorithms are intended for use across the entire U.S., they will be tested and validated at locations representing different biomes of the U.S. including eastern forests, western forests, as well as semiarid environment and other forest ecosystems.  Improvements to the developed algorithms will be made for areas where the validation results indicate inefficiencies.  Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the items specified as a sole source from University of Maryland, College Park, MD, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that university. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required item/services or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, request for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice to the procurement.  See Numbered Note 22.

The EDISON software application will provide the basic images of passports, visas, and other travel documents from around the world.  The application in conjunction with the EDISON hardware will have the following capabilities: show watermarks within documents, show retro-reflective features on documents, show UV activated features on documents, show holograms on documents. The EDISON’s web-based Travel Document Database system and software application meets all of CS/FPP’ technical requirements and is known as a standard in the business.  The EDISON program is an intergovernmental consortium, led by the Dutch with cooperation from Australia, Canada, and the United States.  DHS’ Forensic Document Laboratory contributes to EDISON document exemplars, some of which originate with CA.  The database is published in various forms, including books, a commercially available internet-based program, and government-only versions. The version FPP propose to procure is a government “Control” level which is available in electronic form with no need to install on individual PCs.  This version has also been procured by DHS’s Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for use at U.S Ports of Entry. Based on the technical capability of EDISON it has been determined that another viable source would not be able to provide CA/FFP with compatible software application to compliment the already purchased hardware<BR><BR>

<DESC>Scope of Objectives<br>
Provide technical assistance for the development of updated descriptive statistics for aquatic habitat parameters.<br>
<br>
Introduction:  Watershed Analyses on the Tongass National Forest make frequent use of natural ranges of variation for select stream attributes published in Bryant 2004.  An expansion of the original dataset allows us the opportunity to repeat these analyses and provide updated statistics.  Additionally a recent publication by Woodsmith (2005) offers additional metrics that can be efficiently analyzed during this effort.<br>
<br>
This scope of work covers the statistical analysis of a set of aquatic data.  The contractor should be proficient with statistical software programs, statistical methodologies, analysis of ecological data and time-series analysis.<br>
<br>
The contractor will do the following:<br>
<br>
1) Provide updated statistical tables for eight aquatic habitat measures published in Bryant 2004.  Provide the same type of statistical tables for three additional habitat measures listed Woodsmith’s 2005 publication.<br>  
<br>
2) Provide statistics and graphs describing variation of the above measures through time (wherever the data allows).<br>  
<br>
3) Explore different types of stream segments stratifications.  Use those stratifications that are most effective for decoupling human-caused and natural changes to the above measures.<br>
<br>
Deliverables are: 1) An updated statistical table for the eight originally published aquatic habitat parameters plus the three selected variables from Woodsmith (2005).<br>
<br>
2) A written description of the methodologies involved in the calculations.<br>  
<br>
3) Written recommendations about the future of this dataset from a statistical perspective.<br>  
<br>
Milestones: Begin work March 27, 2007; review progress after 2 weeks on April 8, 2007 Project completed by May 1, 2007.<br>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis for market research.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The following information is requested to the assist the United States Marine Corps Direct Reporting Program Manager, Advanced Amphibious Assault (DRPM AAA) in conducting market research of industry.  The EFV will replace the Assault Amphibian Vehicle (AAV). The EFV is a “concept based requirement” that supports the concepts of Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, to include, Forcible Entry from the Sea, Distributed Operations, and Sea Basing.  EFVs will carry the surface assault echelons at sea-speeds four times that of the AAV, as part of multi-dimensional attacks through littoral penetration points to join deep inland with forces vertically lifted by MV-22 Osprey. On reaching the shore from their over-the-horizon launch point, EFVs will have the speed to maneuver with the M1A1 tanks and Light Armored Vehicles (LAVs) and the sustainment to continue the assaul!  t deep inland for link up with vertical assault forces, or independent maneuver.  Additionally, the EFV provides the necessary capability to meet security challenges across the spectrum of conflict; to include Irregular Operations, not available in any other platform.  The EFV will provide Marines mobility equal to the M1A1 Tank, a 30mm cannon capable of precision fires employed at the squad level, significantly increased survivability with respect to Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) effects and ballistic protection, and a communication suite that will greatly enhance a unit’s combat effectiveness and assist in the identification of friendly and enemy forces on the battlefield via a common operational picture.  The United States Marine Corps has a requirement for an auxiliary sight for the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) weapon system.  The auxiliary sight shall provide the gunner and/or vehicle commander the capability to accurately employ the primary (MK 44, 30mm) and !  secondary (M240C, 7.62mm) weapon systems of the MK 46 turret in the ev ent of the loss of the gunner’s primary sight or turret power.  The auxiliary sight shall be permanently integrated into the MK 46 turret of the EFV.  Responses to this request should be for an Off-the-Shelf solution.  It is important to note to any prospective vendor that the USMC is not interested in developing an auxiliary sight.  The USMC interest extends to the mounting/integration of the auxiliary sight into the MK 46 turret of the EFV.  The auxiliary sight should have the following capabilities:  a. Provide visual sighting for the main gun and maintain elevation alignment without power;  b. Provide visual detection of threat targets (2.05 meter x 2.05 meter) to range of 1 km for day use only; c. Provide a means to boresight to the primary weapon and to maintain the boresight alignment to within +/- 5mils under the operational environments of the EFV;  d. Maintain elevation alignment with the primary weapon from -10 to +45 degrees of elevation;  e. Provide a passive me!  ans of range determination;  f. Provide coatings for user eye protection against lasers;  g. Withstand the operational environments of the EFV; h. Provide overhead ballistic protection for any portion of the auxiliary sight external to the turret structure.   All vendors having the capability of meeting these requirements are requested to submit copies of relevant documentation in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis at no cost to the Government.  Contractors should include appropriate literature, brochures, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned capabilities.  Contractors should submit responses electronically to Krista Francom at FrancomKA@efv.usmc.mil no later than 5:00 PM EST on April 10, 2007.  It is emphasized that this information is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for informati!  on solicited.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a cop y of the solicitation.  It is a potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted.  No telephonic responses will be accepted.  Questions should be directed to:  Krista Francom at 703-490-7226 or FrancomKA@efv.usmc.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center - Training Systems Division (NAWC-TSD) has a requirement to provide curriculum and courseware support for the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA).

The CNATRA mission is to train Pilots, Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) and Enlisted Air Crewmen for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as several foreign countries, through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The overall goal / objective is to produce military qualified aviators that meet the skill requirements of a diverse client base optimized to a production and completion schedule that integrates with customer demand.

  The Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) for Aviation Training and Standardization, CNATRA N7, is tasked with the study, analysis, design, definition, development, documentation, implementation, training management, Revision and Maintenance (R&M), and standardization of all aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials. This N7 tasking includes management and organizational support, front end analysis, labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training devices, supervision and other services necessary to support all Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM) classroom, simulator, and flight training programs; including extensive on-site support at the locations identified below.

Located at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) oversees the Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM), which includes five Training Air Wings located on five Naval Air Stations in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.  The five wings are home to 17 Training Squadrons.  In addition, Joint Services Training (JST) is also conducted with the Air Force on bases in Oklahoma and Texas.  There are six NATRACOM locations that support the primary mission of the CNATRA, including the N7 centrally managed Flight Training Support Center (FTSC).  

NATRACOM squadrons log approximately 400,000 flight hours each year in seven types of training aircraft/platforms with a total compliment of over 750 airplanes.  More than 1,800 pilots and Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) earn their “Wings of Gold” from the NATRACOM annually.  These six NATRACOM locations include:

CNATRA N7  Flight Training Support Center (FTSC) – NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing One – NAS Meridian, MS
Training Air Wing Two – NAS Kingsville, TX
Training Air Wing Four – NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing Five – NAS Whiting Field, FL
Training Air Wing Six – NAS Pensacola, FL

This effort is to provide direct support for all NATRACOM curricula, courseware, and training materials, centrally managed and maintained by the Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), satisfying the Command’s aviation training requirements within a well timed, efficient, and accurate corporate continuum.  The FTSC is composed of the Operational Support Segment (OSS), which includes Training Integration Management System (TIMS) product development, the Curriculum and Courseware Support Segment (CSS), and the Configuration Management and Quality Control – Support Segment (CM/QC-SS); all Support Segments are dedicated to direct operational/functional training support.  The FTSC Support Segments are critical elements of the NATRACOM training environment and crucial to primary mission objectives.  Present course material is undergoing conversion to Authorware 7.0 with full Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliance.  The Contractor shall deliver to the Government all products, software, author-ware, hardware, documentation, data rights, and operating licenses procured / developed for, or incidental to, this Contract effort.

Contractor activities will include the design, development, Revision and Maintenance (R&M), conversion, testing, documentation, training, delivery of completed product to the government, and establishing and tracking the inter-dependent relationships and operational support of all CNATRA Headquarters and NATRACOM aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials/publications.  This requirement also includes: Instructional System Design (ISD); courseware authoring; technical publication support; program/project management; configuration management and quality control; and data management. 

In addition, the contractor shall provide process-engineering support that is focused on a continuous process improvement that increases the quality of the product and services provided to the CNATRA and NATRACOM customer base.  The selected contractor must be able to comply with Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI)-Level 3.

A critical element of the CNATRA corporate business process, which includes the contract work-force, is effective utilization and implementation of Operational Risk Management (ORM).

Structurally, the NATRACOM and CNATRA staff utilize microcomputer based client server network, hardware, and software to support current and future requirements. All technology services provided must comply with Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) standards established by Naval Network Warfare Command (NETWARCOM). 

	It is anticipated that the contracted effort will take the form of a combination SOO/SOW, with written proposals supported by an oral component.  

           Anticipated contractual milestones are as follows:

•	RFP Release -16Apr07
•	Possible site visits – 7-11May07 
•	Proposals due - 14Jun07 
•	Anticipated award - 1Sep07
•	Anticipated contract start date - 1Oct07

The Government intends to conduct a competitive acquisition under the 8(a) Program per FAR Subpart 19.8.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be a 5-year contract with one (1) base year and four (4) option years with both Fixed Price and Cost contract type elements.  8(a) businesses capable of accomplishing the required effort, within the NAICS code 511210, are invited to submit a statement of interest to include possible teaming/subcontractor arrangements.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to identify potential sources and products capable of enabling the public to receive and utilize NWS essential weather information.  It will allow the NWS to determine the interest of prospective manufacturers in designing, constructing and marketing systems for the reception of the Emergency Managers Weather Information (EMWIN) datastream or for software to make that information more valuable to EMWIN users.  The EMWIN satellite broadcast in its present form through the NOAA Geostationary Orbital Environmental Satellites (GOES) must undergo a change when the new generation of satellites is placed into service sometime on or before 2011.  Existing EMWIN receiving systems must be adapted or replaced to make the transition to the new satellite broadcast. The NWS wishes to identify and inform a community of vendors who have an interest in marketing low cost and reliable products capable of accommodating the transition.  Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government’s need are invited to submit an affirmative response.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including technical information sufficient to permit agency analysis.  This RFI is issued by NWS solely for obtaining information and planning and does not constitute a solicitation.  Proprietary information must not be submitted and will not be accepted by NWS.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.202 (e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Furthermore, no basis for claims against NWS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or NWS’s use of such information.  Affirmative responses should be submitted on via E-Mail to emwin.system@noaa.gov.  No telephone calls please.


BACKGROUND 

What is EMWIN? - The EMWIN system is a popular dissemination system providing a serial bit stream containing timely watches, warnings, forecasts, hydro-meteorological products, graphics and satellite imagery. The EMWIN data stream is prioritized to meet the needs of emergency managers. EMWIN uses NOAA’s GOES satellites and economical receive systems to disseminate and process this bit stream. L-band Satellite broadcast is accomplished via GOES-East and GOES-West and also rebroadcast in Pacific via PeaceSat.  In addition to L-band satellite broadcast, portions of the EMWIN data stream are also rebroadcast via VHF radio, in certain areas, and via the internet in its entirety via internet push technology.  Additional information may be found at  http://www.weather.gov/emwin/index.htm.

EMWIN Satellite Broadcast - The current EMWIN broadcast modulation is Dual Frequency Shift Keying (DFSK) at a user data rate of 9.6 kbps.  The service is transmitted from the GOES satellites using an L-band down-link frequency at 1690.725 MHz.  Additional information may be found at  http://www.weather.gov/emwin/WINSAT.HTM

What must change? - Changes in the next series of GOES satellites, the GOES-N thru P constellation, have necessitated development of a service to be offered as a replacement and upgrade to the existing broadcast.  All current EMWIN users will need to migrate to newer technologies due to frequency, power and modulation changes.  In addition, EMWIN users and vendors have also stressed the importance of increasing the EMWIN data rate and keeping the cost of the GOES-N transition as low as possible.


PREPARATION FOR TRANSITION

EMWIN System Design & Specifications – Working with NESDIS, the NWS has developed a system design and specifications for the use of prospective vendors.   The next generation broadcast, EMWIN-N is a digital direct broadcast service with a frequency of 1692.7MHz.   The broadcast will be offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) modulation and convolutional rate 1/2 plus Reed Solomon forward error correction for additional gain.  The user data rate will be 19.2 kbps.  Details of the design and specification are now available at http://www.weather.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc.
  
Proof-of-Concept Development – To demonstrate the feasibility of a receiving system capable of meeting the new EMWIN system design, NESDIS has developed and constructed a proof-of-concept model system using hardware implementation for the intermediate-frequency (IF) conversion and a software-defined radio scheme for the demodulation.  Detailed information on the proof-of-concept design may be found within the specification at http://www.weather.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc.  It is the intent of NWS to make the Demodulation and Decoding software and the dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that were developed available to the public at no charge.  The software may be downloaded at http://www.weather.gov/emwin/EMWIN-N%20OQPSK%20software.htm. Vendors are free to develop any alternative scheme which meets the system design and specification criteria.

GOES-N Satellite – The proof-of-concept model has been successfully tested using the GOES-N satellite.   The results of these tests are posted on http://www.weather.gov/emwin/transition/EMWINtstReptGOES-N.doc. An EMWIN-N test broadcast may be available via the GOES-N satellite during satellite test periods. The GOES-N satellite is currently in storage until the next test period or until required to replace the generation of GOES satellites still in service.  These older satellites will be replaced by the new generation on or before 2011, depending upon fuel consumption, premature failure or demand for capabilities only present in the new satellites.  Before being placed into operational service, the GOES-N satellite will be activated each year for a test period. Test periods will be announced at http://www.weather.gov/emwin/index.htm.

	   
INVITATION 

E-mails will be used to develop a mailing list to be used by the NWS in disseminating additional information on EMWIN and the GOES satellite evolution.  E-mail responses should include the following information:
1) Brief description of firm and current similar product lines
2) Firm’s URL
3) Any questions
4) Expression of interest in being on a mailing list and possible participation in a forthcoming workshop at Silver Spring, MD.
5) Vendors who market EMWIN related products will be identified on a list of vendors posted on the EMWIN web site but without any endorsement by NWS.   

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES - Additional information on the EMWIN program and transition may be found on the EMWIN website located at http://www.weather.gov/emwin/index.htm.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Alternate Software Pricing Structure Search
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SSA-RFI-031507
<RESPDATE>032507
<ARCHDATE>04092007
<CONTACT>Angie Landis, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-9529, Fax 410-965-9560, Email angie.landis@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration is surveying the market to discover what independent services and/or software products (hereafter referred to as services) are available to aid the SSA in fulfilling the requirements of a study on alternate software pricing structures in the Agency's mainframe z/OS operating environment.  
SSA currently operates six IBM z990 zSeries mainframes at the National Computer Center (NCC) in Baltimore, MD including zAAP processors.  The Agency runs mainframe software products from hundreds of vendors on 26 LPARS.  The Agency requires services from a vendor that is independent from the software products running on its mainframe environment. 
 The Agency intends to study the economic feasibility of changing some software licensing structures to workload license charges (WLC), or sub-capacity pricing, where it is in the best interest of the Government.
IBM developed the Sub-capacity Reporting Tool (SCRT), a software product that records the 4-rolling average usage of some (not all) software, and determines where the software executes.  The output of this tool determines how IBM, and other vendors, invoice customers for WLC or sub-capacity pricing.  IBM offers this tool as a free download to its customers, and the services described in this synopsis require the use of SCRT.  However, SCRT by itself cannot meet SSA's requirements to perform a cost benefit analysis (CBA) of changes to license structures, fails to adequately address current and projected growth estimates, does not allow for independent audits, and lacks the detailed reporting features that some financial decision require.  SSA requires services that exceed the capabilities of the SCRT tool.
SSA requires services that assist in planning for, implementing, monitoring and leveraging WLC, or that document why changing prices structures is not in the best interest of the Agency.  These services will combine information about SSA's licensed software products with an analysis of software utilization.  This analysis will provide near real-time estimates of software charges under a variety of scenarios.  These services will include detailed reports from data derived directly from the mainframe's actual workload usage.  The services will report: Which Variable WLC products are on which mainframes; The simultaneous four-hour rolling averages for each product; and Estimated monthly software charges for PSLC, Full-capacity WLC and Variable WLC.
The services will provide comparative software pricing information for planning purposes.  The services will predicatively report software-pricing metrics so that SSA can make decisions on: Varying hardware and software configurations; Moving LPARs from one machine to another; Moving software between LPARs or machines; Consolidating multiple machines onto another machine; and Upgrading from z990 mainframes to z9 mainframes.
The services will generate daily, month-to-date, and monthly reports in Microsoft Excel format.  As SSA changes hypothetical or real parameters and configurations, the reports will update immediately and be available for review.  The services will provide reports for pricing analysis, consolidation analysis, defined capacity, and LPAR configuration.  Additionally, the reports will allow SSA to audit the SCRT, assist in peak management, simplify invoicing functions, and help manage defined capacity, LPAR configuration and SMF data.
SSA anticipates that both a consulting and software solution will comprise the services.  The consultant must have demonstrated expertise in WLC, IBM software pricing models, other major mainframe software pricing models, LPAR and Parallel Sysplex Capacity Planning, defined capacity, soft capping, and usage pricing with WLC for z/OS and zSeries hardware. 
The vendor must be able to implement the services with no alteration to the mainframe hardware or software configuration, with the exception of installing tools and gathering data.  The vendor must fully implement the services within a 30-day period.  SSA should have the ability to assume the management of the services, independent of the vendor, within 60 days.  The Agency does not foresee any additional requirements from the vendor beyond this 60-day period.
Any firm that feels they have the capability of providing these services must respond, in writing, within 10 days of this notice.  Responses must be specific as to proposed services and must include evidence that the vendor is able to meet the requirements detailed in this synopsis.  Vendors may submit pricing data.  This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  The Government will not award a contract based on responses received; however, SSA will use this information to assess capable sources.  Vendors that believe they can offer services meeting the SSA's requirements should submit information concerning their capabilities.  Detailed responses to each of the above requirements (with substantiating documentation) are required.  SSA will not consider simple marketing information or incomplete responses.  SSA will not consider reference to vendor web sites as a valid response.  Vendor’s shall submit responses electronically and be received by 03/25/2007.  SSA will not accept faxed information.  The size limitation for email attachments is 10 megabytes.  MS Word is the Agency’s standard word processing software.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center is seeking sources to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the applicable electric, water, and wastewater distribution systems at Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR). 
DSCR-Richmond, located in southern Chesterfield County, Virginia, is a Department of Defense installation occupying just over 600 acres with 160 buildings. The mission of the center and its tenant organizations is to support the needs of the military services worldwide.  Support includes the acquisition of material for more than 700,000 items of supply, as well as the maintenance of a wide array of logistics information, technical specifications and data.  The value of material it provides to customers is anticipated to reach the $1.4 billion mark this year.  The Center and its tenant organization employ over 3,000 workers, ranking DSCR-Richmond among the top ten employers in the Richmond metro area.  

DSCR-Richmond Electrical: Dominion Power Company (DPC), formally Virginia Power, is the electrical power supplier for DSCR via two 13.2 kV transmission lines from their Bellwood Substation.  There is a DPC selector switch outside of the substation that determines which of the two feeders will provide primary power to the DSCR.  One single -pole 13.2 kV feeder is tapped off of the incoming line, proceeds to a re-closer circuit protector, and feeds a number of large pad-mounted transformers.  The other incoming feeder connects to a main switching station containing two 13.2 kV circuit breakers and manually operated disconnect switches used for isolation during maintenance of the breakers.  The breakers connect to two outgoing feeders that serve other major portions of the installation.  The distribution system is comprised of a combination of above-ground and underground circuits.  Above-ground circuits consist of approximately 51,300 linear feet of 3-phase, 4/0 AWG primary lines; 5,200 linear feet of 3-phase, secondary lines; and 630 linear feet of single-phase lines.  Under-ground circuits consist of approximately 2,300 linear feet of three-phase, 2/0 AWG primary lines.  The electrical system at DSCR appears to be in reasonably good condition especially since the 1991 upgrade.  
  
DSCR-Richmond Water:  The county of Chesterfield supplies water to DSCR.  The county receives their water from the city of Richmond.  There is one main supply point and an alternate point.  The main 8 inch supply line feeds to a 700,000-gallon ground storage tank.  The alternate water source is a four-inch line from the county.  DSCR has two 250,000 gallon elevated storage tanks in addition to the above mentioned 700,000-gallon concrete ground storage tank.  All three tanks were constructed in 1942.  The distribution system piping totals approximately 97,890 linear feet including mains and service connections all of which are either ductile iron or cast iron.  The bulk of the pipe was refurbished/ replaced in 1988, however approximately 25% remains as installed in 1942.  Pipe sizes range from 2 to 16 inches in diameter.

DSCR-Richmond Wastewater: All domestic wastewater generated on DSCR is transferred to the county of Chesterfield for treatment.  The majority of the wastewater system is a gravity flow system.  In some of the low-lying areas on the fringes of DSCR, wastewater flows to the lift stations where it is pumped into the gravity system.  The wastewater system exits the DSCR through 10-inch lines at two locations.  The two lines exiting the installation combine into a 12-inch line that flows east to a county meter station where the wastewater is measured for billing.  These lines are off DSCR property but DSCR has an easement within which the wastewater lines are installed.  The wastewater collection piping is 1942 vintage, totals approximately 96,000 linear feet including services, and ranges in size from 5 to 12 inches in diameter.  Approximately 70% of the pipe was relined in 1988.  There are 10 lift stations on DSCR ranging in size from 10 gpm to 207 gpm and are considered to be in good condition.  The lift station pumps are relatively small, around 2 hp, with only three of the lift stations being duplex stations and the rest are simplex stations.  
 
The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  

Interested parties are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought including, commercial market information and company information. Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone number and e-mail address; business size and disadvantaged, 8(a) or HUBZone status; corporate affiliations; potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, and or major subcontractor or (prime).

<DESC>Notice of Sources Sought to Provide Health Care Services for a National Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (NMMTP) for World Trade Center (WTC) Rescue, Recovery, and Restoration Responders and Volunteers

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has responsibility for a Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP) for responders and volunteers who were involved in rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations at the WTC site or at the debris handling operations on Staten Island.  This program provides free health care for WTC-related conditions, broadly classified as aerodigestive, mental health, and musculoskeletal.  Most of the estimated 35,000 responders and volunteers live in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area, and services are provided to them by a NYC Consortium of six clinics.  However, there is a need to enhance the services for approximately 3000 people who reside outside of the NYC metropolitan area.  Thus, the purpose of this Notice is to describe the scope of work for this National Program (NP) and to learn of organizations that have the capability and interest to fulfill the need for this group of 3000 people and serve as the National Program Administrator (NPA).

The benefits of monitoring and treatment for medical conditions must apply uniformly to all responders and volunteers regardless of their residence location.  Developing a seamless monitoring and treatment program for responders and volunteers who live in the NYC metropolitan area and for those who reside nationally is a high priority.  For people who live outside of the NYC metropolitan area, their geographical locations often create a challenge to find occupational medicine facilities near to where they reside.  When appropriate facilities are located, they must conduct basic exams in the same manner at those conducted by the clinics in the NYC Consortium. These facilities must also provide copies of exam records to a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (Mt. Sinai) so that the overall MMTP program can be managed. 

Services for the participants outside of the NYC metropolitan area have been provided through multiple organizations and have been limited in many cases to a single screening examination.  The goal is to create a NP that would provide monitoring and treatment services for this group through a national network of appropriate clinics that would be reasonably convenient to them (within a normal driving time for health care).  Monitoring exams are provided every 18 months, and treatment is provided as needed.  Experience to date in the NYC Consortium indicates that about 17% of the participants need ongoing health care for aerodigestive disorders and about 16% for mental health problems.  There have been very few cases of musculoskeletal disorders.

If any new potential national participants were to seek enrollment, they would be administered a standard telephone intake questionnaire by the Mt. Sinai DCC Phone Bank to determine eligibility.  Determination of eligibility for participation is a DCC responsibility.  Eligible people would be referred by encrypted email lists to the NPA that would have responsibility for coordination of monitoring examinations and treatment provided through a network of health care providers.

The NPA would provide the DCC with hard copy monitoring examination charts, along with appropriate HIPAA release forms and a physician-signed letter explaining the exam results for each patient seen in the NMMTP.  The NPA would ensure timely completion of a Patient Information Form and a Healthcare Provider Form for both monitoring and treatment visits.  The content of those forms would be provided to the DCC on a monthly basis.  Additionally, the NPA would complete and submit to the DCC the same monthly reports as the other clinical centers, which summarize the numbers of people examined and treated.

The NPA would provide initial and follow-up examinations.  The content would be the “core” examination (examinations conducted at NYC metropolitan clinics may have additional questionnaire components).  Specifically, for NMMTP examinations, the following components would be performed: a short self-administered medical questionnaire and a physician-administered medical questionnaire and physical examination form (the “short protocol”); pre- and post-brochodilator pulmonary function tests (PFTs); standard blood and urine tests; and chest x-ray for initial examinations.  Immediate, urgent, and final letters would be completed and given or sent to each patient by the examining clinic.  Examinations would be paid for by the NPA using contract funds.  A new Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement (QA/QI) program is currently being created by NYC Consortium.  The lead doctor with the NPA would participate in the program and be responsible for its own QA/QI.

The NPA and the Mt. Sinai DCC would sign a Business Associate Addendum, since new patient data would be shared between the two groups.  The NPA would be responsible for ensuring HIPAA compliance with each of its examining sites.

A representative from the NPA would be a member of the Steering Committee of the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program and attend monthly meetings in NYC.

Information about the MMTP can be found at the following websites:
http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/wtc/
http://www.hhs.gov/wtc/
http://www.wtcexams.org/forms.html

NIOSH is seeking sources capable of providing the Health Care Services as detailed above.  Interested sources are requested to submit limited relevant information on the following qualifications of the organization: (1) Experience: An outline of previous work specific to the requirements listed above; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of those in key positions; and (3) Facilities: Availability and description of facilities and equipment required to provide the required services, including capabilities for electronic data entry and use of web-based encrypted systems. Any other specific and relevant information that would improve the government's consideration and evaluation of the information presented is desirable. 

Your responses will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition mechanism.  Responses to this notice shall include the organization's name, address, point of contact, National Provider Identifier (NPI) if available, and size of business (large, small, small women- owned, etc.).  This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. This is not a request for proposals. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses under this announcement nor otherwise pay for preparing any information sent or the Government's use of the information. Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Please submit the requested information to the attention of the CDC Contracting Officer, David Staudt, by 3 p.m., Friday, April 20, 2007.

<CONTACT>Melissa D Mitchell, 256-955-3699
<DESC>An additional sources sought request is hereby issued to validate the acquisition strategy which was previously published.  The capability statements will be limited to 10 pages and due within 20 days from the date of this synopsis. Any firm who subm itted a capability brief under the original sources sought announcement dated 27 October 2005 need not reply to this announcement unless the firms business status has changed.  This announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from  the small business community in the SMDC SETAC recompetition at the prime contractor level; and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those interested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level.  The capability state ments and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firm or teams ability to perform; that evaluation will be part of the formal source selection process. However, these will be utilized to make final deci sion concerning number and types of reservations.  The Government intends to award seven (7) SETACs.  Further, we are exploring the potential to maximize small business reservation opportunities for the SETAC program.  Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a sm all business reservation contract, PROVIDING THAT EACH TEAM MEMBER MEETS THE NAICS CODE SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD.    The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 1000 employees for this acquisition.   The contractors will be expected to provide non-personal services for systems engineering and technical assistance in support of the Mission and Function Statements for the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Huntsville and Washington DC; Program Ex ecutive Office  Missile and Space; and Other Government Agencies related to air, space, and/or missile defense.  This support is both broad ranging and ever changing.  The current SETAC scope of work (SOW) has ten (10) functional areas:  1) Requirements D efinition, Integration, and Planning; 2) Technology Development, System Development, Assessment, and Validation; 3) Threat Estimation/Projections; 4) Weapons Lethality and Effects Estimation; 5) Modeling, Simulation, and Interfacing; 6) Program/Project Ana lysis, Evaluation, Experimentation, and Support; 7) Production and Fielding Support; 8) Homeland Defense and Homeland Security; 9) Warfighter Support; and 10) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Support. The follow-on acquisition will result in multiple awards with identical SOWs and numbers of Direct Productive Person-Hours (DPPHs).  The contracts will consist of fixed-price labor categories and cost reimbursable travel and materials line items.   The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other  proposing teams).  Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award.  The resultant contracts will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC), Program Executive Office  Missile and Space (PEO-MS), GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE (GMD) JOINT PROGRAM OFFICE (JPO), and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) contracts.  To the greatest extent pos sible, while still protecting the Governments interests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractors actual SETAC performance.  Any SMALL BUSINESS FIRM, including 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled-Veteran-Owned, or Woman-Owned, intending to propose as a PRIME CONTRACTOR (including those planning to use the affiliation and  teami ng rules issued by the SBA) are invited to submit a capability statement to the Government.  Large business requests for capability statement opportunities as a prime contractor are not desired at this time.  Capability presentations must mirror how you pl an to propose.  If proposing as a team, the presentation must reflect the team and team approach. The capability statements will be due within 20 days from the date of this synopsis.  The capability statements should focus on issues that affect the decision as to number/types of small business reservation awards such as:  (1) the breadth and depth of technical and management expertise to successfully execute all SETAC roles, (2) the capability to quickly ramp up qualified and trained personnel at the onset of the contract,  (3) the capability to administer and manage an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, task order contract (expected as a minimum to be $2M per year for the total program) with numerous subcontractors,  (4) assurance and demonstration that the small business firm or small business team will perform 50% of the work,  (5) capability to perform realistic cost and schedule projections for complex technical and integration efforts,  (6) a contract management structure that allows for an integrated organization accountable for total performance responsibility, and  (7) an understanding of Army, DoD, and Government Agencies with whom USASMDC and PEO-M&S interface.   A cover letter must be provided with your submission and must include, as a minimum, identification of the proposed prime contractor and/or Joint Venture; all small business team members; any other subcontractors; and which type(s) of set-aside/reservation  your Company/Team plans to submit a proposal under (i.e., Small Business; 8(a); woman-owned; service disabled veteran owned (SDVO); and/or HUBZone). Firms that can meet requirements set forth above are requested to provide a statement (not to exceed 10 pages) of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions. Capability Statements may be submitted  via mail or hand carry.  Provide one (1) copy in CD form and three (3) copies in paper form no later than 4 April 2007. If mailing, send to the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC), Werner Von Braun Complex, Bldg 5220, SMDC-RDCM- SS, Attn: Melissa Mitchell, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898.  If you desire to hand carry, package can be delivered to Redstone Arsenal, Building 5220, Room 1028, Attn: Melissa Mitchell. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the res ults of the evaluation. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and available at the SMDC Website (http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/SETAC 07.html). It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any synopsis or solicitation. This acquisition is not open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  In order to be considered for award, offerors must possess or be able to obtain a TOP SECRET facility security clearance.

<DESC>This is a Special Notice to inform interested contractors of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento Districts planned Industry Day and subsequent solicitation for an Indefinite-Delivery Requirements Contract for Emergency Levee Repair constru ction work.   This notice invites interested contractors to attend and participate in an Industry Day Meeting on April 5th 2007.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal. The purpose of our Industry Day is to gather input from interested and experienced contractors for the purpose of improving our planned Emergency Levee Repair solicitation.  To facilitate open communication between the Government and contractors, we are ex tending an invitation for contractors to come in individually and meet with a small panel of Government personnel. This panel will include representatives from our Contracting, Engineering, Construction and Emergency Management divisions.  Industry Day mee tings with each interested contractor will be scheduled for approximately one hour each. Please telephone Mr. Eric M. Samuels to schedule a time to come in and meet.  Eric can be reached at (916) 557-5367.  Any early comments/input you wish to provide prio r to your meeting time are appreciated.  You may send your comments to the email addresses below. The government is also interested in any useful ideas and input you wish to provide to help improve our proposed solicitation/contract.  We have provided draft Technical Specifications, Standard Drawings, District Boundary Map, and Pricing Schedule for you r review on FedTeds website.  The following are some of the questions and concerns we are soliciting input: a) How should the contract boundaries be defined.  This determination may directly affect whether we award one, two, or three contracts for Emergency Levee Repair.  We are currently considering the following four possible options for the geographic area of  coverage and number of contract awards within the Sacramento District in the state of California:  - One contract covering all river basins and the delta. (1 contract) - One contract for the Sacramento river basin, one contract for the San Joaquin river basin   and one contract for the Delta Island region. (3 contracts) - One contract for north of I-80 and one contract for south of I-80 (2 contracts) - One contract for work north of I-80 and Hwy 50, one contract for the Delta area  South of I-80 & Hwy 50 and north of I-580, I-205 & Hwy 120) and one contract for work  South of I-580, I-205 & Hwy 120. (3 contracts) b) Are the items included in the pricing schedule adequate to cover expected emergency levee repair work?  Is the unit of measure for each item appropriate?  c) Are there any comments or suggestions regarding the draft plans and specifications?   d) Is an economic price adjustment suggested considering the 5-year total maximum contract period, or does the contractor have sufficient confidence that they can adequately price line items for the 4 option years? If you are unavailable to come in and meet with us, we still encourage you to provide any written comments or suggestions on our approach to the upcoming solicitation.  Any input received will be evaluated and considered for possible incorporation into the  solicitation.  Written comments should be emailed to the email addresses provided below.

(vi)	The Statement of Work for this requirement is provided as Attachment 3 to this combined synopsis/solicitation. 
(vii)	Delivery and acceptance of deliverables will be FOB destination.   Delivery requirements for all line items will be stated on individual delivery orders.  
(viii)	The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this solicitation. 
(ix) 	The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible firm(s) with the lowest priced technically acceptable (LPTA) quote based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for noncost factors: technical capability and past performance.  In order to allow the Government to determine technical acceptability, the offer shall submit the quantities of product samples of paperboard and trap to USDA, APHIS, PPQ, Building 1398, Otis ANGB, MA 02542 as indicated under Section F. and G. of the Statement of Work by the time specified below for receipt of offers.  The following technical capability factors shall be used to evaluate offers and the offeror’s product must meet each category to be technically acceptable : (1) Traps are of the Gypsy moth design; (2) All traps are fabricated of hard sized, liquid packaging grade ½ gallon milk carton paperboard stock .024 inch nominal thickness and polyethylene plastic-coated on both sides.  Variance from nominal thickness is no greater than +.002. 3.  (3) Adhesive is distributed as specified, completely covering area when traps are separated from each other with minimum manipulation of the traps.  (4) Traps with adhesive will weigh 10 grams +/- 1 gram more than blank traps. (5) The size, cutting, perforating, and precreasing is in accordance with the schematic drawing provided.  (6) The plastic coating is not damaged by the precreasing. (7) The trap outside surface is of green, orange or brown color.  (8) The printing is waterproof, visible through the adhesive coating and unaffected by the adhesive coating. (9) The adhesive shall be applied in a manner within dotted lines of the designated area as shown in the attached diagram, and applied in a manner which prevents disposition outside of the designated adhesive area, so when folded the adhesive stays within the adhesive panels only. (10) Each trap is prepared for storage, folded in a manner that aligns the inside surfaces to prevent the adhesive coated surfaces from contacting non-adhesive surfaces.  (11) The quality of the paperboard must meet industry standard milk carton grade or equivalent and must not leak exhibiting good liquid holdout capability, especially where edges and cuts are exposed.  This is measured by a “paperboard test” which tests the sample paperboard against an international paperboard standard. The test is as follows:  Paperboard is cut into identical pieces and weighed to get the dry weight.  The pieces are then put into a water bath of 22.2 centigrade for one hour.  The pieces are removed and blotted dry and weighed to measure the wet weight. The dry weight is subtracted from the wet weight and the amount is divided by the wet weight and multiplied by 100 which give the percent of water absorbed.  The industry standard range of weight for water absorption should be 1.5% – 2%, and the percent of water absorbed in the sample paperboard should be equal to or less than the industry standard or not greater than 10% of the standard.    Additional guidance on price and past performance is provided under provision 52.212-1. 
(x) 	The provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation. The contractor shall return a completed copy of this provision with its quotation. A copy of the provision may be attained from http:// www.arnet.gov/far.

MDA will hold an Industry Day to discuss the new Missile Defense Agency Engineering and Support Services (MiDAESS) acquisition on Wednesday, 28 March 2007.  The conference is scheduled from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM CDT (Note:  Registration begins at 8:00 AM) at the Huntsville Marriott, 5 Tranquility Base, Huntsville, AL 35805 (phone number (256) 830-2222).  Attendance is limited to three (3) representatives per company and pre-conference registration is required.  Use the registration form located at http://www.fedbizopps.gov and submit in accordance with the directions.  Registration will be available through close of business 5:00 PM CDT, 26 March 2007.  Late registrations will be accepted only on a space availability basis.  The Government is not liable for any expenses incurred by an attendee or eventual offeror in order to attend this conference.  This meeting is not open to foreign firm participation at either the prime or subcontract level.  The primary purpose of this conference is to involve industry in the acquisition strategy planning process before MDA makes any final decisions.  The agenda includes:  a brief discussion of the Agency?s recent reengineering effort and resulting new organization structure; overview of current engineering and support service contracts and issues associated with transitioning to a new contract vehicle; preliminary review of technical requirements; discussion of key planning issues (e.g. regulatory and organizational constraints), alternative approaches (pro/con); plan of action and milestones; and next steps in the acquisition planning process.  To help facilitate full and open industry participation, MDA has asked Mr. Stan Soloway, President, Professional Services Council (PSC), to act as a conduit for industry questions/issues or recommendations (soloway@pscouncil.org).  PSC is a government services industry advocate who promotes government and contractor communication and collaboration.  Participation with PSC is strictly voluntary and your company is not required to be a member of PSC.  Industry may also may also submit questions/issues or recommendations directly to the MDA Contracting Officer, Janice Olson, by email (MiDAESS@mda.mil).  Please use the Question and Recommendation Forms located at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to submit questions/issues or recommendations.  Identify if your question contains proprietary information.  All questions and responses will be published.  Company names and proprietary information will be removed from the questions prior to publication.  Questions should be submitted no later than COB, 23 Mar 07 to be incorporated into Industry Day.  However, industry may submit questions/issues or recommendations any time thereafter.

MDA anticipates awarding multiple contracts no later than the first quarter of calendar year 2008.  This procurement will use a mixture of set-aside and full and open competition procedures.  Contract places of performance are primarily Huntsville, AL, National Capitol Region; as well as other potential MDA areas of operation such as, but not limited to, Colorado Springs, CO; Albuquerque, NM; Los Angeles, CA; and Ft. Greely, AK. Teaming arrangements and joint ventures are encouraged.  Firms responding should indicate on the registration form whether they are a large business, small business, an 8(a) firm, a HUBZone small business, a veteran owned small business, a service disabled veteran small business, a historically black college or university, woman-owned business, or a minority institution. 

Any resulting contracts will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful offeror from participating in any other MDA contracts.  All personnel will require a minimum of a Secret clearance, Completed National Agency Check (NAC), or have submitted for a NAC in order to use government information systems and/or to access certain MDA unclassified information at contract award.  Access to classified information requires either a final or interim clearance at the appropriate level.  Some effort will require personnel with a TOP SECRET clearance at contract award.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firm participation at either the prime or subcontract level.  

MDA will subsequently post a draft RFP, and any other draft documents/information on the FedBizOpps (FBO) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov, including updates.  The draft RFP, HQ0006-07-R-0012, will be released on or about 17 May 2007.  All prospective offerors interested in submitting a proposal must have a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all contractors wishing to do business with the Department of Defense must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in order to receive a contract award from any DOD activity.  CCR registration can be accomplished at the following website: www.ccr.gov.  Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive email notification when information, solicitation and any amendments and future documents regarding this acquisition are issued and available for downloading.  MDA will not directly send offerors the solicitation or any amendments.  It is the interested offerors? responsibility to periodically check this website for updates.
 
This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

MDA appointed Dr Patricia Sanders, Executive Director, as the Ombudsman.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate serious concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Dr Sanders is available to hear the concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Potential offerors should communicate first with the Contracting Officer to request information, pose a question, and voice concerns before contacting the Ombudsman.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Ship Propulsion and Power Systems
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research and Naval Sea Systems Command are issuing a Request for Information (RFI) and scheduling an Industry Workshop to fulfill the requirements set forth below.     The Chief of Naval Operations has directed the Naval Sea Systems Command to evaluate the Navy need for emerging Integrated Power System technologies and to guide the development and transition of technology to the fleet.     The Navy has developed and is in the process of deploying first generation Integrated Power Systems (IPS) on numerous ships classes.     Systems include full electric propulsion, such as DDG 1000 and T-AKE, partial electric propulsion, such as LHD-8, and mechanical propulsion ships with innovative electric mission systems such as CVN 78 and SSN 23.     The Navy is in the process of issuing contracts to four shipbuilders who will work interactively to evaluate the Navy?s open system architecture for the Next Generation Integrated Power System (NGIPS) and provide recommendations to maximize opportunities for common component development.     The shipbuilders will use the findings of the NGIPS Navy Working Groups and work under the Alternate Nuclear Power System (ANPS) to build upon the Navy?s architecture.       The contractor(s) will recommend changes to the Navy?s NGIPS technical architecture consisting of a functional description of a platform-independent system of power and propulsion modules suitable for application to the following Navy ship types, a surface combatant, a submarine, an expeditionary warfare ship, an aircraft carrier, and a littoral combat ship. Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command (COMNAVSEA), has chartered a Next Generation IPS (NGIPS) Flag Level Steering Board to provide guidance and oversight for NGIPS to support transformational warfighting through improved Integrated Power System technology while ensuring system commonality and the enabling of electric weapons and sensors.     This Flag board has directed that industry ?buy-in? should be obtained for next generation IPS technical architectures and technology options.     The purpose of the Peer Review Team Workshop described below is to obtain industry and equipment supplier input to development of options for the Next Generation Integrated Power Systems technical architecture development.     The Office of Naval Research is gathering and evaluating information regarding current technologies and equipment, and research and development efforts underway having shipboard propulsion and power implications. Key areas of interest are energy conversion, electric propulsion, power conversion, power generation, power distribution and energy storage. This announcement requests non-proprietary concepts and data for systems and equipment that can populate Integrated Power and Weapon Systems alternative architectures.         This undertaking is expected to serve as part of the foundation for developing a roadmap for U.S. Navy propulsion power and energy science and technology and research and development. 
     
We request industry leaders and innovators across the spectrum to provide non-proprietary survey information for systems/equipment you are operating, manufacturing, or developing which could benefit the NGIPS ship technical architecture development as described.     Responses to this request for information should be submitted by March 26 in the form of a short 1-2 page white paper.     Opportunity for submission of specific proprietary information will be discussed at the workshop.
         
In addition to this request for a response for technical information, a Peer Review Team Workshop will be held on April 5-6, 2007, to allow all interested contractors, HM&E and combat system integrators and university representatives to respond to Navy-led briefings and discussions     and provide input to these NGIPS technical architecture studies in breakout sessions.     Many briefings to be presented at this event will be considered to fall under export control and     Distribution Statement "D" (Critical Technology) restrictions. Therefore only Department of Defense (DoD) and DoD contractor personnel who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents are authorized to attend.     The Navy?s desire is to obtain input from system integration firms and organizations possessing advanced component technology.     Any other U.S. requests shall be referred to the point of contact below.       Additional workshop information is provided below.     
     
This NGIPS Peer Review Team Workshop is scheduled for 5 and 6 April 2006 and will commence at 1200 hrs on April 5 and end at 1400 hrs on April 6.     This schedule is intended to follow the Sea-Air-Space Exposition 2007, which ends on April 5.     The location for this event is:         Alion Science and Technology Office, 1100 New Jersey Ave, SE, Washington, DC 20003.
     
Submittals:       Please fax or e mail your survey responses by March 30 to the POC noted below. Information provided in response to this RFI shall be non proprietary.     For Industry Day attendees, please call POC below to RSVP.     Please RSVP no later than 26 March, 2007. The Point of Contact for both Survey and NGIPS Peer Review Team Workshop RSVP is:     Mr. Larry Kneessi, Alion Science and Technology, Phone 571-227-6944,     Fax 571-227-6300, E-mail: kneesss@onr.navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>--Emergency Levee Repair Industry Day Special Notice
<DESC>This is a Special Notice to inform interested contractors of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento Districts planned Industry Day and subsequent solicitation for an Indefinite-Delivery Requirements Contract for Emergency Levee Repair constru ction work.   This notice invites interested contractors to attend and participate in an Industry Day Meeting on April 5th 2007.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal. The purpose of our Industry Day is to gather input from interested and experienced contractors for the purpose of improving our planned Emergency Levee Repair solicitation.  To facilitate open communication between the Government and contractors, we are ex tending an invitation for contractors to come in individually and meet with a small panel of Government personnel. This panel will include representatives from our Contracting, Engineering, Construction and Emergency Management divisions.  Industry Day mee tings with each interested contractor will be scheduled for approximately one hour each. Please telephone Mr. Eric M. Samuels to schedule a time to come in and meet.  Eric can be reached at (916) 557-5367.  Any early comments/input you wish to provide prio r to your meeting time are appreciated.  You may send your comments to the email addresses below. The government is also interested in any useful ideas and input you wish to provide to help improve our proposed solicitation/contract.  We have provided draft Technical Specifications, Standard Drawings, District Boundary Map, and Pricing Schedule for you r review on FedTeds website.  The following are some of the questions and concerns we are soliciting input: a) How should the contract boundaries be defined.  This determination may directly affect whether we award one, two, or three contracts for Emergency Levee Repair.  We are currently considering the following four possible options for the geographic area of  coverage and number of contract awards within the Sacramento District in the state of California:  - One contract covering all river basins and the delta. (1 contract) - One contract for the Sacramento river basin, one contract for the San Joaquin river basin   and one contract for the Delta Island region. (3 contracts) - One contract for north of I-80 and one contract for south of I-80 (2 contracts) - One contract for work north of I-80 and Hwy 50, one contract for the Delta area  South of I-80 & Hwy 50 and north of I-580, I-205 & Hwy 120) and one contract for work  South of I-580, I-205 & Hwy 120. (3 contracts) b) Are the items included in the pricing schedule adequate to cover expected emergency levee repair work?  Is the unit of measure for each item appropriate?  c) Are there any comments or suggestions regarding the draft plans and specifications?   d) Is an economic price adjustment suggested considering the 5-year total maximum contract period, or does the contractor have sufficient confidence that they can adequately price line items for the 4 option years? If you are unavailable to come in and meet with us, we still encourage you to provide any written comments or suggestions on our approach to the upcoming solicitation.  Any input received will be evaluated and considered for possible incorporation into the  solicitation.  Written comments should be emailed to the email addresses provided below.

<SUBJECT>--On-Site Well Monitoring and Analysis at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) located in Hanover, NH
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), Vicksburg Consolidated Contracting Office proposes to issue a sole source contract to Eastern Analytical Inc of Concord, New Hampshire (who has performed all well testing and analysis at CRREL and maintains the base line data) to provide the following service: Currently the monitoring wells at CRREL are sampled using a modified 3 well volume purge procedure.  Spe cifically, a Grundfos pump is used to purge ~ 50 L from the well and then to collect a sample from the well.  This modified procedure was adapted because of the slow recharge in some of the CRREL wells. However, this procedure is not well standardized and leads to concerns about the comparability of the sampling events. Because the Grundfos pump is known to generate heat that is typically transferred to the samples, there are also concerns whether this pump can recover representative concentrations of VOCs.   Therefore, this project will compare the VOC concentrations in samples collected from all of CRREL's ground water monitoring wells using the currently used protocol, low-flow purging and sampling, and PDB samplers. All the samples will be analyzed for th e NHDES full list of VOCs.  Samples will be collected following standard sampling techniques and protocols (e.g. US EPA (1 985)Practical Guide for Ground Water Sampling and US EPA (1986)RCRA Ground Water Monitoring: Draft Technical Guidance).  Specifically , only certified pre-cleaned VOA vials will be used, and all samples will be preserved with (hydrochloric) acid (to a pH of 2) and kept on ice prior to and during shipment to the laboratory. The laboratory will keep the samples refrigerated at 4°C and all analyses will be completed within a 14-day holding time.  In an effort to save on the cost of this evaluation, this project will be conducted in conjunction with the normal sampling regime at CRREL.  Specifically, the three sampling methods will be used to  collect samples from CRREL's ground water monitoring wells (CECRL07 through CECRL20) in July (only).  The five Production wells CECRL0I through CECRL05 and the storm water drain outfall will be sampled quarterly in April, July, October, and January 2008.  Samples from the production wells and the storm water drain will be taken as they have in the past.  The contractor must be a New Hampshire accredited full service laboratory and will conduct all sampling and analyses. The contractor will also supply all the sampling (VOA) vials and equipment needed for the low-flow sampling (including dedicated bladder pumps, tubing, and a controller) and the PDB samplers (including lines and weights) for all of the ground water monitoring wells (i.e., CECRL07 through CEC RL20).  For the conventional sampling protocol, CRREL will provide the Grundfos pumps, tubing, and controller for the monitoring wells.   All sampling schedules and protocols will be approved by the Government and coordinated with the CRREL Safety and Envi ronmental Management Office.  The contractor shall furnish the test results and analysis to the CRREL Safety and Environmental Management. Office within 10 business days of collecting the last samples.  All samples from the same well will be analyzed on th e same day.   A firm fixed-price contract will be awarded utilizing the Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Any other responsible source able to provide the services stated above is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 15 calendar days after i ts publication.  This is not a request for quotations and there is no solicitation available at this time.  POC for this announcement is Lou Ann Duffy at 601-646-4280 or by email at lou.ann.duffy@erdc.usace.army.mil.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
Inverted Domestic Corporation.  A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held. 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a U.S. Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 

MARCENT was provided Dell Server 1850 platforms by MarCorSysCom and the MCNOSC which were centrally procured as the part of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) Forest Consolidation and Hardware refresh during 2006.  Dell servers will accept memory devices from other manufacturers, but Dell will not work on the system while the third party hardware is installed in the server. If an issue arises for which MARCENT G-6 has to contact Dell for warranty service, Dell will instruct them to remove “all” third party hardware before continuing.  Furthermore, if any damage is caused by the third party hardware, Dell can and may refuse warranty service on either the portion damaged or the entire server platform thus requiring additional warranty or hardware be re-purchased to cover losses. The third party memory will require a separate warranty be tracked specifically for the memory chips provided by that manufacturer adding unneeded complexity to the server platform administrators.  By purchasing Dell memory the current warranty for these platforms will remain in effect.  In order to keep current operations going at MARCENT and reduce the risk of warranty violations, it is requested that Dell 4 GB module for Power Edge 1850 server be purchase.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Title of Project: HIV/AIDS Faith-based Forum Project


I.   Background and Need – 
It has been more than 25 years since the first U.S. diagnosed case of AIDS.  Although efforts have been made to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in the U.S., Americans continue to be affected by increasing HIV/AIDS prevalence rates.   The African American community – more than any other racial or ethnic group - has been severely impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  Even though African Americans comprise only 13 percent of the U.S. population, they accounted for half of the new HIV/AIDS cases diagnosed (in 33 states) and more than half of the people who have died from AIDS.

Over the last year The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has conducted a host of activities as a part of our heightened response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in African American communities.  The Division of HIV /AIDS (DHAP) seeks to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS by tapping the expertise of various sectors, including the faith community and its leadership, to mobilize broader community action; increase opportunities for diagnosing and testing HIV; improve program services; and prevent HIV infections through effective interventions.  The CDC has long recognized the essential role that the faith community plays in influencing knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors relating to health. As a result of a faith-based consultation completed by DHAP in 2006, CDC found that faith leaders expressed a strong desire for education to help them address HIV/AIDS effectively so that they may play an important role in efforts to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community.

The HIV/AIDS Faith-based Forum Project is a vehicle through which, faith leaders from African American faith denominations shall acquire and develop the skills to better raise awareness about the impact of HIV/AIDS on African Americans, and to develop ways to inform and inspire their peers and congregants to increase HIV prevention. 

II.  Project Objective – The objectives of the HIV/AIDS Faith-based Forum Project are to:

•	Disseminate prevention messages regarding benefits of early HIV testing, prevention, and care;

•	Address the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS by promoting open dialogue about the disease, and support for those persons living with HIV and AIDS; and

•	Increase the ability of faith leaders to promote HIV prevention awareness within their congregations and communities.

The HIV/AIDS faith-based forum(s) shall allow participants to engage in panel discussions about ways to break the silence about HIV/AIDS, challenge stigma, and promote HIV testing and diagnosis in African American churches as a means of reducing HIV/AIDS in African American communities.  HIV/AIDS faith-based forum participants shall discuss ways they, as African American faith leaders, can encourage care and compassion for people living with HIV/AIDS.

The guaranteed minimum order quantity resulting from this solicitation will be a tar getry package including some combination of the items listed above with a contract value of $200,000.00.

Ordering periods are as follows: ORDERING PERIOD 1, DATE OF A WARD  30 SEP 2007; ORDERING PERIOD 2, 01 OCTOBER 2007  30 SEP 2008; ORDERING PERIOD 3, 01 OCTOBER 2008  30 SEP 2009.

CAUTION: This synopsis/solicitation i s posted electronically to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website at http://www.fbo.gov under number W52H09-07-T-TARG and any amendments will be issued electronically via the same website. The Government is under no obligation to maintain a  respondent list and it is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access FedBizOps site to obtain any amendments which may be issued. This solicitation is issued using simplified acquisition procedures, pursuant to FAR Part 13, as authorized by the test program, at FAR part 13.500. FAR clauses 52.212-1 through 52.212-5 (and as modified herein) are incorporated by reference. Responses are requested for this solicitation, and will result in a three-year, IDIQ contract for wireless MTs , TMs, HHCs, and Battery Chargers for use at GTA, Germany. Offerors are advised to propose their best price for these items as described in the Statement of Work, Attachment 001 (hereafter SOW). Attachment 001 (and any subsequently mentioned attachments) c an be found on TACOM-Rock Islands Solicitation Information Page, URL: https://aais.ria.army.mil/aais/SOLINFO/index.htm under Draft Solicitations/Specifications/Scopes of Work.). In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certificat ions  Commercial Items, Nov 2006, the offeror shall complete Attachment 002 and submit along with their offer, completing only paragraph (k) if they have completed the annual representations and certificates electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov  and para graphs (b) through (j) if they have not. The successful offeror must quote devices already granted Host Nation (HN)  in this case, Germany  approval. If an offerors equipment has HN approval, the offeror will have corresponding J/F-12 (Joint Frequency A llocation Process) number(s) on file.

This information mu st be submitted with the offerors completed Pricing Sheet, referenced hereafter as Attachment 003. Following award, the successful offeror shall request a frequency assignment from the Grafenwoehr Frequency Manager, with contact information to be listed i n the award narrative.  The awardee is also responsible for obtaining any other necessary licenses or permits required by law or statute to execute the provisio ns of the resulting contract. FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items (Jan 2006), applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference with the following modifications: subsection (a) is tailored as follows: The NAICS code is 3329 and the small business size standard for this acquisition is 500. FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition, modified as follows at subsection (a): The Government will award a contract resulting from  this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price and Technical Capability  of the offered item to meet the Governments requirement. Items offered will be considered Technically Capable if they satisfy the requirements of HN approval outlined above. In the event that more than one Technically Acceptable offer is received, the Go vernment will award to the offeror with the lowest total evaluated price of MTs, TMs, HHCs, Batteries, and installation/training. Offerors shall enter prices for each item on Attachment 003. The quantities set forth on Attachment 003 are estimates, for pri cing purposes only, and do not bind the Government in any way. The total evaluated price will be the sum of the weighted evaluation price for all Ordering Periods, where the weighted evaluation prices are calculated by multiplying the proposed unit prices for each range and Ordering Period by their respective weight and maximum quantity, and summing their totals. Pricing Sheet Quantity ranges for Battery Chargers mirror those of the TMs, to meet the requirement of potentially needing to charge all batteries  (one for each TM) simultaneously. However, the offeror may quote multi-station battery chargers that satisfy this requirement. For example, if a TM quantity range is listed as 10-20, the offeror may quote two (2) 10-station chargers in lieu of twenty (20)  single unit chargers, as long as this is noted on the offerors completed Pricing Sheet.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical questions submitted against RFP Number N00173-07-R-RS02.

Question 1:  Is there a limit attached to how much of the work must be done by the Small Business Prime?  Typically in the past we have seen a number like 51%.  Answer 1: The prime contractor must perform the majority of the effort, specifically, more than 50% of the proposed effort. Question 2:  Which UAV system is anticipated by the Navy?   Is there an interface control document (ICD) that shows the interfaces of the imaging system to the UAV?  This will directly impact the design of the system.
Answer 2:  The Navy has not determined which UAV platform will be used with this system.  No Interface Control Document (ICD) is available. The Offeror will identify the UAV platform or platforms that are functionally and operationally compatible with their proposed system.  Specifically, the proposed system will meet all specifications when it is integrated with the suggested platform or platforms. Any UAV suggested as a potential operating platform shall conform to the constraints associated with the airborne portion of the proposed system, as stated in the specifications, and shall, when combined with the proposed Coastal Hyperspectral Imager, provide a fully functional, fully operational, and fully integrated system capable of operating on its own and meeting all specifications that are not dependent of operation on the platform.  Question 3:  With regard to Solicitation N00173-07-R-RS02, is it correct to assume that the “Total Small Business”  set aside precludes a non-small business from any participation in the activity, even as a sub to a small business prime?  Answer 3: The assumption is incorrect.  See Answer 1, above.  Question 4: Please provide the following information on any incumbent: Contractor name, Contract number, Award Date, Maximum Value.  Answer 4: No incumbent information is available.  This action represents a first-time buy.

<DESC>Questions to RFP: NPV8G17033AS01

1. With regard to subject solicitation, could you please advise if the use of US Citizens is required to perform the work under this contract.
	Answer: YES

2. I have retrieved 4 documents from FEDTEDS. I do not find any documents requiring sample translations; do you not wish to see sample translations? 
	Answer: NO 

3. Your spreadsheet lists the languages you want us to price; do you want only one standard price, or rates for standard, rush and economy?
	Answer: Please submit your prices

4. Is there any special set-aside for small businesses or woman-owned businesses in this solicitation?
	Answer: NO

5. Do we need to send you a notification that we will be bidding on this solicitation?
	Answer: Please do

6. The SOW states: "Symbols that are unique to the maritime community will be retained in the original configuration and placed in the corresponding location within the translated text. All graphs will be retained and the translation of all words related to the text will be provided." In addition, it also states: "All Foreign Notice to Mariners, that require translation will be provided to the Contractor in either hardcopy or softcopy format.  

 If the GFM's are delivered to us in a hardcopy format or in an in-editable softcopy format (i.e.: PDF), we will have to literally build the graphs from scratch in order to lay out the English wording in their corresponding location. Furthermore, if these GFM's are indeed in-editable by virtue of being hardcopies or PDF's (for example), we will have to build and layout the entire document from scratch. Your RFQ makes no allowance for that (design or graphic services, etc.) in its Excel sheet, as it only requests a per-word quote for the translation. Should we factor in the cost and time of graphic design/layout, etc. in the per word quote per language?
Please explain.

	Answer: The source required for translation will be in hard copy format, specifically Sailing Directions Volumes. When a graph is embedded in the text, the graph will be scanned and the corresponding translated text added to the graph.  This cost should be incorporated into your quote.

7.  Will the Requestor provide a Glossary of Terms or any similar document of specific terminology or frequently used words or expressions?

	Answer:  No glossary of terms or frequently used words available for this solicitation.

<DESC>Amendment #1 hereby cancels RFP1006.  This cancellation is due to a change in the Statement of Work.  It is in the best interest of the Government to cancel this solicitation and reissue once the changes have been finalized.  The changes are due to a wide variety of prospective contractor?s questions that support that RFP1006 is unclear and not in line with what the Government is requesting.  Cancellation of RFP1006 also cancels the site visit scheduled for March 21, 2007.  Reissue of the RFP is estimated to be within the next 2 weeks from date of cancellation.

<DESC>The SEC intends to establish one contract vehicle which encompasses the SEC's CFMS requirements; however, subcontracting and/or teaming are encouraged in a manner which is transparent to the Government.  The SEC reserves the right to make single or multiple awards for these services, as well as the right to make no award pursuant to this RFP. In the event of multiple awards for these services, multiple awards will not be made in a manner that encompasses both tasks.  A separate award may be made for Project No. 1 - Child Development Center (CDC) and Project No. 2 - Commission-Wide Program to Replace And/Or Upgrade Office Furniture.  The intent is to contract with one vendor to manage the entire CFMS process; however, multiple awards may be considered to manage Project 1 and Project 2 independently.

<DESC>RFQ Title: Interment Flags Request for Quote (RFQ) #: VA-101-07-RQ-0179 is hereby amended to answer additional questions submitted in response to the solicitation. The time and date specified for receipt of offers is not extended by reason of this modification.  Questions &amp; Answers Question 1: In the first paragraph, the Amendment refers to &quot;Offerors who submitted responses to RFQ#VA-101-07-RQ-0048?&quot;  Does that refer to VA-101-06-RQ-0048 Amendment 009 or is it something else? Response: This refers to RFQ VA-101-06-RQ-0048. Question 2: The amendment states that &quot;Offerors who have not successfully previously provided Interment Flags to the Department shall include a bid sample . . .&quot; Does that mean no sample is required from an offeror who HAS successfully previously provided Interment Flags to the Department? Response: Yes. Question 3: Further, the amendment states that in the Technical Quote offerors must address their ability to manufacture the flags as specified, including but not limited to: personnel, training, equipment, manufacturing process, etc. Are previous suppliers required to submit all of that detailed information or is that only for offerors who have not previously provided Interment Flags to the Department? Response: ALL offerors shall address their ability to manufacture the flags as specified, including but not limited to: personnel, training, equipment, manufacturing process, etc. While not required, to limit redundancy we have authorized offerors to resubmit the technical quotes provided under RFQ VA-101-06-RQ-0048 as long as the capacity increase required by this solicitation is clearly addressed in the technical quote submission.  Question 4: Do offerors who have successfully previously provided Interment Flags to the Department need to address the question posed in the amendment as to why they believe they are compliant with the public law (PL-105-261 section 1073), the non-manufacturer rule, etc.? Response: Yes. While not required, to limit redundancy we have authorized offerors to resubmit the technical quotes provided under RFQ VA-101-06-RQ-0048 as long as the capacity increase required by this solicitation is clearly addressed in the technical quote submission.  Question 5: The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance as follows: technical capability, past performance and price.  Technical capability, the most important, is being evaluated based on results of the bid sample, technical criterion identified in item 6 and past performance.  If a previously successful offeror does not provide a bid sample, then how is this factor evaluated? Response: To have successfully performed this requirement for the Department in the past, the flags submitted would have conformed to the specification identified. As such, Contractors that are not required to submit a bid sample will receive a technically acceptable rating under the bid sample portion of the technical evaluation. Question 6: Since we had successfully previously provided Interment Flags to the Department, we provided a previous contract number.  Should we be providing additional technical reference information to supplement that or is having previously provided under a contract sufficient? Response: If you are confident in the performance provided to the Department under the contract identified, that single listing is sufficient. Question 7: It appears in Amendment 04 you basically now are asking the same questions that you asked on the main bid VA-101-06-RQ-0048 for Interment Flags. My question would be that I would incorporate those answers for ...0048 into a supplement to ....0179 and send them electronically to you referring now to the Amendment 04 of bid ...0179. Is that acceptable? Response: Quote submissions shall adequately address the requirements established in the solicitation. A contractor may amend/incorporate changes into the submissions provided under VA-101-06-RQ-0048 at their discretion. Question 8: It also appears in Amendment 04 for ...0179 that you are no longer looking for a contractor that can do the entire amount by giving a minimum quantity of 10,000 flags to 172,014. Response: The Department retains the immediate need for 172,014 Interment Flags. 10,000 flags shall be the contract minimum per IDIQ contract awarded and is not reflective of the monthly need of the Department. Contractors shall propose monthly quantities of Interment Flags for which they have the capacity to provide. The monthly requirement based on 6 flags per carton is 28,668 flags per month for the first five months and 28,674 flags in the sixth and final month. As indicated in the solicitation, the government reserves the right to make multiple awards. Pricing shall be reflective of the quantity each offeror has identified themselves as being capable of providing. Question 9: Amendment 4 states that the "contract minimum shall be 10,000 Interment Flags and the contract maximum shall be 172,014"&#160;&#160; Can you clarify if this is 10,000 per month minimum or can someone bid on 10,000 total.&#160; Response: 10,000 flags shall be the contract minimum per IDIQ contract awarded and is not reflective of the monthly need of the Department. Contractors shall propose monthly quantities of Interment Flags for which they have the capacity to provide. Question 10: Will bid samples be accepted before the March 21, 2007 deadline? Response: Yes. Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the solicitation document remain unchanged and in full force.
