<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland intends to negotiate and award a purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures under FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.501 (a) with Blaze Science Industries, LLC in Lawndale, CA for the purchase of Ginsenoside Calibration Solutions.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 325199, and the size standard is 500.</p>
<p>The National Research Council (NRC) Canada has isolated and characterized these commercial solutions as part of a National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements effort to develop an infrastructure to support dietary supplement analysis. The solutions purity was assessed by NRC Canada and they supply the isolated and characterized solutions directly to Blaze Science Industries, LLC for distribution. Blaze Science Industries, LLC is the only supplier of the isolated and characterized solutions at this time.</p>
<p>The isolation of the solutions and their subsequent characterization by NRC Canada puts these solutions on a higher plane of traceability than other commercially available solutions and the purchase of these solutions directly from Blaze Science Industries, LLC shall allow NIST immediate use as NIST shall require no further testing upon receipt as they shall have already been isolated and characterized by NRC Canada before being supplied directly to Blaze Science Industries, LLC.</p>
<p>As a result, Blaze Science Industries, LLC is uniquely qualified to satisfy this requirement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by May 24, 2010 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Acquisition Management Division (AMD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the Metallurgy Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc. (HTTA) of Pleasanton, CA, for a service agreement for a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and associated components, manufactured by Hitachi.

The NIST/ Metallurgy Division has the mission of promoting U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness in the development and use of materials by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology.  The Division has a field-emission scanning electron microscope, a Hitachi S4700-II, which is used to investigate materials in its research programs such as advanced on-chip interconnects, semiconductor nanowires, and thin film and other nano-structured materials. 

The FESEM requires periodic preventive maintenance to enable the instrument to perform to specification.  Moreover, due to the instrument's high usage level, certain components may exhibit wear or even breakage necessitating component replacement.  FESEM instrument downtime would have detrimental impact not only on the research activities of the Metallurgy Division, but on the other Divisions within the MSEL.  

The Contractor shall provide a service agreement for the service and maintenance of the FESEM and its associated components to ensure uninterrupted performance within manufacturers’ specifications on both a scheduled and as-needed basis.  NIST requires that the service contract utilize original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts/components for FESEM.  

Service and maintenance shall include parts, labor, travel, unlimited on-site emergency 
service, and one preventive maintenance visit per year.  

Sole source determination is based on the following:
The FESEM is manufactured by Hitachi, and Hitachi High Technologies America is Hitachi's authorized representative. Hitachi has no other authorized service representatives within the United States, therefore, only HHTA can supply the required parts and guarantee that the maintenance and parts will be fully compatible with, and meet the original performance specifications for this FESEM instrument.

A potential source would have to possess proprietary knowledge of the Hitachi equipment.  No other vendor possesses the knowledge to provide the required service and maintenance. No other vendor has rights to Hitachi’s proprietary hardware and software. Hitachi has no distributors.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219 and the size standard is $6.5 M. 

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by May 28, 2010, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation announcement only. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement is currently available. Requests for the same will be disregarded.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: A solicitation 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business is being considered by the Government. However, no formal acquisition strategy decision has been made at this time.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance of the program would begin upon contract award in the forth quarter of FY 2009 and run for a five (5) to six (6) month period. It is envisioned that a contract would be established at time of initial award allowing five (5) additional option periods in the contract. Four of the options would run for twelve (12) with the final option period lasting six (6) to seven (7) months. The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of all options would be from time of contract award through 5 years.<br /><br />Any resulting solicitation will call for a Contractor to design, develop, and implement a Warrior Wellness Program addressing the following:</p>
<p>Mentorship Program: Develop confidence in hospitalized, but stable casualties and their families by increasing recuperation process awareness and hope in the future through long-term positive relationships with mentors of similar injuries.</p>
<p>Wellness: Increase the wounded warrior's, families', and hospital staff's awareness of existing quality of life programs through distribution of information and by collaborating with medical treatment facility therapy centers.</p>
<p>Community Outreach: Educate community leaders, businesses, and civic organizations where casualties transition on specific interests and needs of returning wounded warriors to establish a solid foundation for casualty's reintegration into the community.</p>

<p>The overall performance objectives include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Severely injured casualties and families verbalize a greater understanding of the recovery "way-ahead" and demonstrate improved recovery rate due to mentor support.</p>
<p>b. Greater casualty involvement in outside activities that have been facilitated through Warrior Wellness Program.</p>
<p>c. A recognized decrease in unemployment rate of casualties leaving military service.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a solicitation within the next thirty (30) days for a Warrior Wellness Program to improve the Special Operations Wounded Warrior recovery outcome by early introduction of casualty mentors and providing awareness regarding motivating activities available that boost their confidence and self esteem to better compete for wounded warrior friendly employment opportunities developed through community outreach and employment network development.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation announcement only. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement is currently available. Requests for the same will be disregarded.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: A solicitation 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business is being considered by the Government. However, no formal acquisition strategy decision has been made at this time.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance of the program would begin upon contract award in the forth quarter of FY 2009 and run for a twelve month period. It is envisioned that a contract would be established at time of initial award allowing four (4) additional option periods in the contract. The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of all options would be from time of contract award through five (5) years.<br /><br />Any resulting solicitation will call for a Contractor to design, develop, and implement a Warrior Wellness Program addressing the following:</p>
<p>Mentorship Program: Develop confidence in hospitalized, but stable casualties and their families by increasing recuperation process awareness and hope in the future through long-term positive relationships with mentors of similar injuries.</p>
<p>Wellness: Increase the wounded warrior's, families', and hospital staff's awareness of existing quality of life programs through distribution of information and by collaborating with medical treatment facility therapy centers.</p>
<p>Community Outreach: Educate community leaders, businesses, and civic organizations where casualties transition on specific interests and needs of returning wounded warriors to establish a solid foundation for casualty's reintegration into the community.</p>
<p>Resource Networks: Develop a community resource network to capitalize on the success of the mentorship, wellness, and community outreach programs. The Contractor shall also provide access to employment opportunities and community resources further enhancing the special operations wounded warrior's recovery outcome.</p>
<p>Operational Health Advanced Training Program: Provide a program to improve the physical and mental abilities of the wounded warriors returning to active duty with personalized military/tactical performance training in order to give them additional tools to succeed within the military environment.</p>
<p>Advocacy: Educate wounded warriors on available benefits/resources, and interact with Government agencies on their behalf in order to optimize their benefits.</p>
<p>The overall performance objectives include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Severely injured casualties and families verbalize a greater understanding of the recovery "way-ahead" and demonstrate improved recovery rate due to mentor support.</p>
<p>b. Greater casualty involvement in outside activities that have been facilitated through Warrior Wellness Program.</p>
<p>c. A recognized decrease in unemployment rate of casualties leaving military service.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the ability to provide support identified at various locations within the United States as directed by the Government. However, it is anticipated that the primary place of performance will be at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington D.C. The secondary place of performance is anticipated to be Brooke Army Medical Center located at Fort Sam Houston, TX.</p>
<p>Potential sources must possess an active Facility Clearance (FCL) or be eligible to obtain an FCL at the SECRET level.</p>
<p>This procurement is 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business. <br />Questions concerning this pre-solicitation announcement may be directed to Contracting Officer Dr Joseph R Daum, email daumj@socom.mil phone 813-282-8795 ext.6110.</p>
