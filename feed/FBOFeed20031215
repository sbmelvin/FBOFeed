Proposals will be evaluated on lump sum bid price for the base item and evaluation of price on any options that is most advantageous to the Government.  Award of any options items may be made by modification to the contract and, if exercised, would be awarded when funds become available during the term of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award a contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT BY RESULTS NATIONAL CONTRACTING SERVICE FOR ARCHITECTURAL & ENGINEERING, CONSTRUCTION, & DESIGN-BUILD SERVICES The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is reopening the RESULTS National Qualified Vendors List (NQVL) to all interested facility design and construction vendors, including those currently qualified under the NQVL.  This action is in direct response to the ‚ÄúProject Performance‚Äù initiative of the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Terminal Business Unit (ATB) under the broad umbrella of the ATO Chief Operations Officer (COO) performance based initiatives. Interested firms must meet at least one of the three following criteria: A.  Core business is that of providing architectural & engineering (A&E) design services. B.  Core business is that of providing construction services. C.  Core business is that of providing design-build services. FAA is seeking national, regional, and local vendors with demonstrated high performance and verifiable customer references in one or more of the above noted fields.  It is contemplated that separate QVL‚Äôs will be established, under the umbrella of the RESULTS NQVL, for each of the three construction related areas.  Construction in this context is defined as any or all activities directly relating to the design, build, and quality inspection and acceptance of National Aerospace Systems facilities (buildings). These QVL‚Äôs will be distinct from the current RESULTS NQVL in that all performance based design and/or construction related projects, identified by the ATB, will utilize one or more of these specialty QVL‚Äôs when seeking proposals and making selections for contract award.  In addition, all vendors will be required to agree to and undergo a performance based bar-coding process as prescribed by Arizona State University‚Äôs Performance Based Studies and Research Group (ASU/PBSRG).  This system is referred to as the Performance Information Procurement System (PIPS). Interested firms determined to have met the requirements addressed in this announcement for the initial phase must also attend a one-day PIPS workshop at Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, on January 13, 2004.  Details on the workshop will be provided at a later date. The creation of these QVLs will use a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the announcement of the requirement in order to permit firms an opportunity to express an interest and demonstrate that they meet at least one or more of the criteria specified in paragraphs A., B., and/or C. above.  Only those firms responding to this announcement, and who are determined to have met the criteria, will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The FAA reserves the right to no longer consider firms that fail to respond, firms which respond incompletely, or firms which respond with any information found to be verifiably false.  Details of the remaining phase(s) of the QVL process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this public announcement.  At a minimum, in order to be considered for future specific projects, qualified firms will be required to:  (1) Attend a PIPS workshop; (2) Undergo the PIPS barcoding process; and, (3) Agree to the terms of the RESULTS Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).  An information copy of the BOA (i.e., BOA Signature Page, BOA Table of Contents, BOA Terms and Conditions, and Attachments #s 1-4) is attached.  Do not call or respond to the BOA at this time. Interested firms, who can comply with and meet the requirements addressed in this announcement, should respond by January 6, 2004, by completing the attached Business Declaration Form (Attachment #5).  The Business Declaration Form must be submitted under separate cover letter, using business letterhead, with an affirmative statement as to which of the three previously stated criteria your firm meets.  In addition, include the name, address, phone and facsimile numbers, and e-mail address of the person to be contacted for future information regarding this effort.  Only these two documents, limited to one (1) page each, will be considered. All responses to this announcement must be in writing and directed to the following address: Federal Aviation Administration RESULTS National Contracting Service, AML-50 Attn:  A&E, Construction, & Design-Build QVLs 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard Oklahoma City, OK  73169 Facsimiles (405 954-5073) and e-mails john.a.lippe@faa.gov are acceptable.  Telephone inquiries and requests will not be accepted, as firms must provide the specified 2-page written documentation in order to be further considered for these QVL‚Äôs.

I.  	SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:   The Senior Program Officer will supervise a staff of two FSN employees.  
J.  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Based on a recent management review of USAID operations in East Timor, USAID/Jakarta decided to establish a Senior Program Officer position in USAID/East Timor.  This decision, in part was due to the unexpected transfer of the Senior Development Advisor to Iraq and the realization that as the East Timor program moves toward independent mission status, with an AID Representative reporting directly to USAID/Washington, the need for a full time Program Officer is necessary.  Previous assistance from the Program Office in Jakarta needs to be replaced with a full time officer; resident in East Timor, to address the various programming and budgetary needs of this growing mission.  
K.  BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION
The Program Office of Dili, East Timor, a two-member unit, is responsible for strategy development, policy formulation, performance reporting, programming/budgeting of resources, project design and management, and public outreach to implement the country program responding to requests from USAID/Washington, the State Department, and the Government of East Timor and USAID's partners. It serves as staff to the AID Representative and prepares special briefings and itineraries for senior visitors from outside the Mission. The work is high volume, fast paced, and highly critical to the overall reputation of the Mission. It carries out a variety of analytic, reporting and program tasks and produces high quality products within a short time frame. Staff members have to be flexible, able to work under pressure, personally responsible for the quality of their work and effective team members. 
L.  STATEMENT OF DUTIES AND SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES
The Senior Program Officer's primary responsibility will be to serve as the senior advisor to the USAID Representative on all program matters.  Duties will include:

1.  	Lead the drafting, editing, and finalization of key mission-wide strategic planning and reporting documents, including the annual Congressional Budget Justification, the Annual Report, and Mission input into the Asia/Near East Bureau Program and Budget Submission (BPBS).  In this capacity, s/he will review technical office input and provide editorial and programmatic guidance in response.
2. 	Organize a series of annual two day meetings on the principal sectors in which the Mission is active; i.e., economic growth and governance, trade and investment, health, and democracy promotion. These meetings will assemble representatives from all the key actors in these sectors, including the host country governments, other donors, and other partners (e.g., non-governmental organizations and private voluntary organizations). The purpose of these meetings will be to: develop an inventory of all ongoing and proposed donor- and host-country funded activities in each sector; assess and discuss which of these planned approaches are best undertaken bilaterally and which are best undertaken by multilateral organizations; and develop an initial estimate of the major results to be achieved in each sector over the next three years.
3.	Based on the results of these meetings, lead the development of annual USAID/East Timor action plan review for each sector. These plans will specify: which USAID/East Timor entities and partners are to undertake which activities; what results are to be achieved by those activities; and what human and financial resources are required to achieve those results.
4.	Serve as USAID/East Timor's monitoring and evaluation specialist, assuming primary responsibility for all monitoring and evaluation aspects of the mission's portfolio, including customer service information and the development of performance monitoring plans for all programs managed by USAID/East Timor. In this capacity, s/he will work in close collaboration with technical offices both in USAID/Washington and USAID/East Timor itself. 
5.

<RESPDATE>022504
<ARCHDATE>12142004
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for up to four (4) pasture facilities to maintain wild horses.  The facilities must be located in one of the following states:  Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri or Iowa.  The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility:  BACKGROUND - a.  Wild horses and burros on public lands administered by BLM and Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the December 15, 1971 Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331-1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt-A-Horse program.  Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land.  The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain up to four (4) facilities, each to initially pasture a maximum of 2,200 (plus or minus) mares and/or a maximum of 2,200 (plus or minus) geldings.  b. The BLM started the implementation of the Wild Horse and Burro program's strategic plan "Living Legends in Balance with the Land."  This plan will be removing more animals than the BLM has facility space to maintain and continuing to gather animals to active Approbate Management Levels on the Public Lands.  During the first years of this contract, the majority of the horses will be younger, adoptable animals.  These animals will be received and shipped from the facility year round.  Because of the large number of animals being removed from public lands, there is an excess of adoptable animals.  These animals will be kept in a pasture setting while they are maintained at this facility.  All stallions over the age of 6 years will be gelded and the younger stallions will not be gelded.  c. Older horses may be shipped into the facility during the first years, but will be increasing as the contract continues.  The horses maintained for long term will be a non-reproductive herd consisting primarily of older horses in the age range of 6-30 years old. d. Each contract will hold either geldings or mares, unless a facility is capable of holding both, with proper separation.  For the long-term holding, all the stallions will be gelded and there should be no stallions in the herd.  For the mares long-term holding, some of the mares may be in foal.  All foals will be removed from the facility after they are weaned.  As horses die, they may not be replaced with additional horses.  Therefore, the number of horses may decline during the period of the contracts.  OBJECTIVES - a. To maintain excess wild horses on private land in pastures that are large enough to allow free-roaming behavior and can provide the food, water and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in good condition.  b. In the long-term holding, to minimize to the extent possible handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates and corrals.  c. To provide pasture and semi-free roaming behavior in the younger, more adoptable animals, until they are shipped to an adoption.  d. To provide humane care during receiving, holding, preparing and shipment of horses.  e. To provide regular on-the-ground observation of the wild horses to ascertain their well being and safety.  f. To provide management by individuals that are knowledgeable and experienced with regards to the behavior and nutritional requirements of equine and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desirable forage plants.  This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210.  This solicitation will be available on or about January 12, 2004.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided.  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a Sole Source contract for services under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA).  A Justification and Approval of Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared.  This procurement is for the services of NEMA, which administers the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC).  EMAC is an agreement among member states to help one another respond to and recover from disasters and is coordinated by NEMA.  FEMA desires to better integrate EMAC and its coordination activities with the Federal response to disasters.  EMAC is essential to the coordination role that FEMA fulfills during disasters, because EMAC is the broker for resources (including labor) amongst member states on behalf of other impacted member states.  The acquisition of these services will better enable FEMA to administer the provision of essential emergency services required for public health or safety and protection of property resulting from hazard.  The acquisition of a contract vehicle, such as an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract will better enable FEMA to administer the provision of essential emergency services required for public health or safety and the protection of property resulting from disaster.  NEMA is the only known source for the disaster related tasks.  NEMA has existing and needed resources, organization, capabilities, and contacts among State Governments to coordinate disaster resources among States.  This notice of intent is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing, by mail, fax or email to Mr. David Murphy not later than 12 Noon on January 2, 2004.  The contact information is as follows:  MAIL: FEMA 500 C Street, SW, Room 350, Washington, DC 20472; FAX: 202-646-3846; EMAIL: David.Murphy@fema.gov.  Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Cassandra Miller, Contract Specialist, Phone (301)227-7817, Fax (301)227-1461, Email millecal@nima.mil
<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), formerly the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), intends to modify the period of performance of the existing Computer To Plate (CTP) three-year maintenance support contract, NMA100-01-C-0002, with Blanchard Systems Incorporated (BSI), New Orleans, LA.  The intent is to extend the contract for one (1) additional year and include a one-year option period at a total estimated cost of $2,227,743. The CTP is a NGA critical system that provides Commercial Off-the Shelf (COTS) based capabilities to scan and archive the reproduction material (repromat) used to support NGA printing operations and to process the digital repromat to create printing plates.  The goals of the CTP are to create a filmless or non-photographic prepress production process and to eliminate the traditional prepress task of manual negative engraving and photo lab work.  The CTP provides the digital repromat to other NGA production systems, all military commands, and foreign co-producers.  At a high level, the CTP performs the following functions:  scanning, digital image assembly, color proofing, and image setting, in addition to the support functions of file archiving and production management. Currently, the CTP is in the process of transitioning server and archive functions to the Gateway Data Center. Increasing requests for digital production demands a new strategy for network efficiency and long-term file storage.  For this reason, CTP is teaming with the Gateway Data Center and physically moving the Server operations and Archive database.  The conclusion of this integration will benefit the NGA mission by providing customers direct access to CTP produced digital files, and securing a more reliable information archive.  This transition involves physically removing the Server and transferring 15 Terabytes.  Any critical malfunction could render the production system unusable, and destroy the information archive. The CTP integration and support requires approximately 18 months system specific experience and a Top Secret accreditation both of which BSI possesses.  CTP represents the only bridge between all customer digital files and the printing press.  Any interruption or degradation of CTP has an immediate impact to Warfighters.  NGA plans in the next twelve months to transition the responsibilities of the CTP to the agency's contract that provides for the infrastructure and information service support of NGA.  The extended period of performance will guarantee uninterrupted system support and continuity of operations while transitioning server and archive functions.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested parties have three (3) days from the date of publication of this Synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact clear and convincing evidence of their qualifications and/or capabilities.  Such qualifications and/or capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses received after three (3) days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to this synopsis and will not be considered.  A determination by the Government to either conduct or not conduct this effort as a full-and-open competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All inquiries must be submitted in writing to the address or facsimile number stated herein to the attention of Cassandra Miller, Contract Specialist, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), 4600 Sangamore Road, Bethesda, MD 20816, millecal@nima.mil.  Responses to this notice must be received by close of business, E.S.T., December 18, 2003.  Responses must include your business name, point of contact, address, and telephone number with area code.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  Responses may be faxed to (301) 227-1461.  If no responses are received, a modification will be issued to Blanchard Systems Incorporated (BSI).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is issuing a DRAFT solicitation for Technical and Management Support (TAMS).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330 with a size standard of $23.0 million. The Draft solicitation is being issued for Informational Purposes Only. No proposals are being requested or accepted under this notice or the Draft solicitation document. The Draft solicitation is available for downloading on the DOE Interactive Industry Procurement System (IIPS) located at the following internet address: http://e-center.doe.gov. If you need technical assistance in registering with IIPS, downloading the Draft solicitation, or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or email the Help Desk at IIPS-HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees. This support contract will provide planning, program management, and communications support to NETL?s Federal project managers, product managers, policy analysts, public affairs officer, and researchers.  This support will be primarily of a general nature, providing reviews and analyses of existing data and continuing ongoing tasks to provide assistance to NETL program and project areas.  As part of this support, the contractor will assist NETL personnel in planning programs, administrating programs and projects consistent with and in response to NETL-management and DOE/HQ direction, and communicating with stakeholders and the general public. These support services will be provided to NETL personnel at four locations in Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, Tulsa, OK, and Alaska.  It is expected that the core support personnel will be employed by a small business and that these personnel will primarily consist of qualified scientists, engineers, energy analysts, and public affairs specialists.  Most of the support personnel will physically be located at NETL sites, but the support contract will include provisions for short-term, off-site efforts when these are justified by cost, staff, or timing considerations. The contract to provide these technical and management support services will be performance-based.  The contract will include measurable performance standards that  will assure the timely performance of services or delivery of reports. Contract performance will be encouraged by incentives (e.g., award fee) and measured according to a performance evaluation plan. NETL has initiated an electronic reading room as part of the strategy to provide information that may benefit potential offerors in preparing their proposals.  The information is provided to assist the reader in gaining an enhanced understanding of the requirement.  The reading rooms are under construction and changes should be expected throughout this process and up to the issuance of the solicitation.  The reading rooms may be accessed at http://www.netl.doe.gov/business/solicit/ssc2003/index.html . A FOIA release version of the current contract has been posted to the electronic reading room.  Offerors requesting a FOIA copy of the current contract will be directed to the reading room to download it from that location.  Summary information, including the estimated range of dollar value, estimated FTE?s, and anticipated type of contract are posted to the electronic reading room. It is anticipated that the formal TAMS solicitation will be available for downloading from the IIPS Internet page in February 2004. Questions relating to the solicitation are required to be submitted electronically through the question submittal option of the IIPS program. ONLY those questions posted to the IIPS program will be accepted.  All responses to solicitation questions will be released on the IIPS Internet page.  The solicitation will only be made available in IIPS.  This is an electronic solicitation therefore no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be made available. At this Internet site you will be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to download the solicitation, join the mailing list for the solicitation, and to submit a proposal.  If you need technical assistance in registering or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or email the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov.

<DESC>This sources sought announcement initially posted 19 Nov 02 under the auspices of market research is hereby modified to formally advertise Solicitation No. MDA412-03-R-0002 scheduled for electronic release on this website on or about 28 Feb 03.  The solicitation will seek offers under commercially negotiated best value source selection procedures in response to the Department of Defense Dependents Schools-Europe (DoDDS-E) Heidelberg School Maintenance Program 2003 contract initiative for the acquisition of comprehensive maintenance and custodial support services for over 100 facilities and accompanying grounds strategically located throughout the Heidelberg, Bavaria, Kaiserslautern, Mediterranean, and Isles districts.  Contract type will be a task order driven Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity arrangement manifesting a cost profile ranging from $280,000,000 to $340,000,000 with a guaranteed minimum amount to be disclosed at time of solicitation issuance.  Contract award is tentatively scheduled for 01 Jul 03 subsequently encompassing a base year, 4 one-year option periods, 1 three-year award term period, and a final two-year award term period aggregating to a maximum contract performance period of 10 years.  Immediately available for phase-in will be up to 26 facilities operated under jurisdictional authority of the Heidelberg district.  Remaining districts will be activated for phase-in on an optional basis at government discretion pending examination of award results and time frames necessary for appropriate transition from other contractual obligations.  It should be noted it is the government's express intent to award a single contract integrating both maintenance and custodial support services with proviso a multiple award scenario may be considered.  In the event multiple awards do materialize, the government will not award a contract at any level lower than an entire district.  Major evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be past performance weighted at 35%, management at 35%, and technical at 30%, the combination of all non-cost related factors being slightly more important than price.  This contract initiative represents a true performance-based services approach whereby in response to a solicitation generated statement of objectives tasks will be performed in accordance with a contractor-authored statement of work, other applicable contract terms and conditions, and performance metrics firmly established by industry standards.  At time of initial screening of proposals the government reserves the right to limit competition to the most highly competitive offerors from which award will ultimately be achieved via the conduct of oral presentations.  Concurrently, this will not preclude the contracting officer from awarding on initial offers without the conduct of discussions if doing so is deemed to be in the best interest of the government.  Level of competition for this procurement is unrestricted.  Once the solicitation is made available for download it will be the responsibility of competing offerors to monitor the website for release of applicable amendments or other related information.  All interested sources possessing the necessary resources and proven capability to perform a requirement of this magnitude are encouraged to submit an offer that will be considered.  FedBizOpps registrants interested in this acquisition are requested to email the below point of contact to ensure compilation of a complete and accurate competitor database.

The procurement will be a sole source to Northrop Grumman Systems, 600 Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL  60008-1098.  The AN/TPQ-36 FireFinder radar system is a mobile, phased array rad ar system that automatically locates hostile mortar and artillery projectiles.  Northrop Grumman is the designer of the AN/TPQ-36(V)8 and the only source that has produced and delivered this system to the Army.  The Government possesses only a general syst em performance specification and there are no Level III detailed drawings or specifications that would enable another source to replicate the form, fit, or function of the radar system.  Northrop Grumman is the sole developer and producer of this shelter a nd is the only contractor possessing the expertise and technical knowledge qualifying it as a responsible source.  Therefore, a modification will be awarded to Northrop Grumman to exercise option year 3, and additional efforts above, on contract DAAB07-02- C-H302 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2409√Ç¬©(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) Only One Responsible Source.

<CONTACT>Kenneth  Kitahara, (703) 695-2563
<DESC>NA Amendment #2 to RFP W74V8H-04-R-1121:  The RFP is hereby amended to include the following information to assist in the preparation and submission of offers. Question 1:  Could you provide us with the company name and point of contact of the contractor that conducted the high level spend analysis and identified service commodity categories, as mentioned in the solicitation? Answer.  Booz Allen & Hamilton, POC Mr Reid Jackson 703-377-4292 Question 2:  The SOW indicates that the contractor will be tasked with formatting and normalizing √¢¬Ä¬òraw government furnished acquisition data.√¢¬Ä¬ô   What data sources does DoD envision providing?  If DD350 data is to be provided, will it be from FY02  or FY03? Answer. DoD will attempt to extract as much data as possible from the Army and Air Force Business Intelligence Systems (BIS) in an attempt to gather as much information as possible down to the contract line item level.  Both BIS systems are in the developm ental stages but appear to offer significantly improved data for contracts contained therein. Data extracted will not account for all purchases within the commodity group but will provide additional information for those contracts that are available in the  BIS systems.  Also, BIS data will probably only be available for FY03 and perhaps only a portion of FY03.  The Navy is working towards utilizing either the Army or Air Force BIS software to extract Navy data.   Question 3:  Are there any programs/initiatives that the strategic sourcing Concept of Operations should align with? Answer. The DoD DP&AP Acquisition Domain enterprise spend analysis initiative under the Business Management Modernization Program. Question 4:  Do you have any guidance document on the Concept of Operations? Answer.  None.   Question 5:  Section d. of the Statement of Work indicates that the contractor should √¢¬Ä¬òformat and normalize raw government furnished acquisition data ...√¢¬Ä¬ô What sources/types of data does DoD plan to provide? Based on our previous experience, the presence of line-item or commodity detail reflecting the products and services purchased by the agency is important to ensuring that the sourcing strategies and resulting contracts accurately reflect spend for a particular commodity. What is the extent of DoD's ability to provide spend data at a more granular level (e.g. DFAS, Purchase Order) than that available through the DD350? Answer.  DoD will attempt to extract as much data as possible from the Army and Air Force Business Intelligence Systems (BIS) in an attempt to gather as much information as possible down to the contract line item level.  Both BIS systems are in the develop mental stages but appear to offer significantly improved data for contracts contained therein. Data extracted will not account for all purchases within the commodity group but will provide additional information for those contracts that are available in th e BIS systems.  Also, BIS data will probably only be available for FY03 and perhaps only a portion of FY03.  The Navy is working towards utilizing either the Army or Air Force BIS software to extract Navy data. Question 6: How much of the budget is under consideration for the spend analysis?  Answer:  The previously published questions and answers contain the commodity areas under consideration.  The entire DD350 data for FY02 for the entire services area is approximately $40 billion.   Question 7: How is the procurement spend data currently accumulated?  Answer:  DoD does not have a centralized spend data collection √¢¬Ä¬òsystem√¢¬Ä¬ô beyond the DD350 data.  We are working on the development of a department wide capability to extract spend information from business intelligence systems and/or contract writ ing systems but it is in the formative stages. Question 8: What type and level of assistance can we expect from the DOD organization? Answer:  The commodity teams will consist of government employees who will  be expected to perform the analytical and decision making functions.  The intent of the task √¢¬Ä¬òb√¢¬Ä¬ô in the contract contract statement of work is to secure a company who can provide an individual to oversee, guide and facilitate the commodity teams .  The commodity teams are expected to learn from the contractor's experience how to accomplish spend analysis so that DoD does not depend upon contractor support in the out years.  Our goal is to learn how to establish and run successful commodity teams.  We intend to establish teams in a sequential manner and would prefer that the same person facilitate each team so that a common format is established.   Question 9:  Will the contractor be conflicted out of future business by performing under this contract? Answer:  Contractors who perform services similar to those under analysis may find that they are conflicted out of future business.  A firm determination cannot be made at this time for any particular commodity area as the requirements of the future contra cts and the level of support provided under this contract will determine whether a conflict exists or not.      Question 10:  What NAICS code will be assigned to the procurement process that would qualify small disadvantaged businesses as subcontractors with large primes? Answer:  The NAIC code is 541611($6 Million).  This is a total small business set-aside competition.  No award will be made to a large business. Express mail is required for prompt delivery of proposals.  Use of regular mail will result in a 2-3 week delay in delivery due to current security screening.  Hand delivery of proposals will require entry through the Pentagon√¢¬Ä¬ôs Metro entrance whereas  the courier will go through a security screening into a waiting room.  Upon arrival, please use the facility telephones to call Ken Kitahara at (703) 695-2563 for pickup and a receipt.  Proposals are due NLT 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, 22 Dec 03.  La te proposals will not be accepted after the designated time.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS). The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described below. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement would be 541710 "Oceanographic research and development laboratories or services".  MMS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received. Based on the review of the responses to this RFI, the MMS may issue a small business set aside or full and open competitive requirement for Capability Statements and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP). However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against MMS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the MMS use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirements. MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this RFI.  NOTE: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern.  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY: The proposed study would collect current and hydrographic measurements in the eastern Gulf in water depth over 1,500 m that will allow identification of processes present in the region and help design future oceanographic studies.  Specific objectives of this study are 1) to conduct a survey of deepwater currents in the eastern Gulf of Mexico using moorings to increase the MMS database in this region; 2) to improve our understanding of the regional oceanography which will help in design future studies, assist calculation of horizontal and vertical trajectories of release oil and its dispersion, and 3) provide an oceanographic framework to help with interpretation of biological observations. The total performance period of this study is estimated at about four (4) years including an 18-month field work task.  Methodology will require the deployment of three deepwater moorings along a line across the Lloyd Ridge lease area at selected depths capable of sample the water column to provide sufficient resolution.  Hydrographic data will be collected during the deployment, servicing, and recovery cruises.  A proven data management plan will be needed to ensure high quality data, lines of custody, archival, distribution, and submittal to accepted data repositories.  Collected data will be interpreted and synthesized with other existing data and knowledge of the Gulf of Mexico to develop narrative discussions which identify physical processes and descriptions of circulation patterns. The project will use ancillary remote sensing data to aid the interpretation and analysis of data collected.  Publication of findings in peer reviewed scientific literature is essential.  Descriptions of similar studies previously conducted by MMS can be found at: http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/ongoing_studies/gom-po.html.   SOURCES SOUGHT: Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 20 pages that details the small business firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above. Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting oceanographic projects of similar scope and complexity and publication record in peer reviewed scientific journals.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. RESPONSES ARE DUE no later than 3:00 pm Eastern Time on December 30, 2003. Please submit three (3) copies of your response to the attention of: Anna Brown, Contracting Officer, Procurement Operations Branch, Minerals Management Service, and if using regular U.S. mail - MS 2500, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170.; or if hand delivered or using a courier service - 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170.  Please include with your questions your full name, the RFI number (33100) & title (Survey of Deepwater Currents in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico), your organization name, complete address, and phone and fax numbers.  PHONE CALLS ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to conduct market research and to invite interested offerors to submit capability statements to the work described in this synopsis announcement. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) developed standards for evidential breath alcohol test devices in the early 1970s, and began testing commercially available devices against those standards to create a qualified products list of devices meeting the standards. Those standards evolved into model specifications (guidelines) for evidential breath testers and NHTSA continues to maintain a Conforming Products List (CPL) of devices meeting the guidelines. Additionally, NHTSA has developed model specifications and CPLs for Alcohol Screening Devices (ASDs) and Calibrating Units (CUs) for evidential breath testers. Many states have incorporated NHTSA's model specifications and CPLs into their state-level rules, thereby using them to establish minimum performance requirements for devices used to support the enforcement and adjudication of DWI laws. The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (VNTSC) is currently supporting NHTSA's Alcohol Countermeasure Laboratory program.  The general requirements for this Alcohol Countermeasure laboratory program are to conduct the required testing to maintain the Conforming Products List (CPLs) for evidential breath testers (EBTs), Alcohol Screening Devices (ASDs), and Calibrating Units for EBTs (CUs for EBTs).  For the evidential breath testers (EBTs), the test shall be conducted in accordance with Federal Register announcement, 58 FR 48705, published, September 17, 1993.  The Alcohol Screening Devices shall be evaluated and tested in accordance to the model specifications outlined in Federal Register announcement, 59 FR 39382, published, August 2, 1994.  To evaluate and test calibrating units for evidential breath testers, the model specifications can be found in Federal Register announcement, 62 FR 43416, posted, August 13, 1997 (copies of the Federal Register notices are available in the public domain at  www.access.gpo.gov/nara or may be obtained from the above point of contacts). In addition, interested offerors would be required to assist NHTSA's development of new model specifications and their associated testing requirements; conduct bi-annual blood proficiency test program; work with national groups; support the Office of the Secretary of Transportation's workplace alcohol testing program in the various modes of transportation; and maintain basic laboratory capabilities. The written response must include detailed information relating to all the testing being requested. Expressions of interest without sufficient detail to permit evaluation of one's ability to conduct the necessary testing will not be considered. Also, in order to ensure that interested offerors have the capability to perform the required testing in accordance with the model specifications, NHTSA may require the offeror to demonstrate their capability at their own expense. This announcement is not a request for competitive proposals nor is it a vehicle by which to request a solicitation. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether there are other potential offerors capable of performing said work. In the absence of responses from interested offerors demonstrating their capability, NHTSA will conclude that there are no other offerors capable of performing said work. The listed procuring office must receive responses to this source of sought announcement within 45 days from the date of publication.

For 2003 RiderCourse Information: 1-800-466-9227; E-mail: www.msf-usa.org 

FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES:  

The Industryís motorcycle-loan program for rider education is the single most important ingredient for the success of a community rider-training program.  Motorcycles are needed to provide students with actual riding experience.  The loan system allows training sponsors to offer a course to new riders who donít yet have a motorcycle. ©  

To be eligible for loan motorcycles, a rider-training program must first be recognized as a sponsor by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.  Upon acceptance they are given a unique Rider Education Recognition Program (RERP) identification number.  When applying for loan motorcycles the sponsor uses a special loan-agreement form developed by the participating motorcycle manufactures/distributors and the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.   Each manufacturer/distributor has its own policies, procedures and incentives for loaning bikes.  Two incentives common to all are additional dealer discounts and price protection. ©  

In addition to the manufacturer/distributorís financial incentives, participation in the loan program enhances the dealerís reputation and standing as a leader in the community. ©  

In a survey of rider-training graduates, the Motorcycle Safety Foundation learned:  The brand of motorcycle purchased tends to reflect the type of loan motorcycle used at the course.  The major method for learning about the course is through word of mouth, advertisements and dealer referrals.  25% of the beginning students and 13% of the experienced students purchase a motorcycle after taking the course.  The greatest majority of purchases are street bikes.  The course is usually a major influence on the purchaserís decision to by a motorcycle. ©

<SUBJECT>F -- Request For Information - HAZMART Services
<DESC>Request for Information for a Head Quarters Pacific Air Force (PACAF) Strategic Planning Function associated with managing Hazardous Materials Pharmacies (HAZMART) Facilities at multiple PACAF sites.


1.0	SUBJECT

Request for Information (RFI) and sources sought inquiry for HAZMART service providers and information regarding the commerciality of HAZMART services.  Responses are due for this RFI by 4:00 PM HST on January 15, 2004.  See section 6.0 for further information.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  



2.0	DESCRIPTION

HQ/PACAF is seeking information from industry that will assist in a strategic planning initiative associated with Hazardous Materials Pharmacies in various PACAF sites.  (Examples only:  Hickam AFB (HI), Eielson AFB (AK), Kadena AFB (Okinawa), Elmendorf AFB (AK), Osan AFB (ROK), Kunsan AFB (ROK), Andersen AFB, (Guam), Misawa AFB (Japan), and Yokota (Japan).)  

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

∑	Identification of sources and interested parties
∑	Feasibility alternatives assessments
∑	Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing HAZMART
∑	Approximate cost information (i.e. order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives
∑	Commerciality questionnaire associated with HAZMART facilities and services



3.0	REQUIREMENTS


The purpose of the HAZMART is to provide Air Force installations with a standard way of
managing hazardous material (HAZMAT) procurement, use and compliance with ESOH requirements.  Although the primary focus is on HAZMAT procurement and issue in support of the AF mission, the broader objective is to protect the environment, safety and health of potentially affected workers and surrounding communities, and to reduce the dependence on HAZMAT through use of more environmentally friendly substitutes.  The HAZMART provides for process-based authorizing, procuring, issuing, tracking, and disposing of HAZMAT.  It is a repository for data required to meet reporting requirements, assess Air Force processes for pollution prevention opportunities, and measure success in minimizing HAZMAT use.  Services support the tracking of Hazardous Material  (HAZMAT) from cradle to grave.  Provide all personnel, supervision and services necessary to operate the HAZMART.  Alternatively or additionally, the service provider shall provide personnel, supervision and services necessary to accomplish administration of the AF-approved tracking system (or PACAF authorized equivalent), management of the AF-approved tracking system database, Compliance Assistance Visits and adhering to all Air Force policies and goals on HAZMAT minimization.  The service provider shall strictly adhere to federal, state, local, hazardous material and waste regulations, and overseas final governing standards, related to operating the HAZMART.  

∑	Monitor and track all Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) on applicable installations identified to the HAZMART from the time it enters the installation, until moved off the installation for disposal, reuse, or consumed by use, (barcode is the preferred method).  This includes material used by units deployed to the installation with hazardous materials, government-wide purchase card (GPC) procurements, contractor purchased/used, contracting purchased transactions, and supply system transactions.

∑	Participate in the base Hazardous Material Management Process (HMMP) team, Environmental Protection Committee (EPC), and appropriate subcommittees (i.e. Pollution Prevention Subcommittee).  These committees meet at least quarterly at applicable installations.  

∑	Enter pertinent HAZMAT data and track HAZMAT located on the installation in an AF-approved tracking system or designated PACAF-approved equivalent.  Serve as the first stop for submittal of AF authorization request information by reviewing submitted information and supporting materials for accuracy and completeness.  For any requested material that is not currently loaded in the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system immediately forward material information to the HMMP team for a determination whether it meets the HAZMAT definition in paragraph

∑	Focal point for hazardous material issues. Maintain and track items in a Free-Issue storage area in the HAZMART facility for all HAZMAT turned in from base customers.  Promote the free-issue operation through the use of web sites and other mediums such as the base bulletin/base newspaper.

∑	Maximize HAZMAT usage by reusing/redistributing excess HAZMAT on base to other Air Force bases, or through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) Reutilization, Transfer, Donation, and Sales (RTDS) program.  Before ordering or purchasing HAZMAT, determine if it is possible to obtain the HAZMAT from the installation free-issue, reuse, and redistribution program, as the preferred HAZMAT source.

∑	Work with customers and suppliers to ensure they purchase HAZMATs in practical quantities to minimize waste, handling, and storage costs.

∑	Perform quality control functions to properly identify items as possible HAZMATs to prevent inadvertent procurement or issue transactions for unauthorized materials.  Immediately notify the HMMP team of any suspected or potential HAZMAT that has not been properly coded as a HAZMAT.
∑	Assist users in identifying HAZMAT stock numbers and/or part numbers, and finding appropriate MSDS.

∑	Use the AF Class I ODS Requisition SAO Approval process described in AF Instructions/Policy.
