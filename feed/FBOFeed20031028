<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Digital Control System Components to be assembled for structural dynamics and controls reaearch. This system will also function as an identical back-up system for the Active Twist Rotor Digital Control System.  Components are as follows:  Item DS1005, PPC Board Power PC 750, 480 MHz, 128MB SDRAM and 16MB Flash memory; Item DS2003, ADC,MUX, 32 channels, 16-Bit, 2ADC's 32 channels of simultaneous sample and hold; Item DS 2101, DAC 6 channels 16 bit; Item DS 4002, Multi-Purpose Digital I/O, 8 timing channels, 200 ns resolution 32xdigital I/O; PHS-CAB6, PHS bus cable with 6 connectors and terminator; 10-slot expansion box, PX10/814/817/Opto 10 slot expansion box with high speedserial host interface consisting of a DS814, PC-side PCI bus DS8 17, and opto cable; Connector Panel, CS2003, connector panel for DS2003 (10 M.U. required); Item CP2102, Connector Panel for DS2102; CLP4002, Combined Connector & LED Panel for DS4002 (12 M.U. required); CDP Control Development Package, containing Real Time Interface Software, Control Desk Standard Developer Software, and MLIB/MTRACE software; CCPPPC PC Cross Compiler, Mocrotec PowerPC Cross Compiler (DS1103/DS1005/Micro Auto BOx Complier) NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from DSpace, Novi, MI as the only known source that can meet Agency requirements.  Components identical to those in the existing hardware sytem are necessary to guarantee hardware compatibility between the two systems.  Identical delveopment software is also required to insure programs and control algorithms in use with the existing system can be used with the new system.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 12, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

The incumbent may have multiple country assignments and is expected to either possess or acquire the ability to manage the broadest array of acquisition and assistance support assignments, with a minimum of supervision. A comprehensive knowledge of the acquisition and assistance processes is required since little of the work involves repetitive items and work is assigned based on the project support needs of the assigned countries, rather than the nature of the acquisition or assistance action. Each specialist is expected to be able to provide a full array of services, in conjunction with the Regional Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS), 4300 West 7th Street, Little Rock, Arkansas intends to negotiate a sole source contract for a Localisa Electrical Localization System (Cardiac Navigation System) by Medtronic USA, Inc., Atlanta, GA. The Government believes that Medtronic, USA, Inc. is the only manufacturer that will satisfy the agency requirement.  This is sole source procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1).  The Localize Cardiac Navigation System, when used with data from other devices, such as an RF power generator or and EP recording System, will allow the user to generate ablation data maps, cardiac electrical activation maps, cardiac electrical propagation maps, or cardiac electrical potential maps.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes, however; any firm that believes that it can meet the specifications above may give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, CAVHS will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Medtronic.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Microarray Facility Advanced Technology Center (ATC) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Compugen, Inc., 7 Centre Drive, Suite 9, Jamesburg, NJ 08831 a Compugen Human OligoLibrary Release 2.0.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325414 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The NCI's Advanced Technology Center (ATC) has one of it's missions, the goal of manufacturing quality microarrays for comprehensive gene expression analysis, provide training protocols and technical support for NCI researchers and develop new microarray technologies and applications.  High density DNA microarray technology has been used to achieve high throughput analysis of massively parallel genomic sequences.  These high-density arrays will be and have been used to perform expression studies, re-sequencing experiments, and genotype analysis on the genes of human, mouse, and other organisms.  The Compugen Human OligoLibrary is a necessary addition to the scientific resources and technical capabilities of the microarray facility at the ATC.  The NCI ATC Microarray facility is proposing to procure the Compugen Human OligoLibrary Release 2.0.  This oligo library is the only commercial source of 60 base long oligonucleotides that use MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to confirm molecular weight and to ensure correct well location and oligo sequence.  In addition capillary electrophoresis analysis is used to verify the length of the oligos.   Compugen employs extensive use of alternative splicing data beyond public information in their design of oligos, something which is not available to other manufacturers.  Compugen also incorporates their own unique discoveries about anti-sense gene pairs in the human genome to aid in the design of their oligos, information which is crucial in the successful design of many of the oligos.   Compugen is the only source known to the NCI that can supply the Human OligoLibrary Release 2.0 given the aforementioned specifications above.   This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, November 12, 2003.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Division of Intramural Research (DIR) Clinical Research Program (CRP) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a non competitive basis with Suburban Hospital, 8600 Old Georgetown Road, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. NIH initiated five (5) protocols on cardiac diseases in which Suburban Hospital is the sole cohort. The NIH does not have a sufficient patient population or skilled research nursing staff essential to assure development of these protocols. As such, the NIH requires regular access to patient populations that include acute cardiac patients such as those at Suburban Hospital. The protocols also require the service of skilled research nursing support to provide on-site enrollment, processing, and follow-up of patients at Suburban Hospital.  It is essential that these resources be in close proximity to the NIH campus to facilitate prompt access to NIH investigators and other available NIH clinical resources that may be required, specially in emergency situations.  The period of performance of the study is December 15, 2003 through December 15, 2004. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6, Competition Requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 623110, Size Standard $11.5 million. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Joy Kimble, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-2897
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis with University of Georgia, Athens Ga to analyze the relative proportions of stable isotopes of Carbon and Nitrogen to include the preparation of samples by grinding of the tissue samples and the proper storage of the prepared samples in small tin capsules designed for mass spectrometers in support of the National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) in Cincinnati, Ohio.  EPA is interested in the proper preparation of tissue samples for stable isotope analysis and it is  critical to have precise results. A mass spectrometer is required to analyze the relative proportions of stable isotopes of Carbon and Nitrogen in the prepared tissue samples.  Strict quality control and chain of custody procedures must be employed to ensure the accuracy and validity of the data  generated.  It is imperative and necessary that a single laboratory be employed for both the preparation and the analysis of the samples.  To do otherwise would significantly increase the potential for unacceptable variability in the data generated.  An extensive market research has been conducted  which identified only one domestic laboratory capable of preparing AND  analyzing the frozen tissue samples.  The University of Georgia (Stable Isotope Laboratory) (UGASIL) was the only source identified that would accept the shipment of frozen samples, take them through all the preparation steps  and analyze the samples in accordance with the established protocols. These are the reasons that EPA believes University Of Georgia is the only source capable of providing the specific services and the only source that would accept the frozen samples.  Objective: The purpose of this project is to  complete the ongoing food web studies of a site near Clemson, SC which requires laboratory analysis utilizing the expertise and resources that are currently unavailable at the EPA facilities in Cincinnati.  Scope of Work:  Under this project, the Contractor  shall perform the following tasks:  TASK  1- Sample Analysis and Preparation: (approximately 1372 samples)  a) Fully prepare (dry, grind, weigh, and package) samples of organic matter for analysis by mass   spectrometry; b) Analyze samples for relative ratios of N15 and C13.  Holding Times:  Samples will be held at -20? C for no more than  30 days. EPA will ship the "frozen" samples to the contractor for analysis.  Samples shall be processed and analyzed within 45 days of receipt.  Data shall be provided to US EPA upon completion of analysis.  Quality Assurance/Quality Control:  Contractor shall run five tin capsule blanks in every  batch to correct for trace amounts of N and C gas.  Contractor shall run recalibrant standards every 10 unknowns to correct for drift.  Trace correction and recalibrant standards shall  run free-of-charge to the client.  TASK 2 - Chain of Custody: a) US EPA NERL will send frozen samples to UGASIL  via overnight courier.  Samples will be numbered sequentially -- 1, 2, 3 ... -- with US EPA keeping a key that translates these numbers into any more complicated coding scheme. b) UGASIL shall store samples at -20? C prior to analysis.  c) UGASIL shall return unused portion of samples to US EPA  (address will be provided upon award).  Shipping will be UPS Ground.  DELIVERABLE: Data from analysis shall be in the form of an Excel spreadsheet sent via email and on CD sent via regular ground mail.  PEFORMANCE PERIOD: One year from award date.  The North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a small business size standard of $6.0 million, is applicable.   All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities in writing within 15 days of the date of this announcement.  No Solicitation is  available.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any additional source (s) exist and, therefore, no Request for Proposal (RFP) is available.  Consequently, any response (s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy  of the RFP will be ignored.  Submit response no later than 11 November 2003 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attn: Joy Kimble, RTP-POD (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 or via email to kimble.joy@epa.gov.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK 
For 
Insert for Spanish Language/Hispanic Newspapers and Periodicals

The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) seeks to enter into one or more no-cost contracts for production of advertorial inserts to be published in Spanish or English language news oriented periodicals targeting the Hispanic community.  The advertorials must be issued during commemoration of the Agency’s 50th Anniversary, between September, 2003 and September, 2004.  Advertorials may be distributed on a national, regional or local basis.

Background:

SBA celebrates its 50th Anniversary this year and as part of the celebration will spotlight entrepreneurs from across the country.   National recognition of the Agency’s 50th Anniversary kicked off August 1 at The Dwight D. Eisenhower Library and Museum in Abilene, Kansas to commemorate President Eisenhower’s signing of the Small Business Act on July 30, 1953.   The SBA’s Web site at http://www.sba.gov lists the 50th Anniversary events. The inserts are intended to take advantage of the Anniversary’s proximity to raise awareness of small business issues.

Scope:

SBA plans multiple awards to contractors under which each will write, publish, and distribute a four-page minimum insert in the periodical’s circulation area.  The content of the insert must include information relevant to small businesses, be tailored to local geographic interests and provide information on SBA’s programs and services.  The contractor must produce the insert at no cost to the U.S. government and may recoup all its expenses by selling advertisements or by otherwise obtaining financial support for the project.  

The contractor will assign at least one person to serve as primary contact and work directly with the assigned technical representative in SBA’s Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) to develop story ideas and content for the insert.  The contractor may use its own reporters or material from other sources, for which it has obtained appropriate rights.    The contractor must submit a final draft of the insert, including ads, to the technical representative for SBA’s approval before publication.  SBA may edit the content as it sees fit.

Although Spanish language translation is not a contract requirement, the contractor is responsible for any translation of information into Spanish, as it deems necessary.  For material prepared exclusively in Spanish, the contractor must be prepared, if necessary, to furnish English translation to SBA’s technical representative.

The contractor must receive all funds directly and pay all expenses, including any cost overruns, associated with the writing, production, and distribution of the insert.  The contractor will be responsible for all costs and logistics of creating the insert, including production, design, promotion, marketing, advertising and distribution in the markets served by the contractor’s publications.

In addition to the writing, publication, and distribution of the insert, the contractor must print extra copies, in a mutually-agreed upon quantity, to be established in the proposal.  If the insert is to be distributed on a local or regional basis only, the contractor must also distribute the copies to SBA’s field offices, Service Corps of Retired Executives chapters, Small Business Development Centers, Women Business Centers, and SBA lending partners within the publication’s circulation area.  

Requirements:

The contractor must be a publisher of a newspaper or periodical targeting the Hispanic community or an entity with the capability to write, print and distribute a four-page minimum insert within a publication targeting the Hispanic community. If the contractor is not a publisher of a newspaper or periodical, it must demonstrate in its proposal that it has made distribution arrangements with a newspaper or periodical oriented towards the Hispanic community.

SBA contemplates the inserts may be distributed on a national, regional or local level by any one contractor.   To avoid over-saturation in a given market, SBA reserves the right to negotiate distribution efforts in markets with multiple awards.

Publications containing the insert need not be exclusively news oriented.  However, periodicals consisting of only paid advertising and no editorial content are not eligible.

Deliverables:

The deliverables may vary but as a minimum each insert will consist of four-pages, with two-pages of content. Insert to be distributed as set out above. 

Period of Performance:

The contractor may propose any publication and distribution date between date of award and September, 2004.

Basis for Award:

SBA plans to accept all technically acceptable proposals from responsible contractors, except to avoid duplication in a particular market.  SBA plans to award without discussions unless discussions could prove advantageous in a particular circumstance.  To avoid duplication, if SBA receives two or more approximately equal proposals covering overlapping circulation areas, it reserves the right to hold discussions and to negotiate acceptable publication dates, numbers of copies, distribution and general areas of content prior to award.

The evaluation factors in section M of the solicitation will be used both to determine whether a proposal is technically acceptable and, if necessary, to choose among proposals in a geographic area.

SBA’s cooperation: 
  
•	provide a welcome letter from SBA Administrator Hector V. Barreto for the insert; 
•	provide access to SBA officials and other personnel employed by SBA for interviews and information for the insert articles;
•	provide the contractor with use of SBA’s logo and the SBA’s 50th anniversary logo for limited purposes; 
•	permit the contractor to claim copyright in original material;
•	permit the contractor to identify itself in the insert; 
•	serve as an advisor and information source for the editorial content of the product, 
•	assign at least one staff person to work with contractor,
•	meet all production deadlines as provided by contractor,
•	identifying experts and successful small businesses as appropriate in the markets served by both the SBA and the contractor, and
•	have final approval of the final draft insert, including advertising, prior to printing.

Evaluation Factors

•	Experience of the offeror in writing and publishing similar content.
•	(If the contractor is not a publisher):  Experience of the distributor.
•	Ability of the distribution network to reach the intended audience.
•	Quality of previous publications. 
•	(If translating):  Experience of the translators.
•	Understanding of business issues of interest to the Hispanic community in the area to be served by the publication.
•	[If more than one in a market area and more than one proposes similar content or publication schedules]:  The ability of the offeror to reach the target audience.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

A7.  Only Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is excluded from proposing under this broad agency announcement based on a real or apparent conflict of interest within JTO management. Other FFRDC’s may compete consistent with constraints found within the broad agency announcement.  

Q8. Clarify the reference to firm offers relating to white paper submission in the BAA.  
A8. Offerors should submit a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate with white paper submissions. The Government will not consider this a firm offer, but an estimate subject to negotiation.         

Q9. In section BC: 02) Beam Control: Atmospheric disturbance – define the term “complex visibility.”
A9.  Complex visibility-the Fourier transform of the object flux angular distribution. In simpler terms, if one can provide a measure of the complex visibility, one has a measure of the visibility modulus and visibility phase simultaneously.  

Q10. What is the acceptable annual cost ceiling for proposed projects?  
A10. Proposals in the advanced laser topic area are limited to $200k for the basic (first year) effort.  All other topic areas are limited to $1M for the basic effort and $1M for the option.  The option year of an Advanced Laser proposal may not exceed $1M, but the Government may make awards greater than $200k only in cases that have a large potential for exceeding existing technology efforts. The Government may unilaterally exercise the option based on funding availability for the topic area, the potential value of the proposed option year effort to the Government, and on the success of the basic contract.   

Q11.  Reference Section CL: 04) Deuterium Fluoride (DF) Laser: Exhaust Free operation:  Does Exhaust Free Operation equate to, or mean the same thing as, sealed exhaust? 
A11.  Yes.  Plume free operation is analogous to sealed exhaust system.

Q12.  Does the three-page limitation for the technical/management section include tables, figures, pictures and references?
A12.  Yes.  The Government will count any information necessary to convey the required information against the three-page limit.  The Government will not evaluate appendices or other addenda to the technical/management section that exceed the three-page limit.

Q13.  Will the Government consider a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) or technology investment agreement (TIA) as a possible contractual vehicle for award under this solicitation?
A13.  No.  The Government will award only contracts.

Q14.  How may industry partner with DoD organizations under this BAA?
A14.  Industrial offerors may enter into a Memorandum of Agreement for facility support services as part of their offer under the BAA to use Government available laboratories, test ranges, or other facilities.  The JTO or other source will separately and directly pay for these services. The Government will consider the cost for these services part of the total cost of the BAA contract and count them against the cost cap; the offeror must account for these costs in the ROM and any subsequent cost proposals. The offeror may use an existing DoD cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) or technology investment agreement (TIA) under this BAA.
Q15. The BAA expresses interest in "eye safe" lasers in the 1.5-1.8 um region. Has the Government interest in other "eye safe" wavelengths within atmospheric windows?
A15. The Government has interest in other wavelengths if found within a window that allows good propagation through the atmosphere.
Q16.  What is the required ROM cost estimate format? 
A.16. There is no standard format for the ROM cost estimate.  It can be as brief
as a one single dollar figure that represents the estimated cost of the work
proposed but may also be a breakdown of the major components of the items
that make up the costs (e.g. Labor, materials, etc.) and could also be
broken down by Tasks.  The breakdown of the total costs should typically be no more than ten items.

Q17. Will the Government consider a single white paper that addresses more than one technical area?
A17. Yes.


Q18. Will the Government accept white papers in Times New Roman 10 font size? 
Q18. Yes. 

Q19. Will the Government accept the schedule in Fast Track instead of MS Project?
A.19. No. End of questions and answers.

<DESC>COMBINED SYNPOSIS/SOLICITATION
DTTS59-03-R-00570
AIRLINE CONSULTANT SERVICES

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is DTTS59-03-R-00507 and it is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 14. This procurement is a full and open commercial buy under NAICS Codes: 541611, 541613, 541614, 541690, 541910, 54172 or 54191. The solicitation is to examine how demand for air travel has changed in recent years, incorporating the current industry downturn, and especially to identify differences in passenger responses at different price levels for the Department of Transportation (DOT), in Washington, DC. Proposal instructions and the complete Statement of Work (SOW) are attached.  The anticipated contract is firm-fixed-price for the requirements defined in the SOW. The anticipated period of performance is a base period from October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004 with two (2) one-year option periods. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, and FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The evaluation factors to be used are 1) quantity and quality of non-USDOT data 2) econometric Model, 3) past performance , 4) management approach and 5) fixed price. Quality/quantity of non-USDOT data (factor 1) is more important than econometric modeling (factor 2) and past performance (factor 3), which are considered of equal importance and more important than management approach (factor 4), while price (factor 5) will be considered the last factor that will be evaluated but not scored.

<DESC>C5AMP - C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) The USAF, Aero Systems Center, WPAFB, OH contemplates the issuance of sole  source contractual actions to extend the C-5 Avionics Modernization Program  (AMP) Production Kit Modification Options commencing in FY05 necessary to modify a quantity of up to  eighty-two (82) operational C-5 A/B/C aircraft, and to extend CLS by issuance  of a follow-on successor contract.  The re-phasing of the AMP Mod Program due  to budget adjustments and lapsed option timelines requires that the option  prices be revalidated and adjusted due to fact of life program changes.   Lockheed-Martin Corporation was awarded the C-5AMP EMD and Production contract  under a full and open, best value source selection competition.  Lockheed- Martin is completing Phase I EMD and will be required to validate and Kit Proof  TCTO 1C-5-714, certifying to the configuration and aircraft functional and  physical compliances, scheduled for mid-summer 2004.  Original contract options  for Lots I and II were adjusted and production initiated in April 03 by  authorizing Production Lot I and establishing an option for Lot II.  The  government does not possess adequate or certified specifications or technical  data suitable for competing Lots III, IV and V.  Production Option Lots III, IV  and V will be restructured for execution based upon the ranges present in the FY05  PB.  Negotiating ranges of 7 to 50 annual aircraft kit modifications will be  considered for each option lot.  Necessary production, management and technical  data will be acquired along with spare parts, peculiar test equipment, in-service engineering and air vehicle trainer sub- kits.  Lockheed-Martin Corp is the only source possessing the technical and  engineering expertise to continue the production modification the C-5 AMP Kits,  maintaining total schedule, configuration and TISPR continuity of the re-phased  acquisition.  Sole source negotiation for extension of the production  modification option for the C-5 AMP and extended logisitical support is based  pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), implemented under FAR 6.302-1  and/or 41 USC 233(e)(1), as further implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).   Formal RFP will not be issued and bidding materials will not be available since this  action is dealing with proprietary technical and cost data, available only for  use by the Government agencies to restructure and validate the lapsed  production modification options,and establish the extened logistics support. Direct all inquiries to Mr. C. P. Mengos, Contracting Officer, ASC/GRA-K, Bldg  558, 2590 Loop Road West, Wright-Patterson AFB, Oh 45433-7142, Phone 937-255- 1029.

<DESC>28 Oct 03:  UPDATE:  RFP Released.  See the four new postings. RFP, Onsite Demo Database, Model Task Order, Sample Model Task Order ========================================================================== 27 Oct 03: SCHEDULE UPDATE:  RFP should be ready for release today or  tomorrow.  Due dates are as follows:  The offeror’s past performance  information or no-bid reply must be received by 1:00 PM EDT on 5 Nov 03.  The  remainder of offeror+s proposal, including all data and information requested,  must be received before 1:00 PM EDT on 12 Nov 03.   ====================================================================== 24 Oct 03: SCHEDULE CHANGE:  RFP not expected to be released today, expect  early next week. ====================================================================== 24 Oct 03:  UPDATE:  Added two documents to offeror library for  information/reference only (3.3 Blueprint + Plan and Prgm Model).  As  entitled,  they are conceptual and provide guidance only -- offerors are not  bound to these designs, as you may have better ones. ====================================================================== 24 Oct 03:  UPDATE:  Added one more question/answer from offeror regarding the  on-site demonstrations. ====================================================================== 22 Oct 03:  UPDATE:  Additional questions and answers document has been added  to file repository ======================================================================= 17 Oct 03:  UPDATE:  Updated SOO, Version 2, to include the Option for IT-SE  has been added to the file repository. ======================================================================= 17 Oct 03:  REQUIREMENT CHANGE:  The Government is considering adding an effort  to the TD P+P task order as a unilateral option that could be exercised at a  later time, at the sole discretion of the Government.  Offerors planning to  submit bids for the TD P+P would be required to bid this work as well.  This  work would include software integration and travel, in order to interface the  TD P+P module of the EBS to GOTS prototype/proof of concept applications,  described below, that serve the automation needs of scientists and engineers.   This application, currently in development, will provide scientists an  intuitive interface to an automated process for creating, storing, and printing  Case Files.  Training needs are expected to be minimal to nonexistent.  We are  in the process of defining this requirement and will make more details  available as soon as possible.           Automated R+D Case File Proof of Concept - A build and automation of  process workflows that focus on AFRL Work Unit Management processes of the  S+Es. The application will build and then automate these workflows, where  additional user input screens will be designed and built to guide S+Es through  the data entry steps of each phase of Case File generation. A relational  database will be built to store normalized data for select AFRL forms so that  data entered once by the S+Es can be reused in future steps. Once forms are  complete and approved, the proof of concept will allow S+Es to print them for  physical filing into the paper Case File, as well as electronically file them  into the EBS Document and Records manager. The reporting features of the proof  of concept will ideally integrate the PureEdge form manager functionality,  depending on policy directives for use of that tool.           Work Center Support Proof of Concept - This user interface will be  designed and specifically configured for the S+Es. In this interface, S+Es will  be able to open a "one-stop-shop" portal instance and have access to select  common enterprise and personal applications and information. Ideally, each  individual application will appear in the interface as an object or applet,  which links to or initiates an application function as necessary. Some of these  applications have been identified and requested by the S+Es, a "yellow pages"  capability, for example. This build model will allow S+Es to access a list of  said application applets and "subscribe" to the functions of choice or  necessity. AFRL constituents, knowing the required framework for applet design  and configuration, could then potentially have their applications considered  for the applet library, assuming there are no technical, policy or process  conflicts. ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST UPDATE:  The preliminary information  contained at the end of the Industry Day Q+A attachment has been coordinated  and approved and should be considered final. ======================================================================== 15 Oct 03: Updated: The draft model task order has been updated, as reflected  in the "Draft Model TO 15 Oct" version now visible on this website.  We have  added the IOC and FOC dates to the document. ======================================================================== 14 Oct 03:  Update:  Questions and Answers from Industry Day posted as an  attachment along with information on conflicts of interest.  DRAFT Model Task  Order added to documents list.  OFFERORS ARE REQUESTED TO REVIEW DOCUMENTS AND  PROVIDE ANY WRITTEN COMMENTS/SUGGESTIONS TO christopher.parsons@wpafb.af.mil OR  lynne.lair@wpafb.af.mil.  EARLY INDUSTRY INPUTS MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO TAILOR  THIS ACQUISITION. ======================================================================= 7 Oct 03 NOTICE: DRAFT Documents from Industry Day have been posted to this  website.  More to follow soon.  Request all PRIME Encore contractors verify  receipt of this updated information by sending a confirmation e-mail to  christopher.parsons@wpafb.af.mil or lynne.lair@wpafb.af.mil.  Thank you. ====================================================================== The HQ Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is contemplating awarding a task  order pursuant to the authorities established under Defense Information Systems  Agency (DISA) Encore GWAC Contracts (http://www.acquireit.disa.mil).  The  following preliminary information is for all DISA Encore Contract Holders.   Interested subcontractors contact Encore prime contractors via the above DISA  website. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is drafting an IT requirement for  Technology Directorate-Level Planning and Programming (TD Level P+P).  The  purpose of this notice is to establish contact with all interested Encore  contractors and provide preliminary program information.  Please provide  telephone and e-mail information for your primary point of contact for this  effort to the AFRL contracts negotiator, Ms Lynne Lair, at  lynne.lair@wpafb.af.mil by 22 Sep 03.  Future Information will be via  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/ under short title "EBS TD-Level P+P",  solicitation number "FA8652-04-Q-0002".   Preliminary requirements overview:  TD Level P+P is a component of the larger  AFRL Enterprise Business System (EBS) program, which provides integrated  business processes and smart enterprise-wide IT Portfolio Management.  Quality  and schedule are critical to successful integration of this component into the  larger program.  TD Level P+P will support planning and programming processes  at all geographically separate TDs and integrate with the HQ-level P+P effort  already under development. The TD-level P+P capability will be provided via  commercial off the shelf (COTS) software and will integrate with the standard  EBS database and provide input, analytical, and reporting tools to facilitate  TD planning and programming and inputs to HQ-level P+P.  AFRL anticipates this  requirement will include configuration of the COTS tools for AFRL processes,  COTS licenses, customer training, warranties/software maintenance, and follow- on technical support. Tentative Schedule:   Industry day - at Wright-Patterson AFB OH - 14 Oct 03 (date/location not  finalized yet) T.O. award -  Mid-Dec 03 Software Delivery - End of Mar 04 Preliminary Acquisition Information:  As part of the technical evaluation,  offerors will be required to demonstrate proposed software in a number of  scenarios on-site at HQ AFRL, WPAFB OH.  AFRL anticipates that one task order  will be placed with the Encore contractor that offers the best value to AFRL.   This task order will be incrementally funded and is currently subject to  availability of funds, as FY04 funds are currently not available for obligation. ---All information herein is preliminary only and subject to change as the AFRL  team finalizes the requirement---  Please hold your questions/comments for  now.  We will be actively seeking industry feedback on our draft requirements  soon.  Do not contact the technical team directly.  Further information will be  provided to interested offerors by this office on the PIXS website as it  becomes available.

<DESC>COMBAT TALON II Amendment 002(28 Oct 03)- As follows: The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) through a team at  Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) and Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR- ALC) is analyzing industry capabilities to convert 10 existing C-130 aircraft  into 10 MC-130 Combat Talon IIs.  An initial industry opportunity to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the Plus-10 program was held on 4 March 2003.  All contractors  attending were given a short descriptive briefing of the Plus-10 program and an  opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program requirements and to  present their capabilities and concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This initial step allowed the government team to  determine market understanding and capability to integrate and complete the  program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement. In general terms, the program’s intent will be to conduct an initial  modification to 10 existing C-130H2 aircraft.  The modification will convert  these ten aircraft into Talon II “like” aircraft minus the avionics required to  perform the terrain following/terrain avoidance (TF/TA) mission.  After  completion of this initial modification these ten aircraft will go directly  into the existing C-130 Avionic Modernization Program (AMP)/ Common Avionic  Architecture for Penetration (CAAP) program.  The overall objective will be  after the Plus-10 and the AMP/CAAP modification the final configuration of  these aircraft will be common, to the maximum extent possible, to the rest of  the Talon II fleet (post AMP/CAAP.)  Initial analysis by the government  indicates the systems listed in attachment 1 will be required to be installed  as part of the Plus-10 program.  This list is intended to only provide initial  guidance and is to be considered a working document that will evolve, as the  requirements are better defined.  (Please contact 1Lt Kelley Poree to request a  copy of attachment 1 as it will not be posted on the Internet).  In addition to  installing the current Talon II capability, the Plus-10 program will develop,  install and test an Autonomous Landing Capability (ALC) system.  An important  factor for this program will be to ensure a smooth and timely transition  between the Plus-10 program and the AMP/CAAP program.  Therefore, any approach  is required to clearly define how this transition can be accomplished.   Alternatives to these capabilities/ systems will not be considered as the  intent of the Plus-10 program is to provide the Air Force Special Operations  Forces (AFSOC) with MC-130H Talon II capabilities, seamless with current AFSOC  aircraft in their sustainment and support concept. ASC/LU will brief proposed acquisition strategy to the USSOCOM Acquisition  Executive in the November 2003 timeframe.  Additional information will be  available after this briefing and will be provided in a subsequent announcement. Any organization or company can obtain Combat Talon II announcements and  instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.  Questions regarding  the technical information mentioned in this announcement should be directed to  Philip Bourgoine (937)255-1791, mailto: philip.bourgoine@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), University Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15240 intends to negotiate with Allegheny General Hospital (AGH), 320 East North Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA  15212-4772, on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 for renal transplant surgeon services to be provided at the VAPHS University Drive Division during the period January 1, 2004 – December 31, 2004.  The requirement is for 0.5 FTE renal transplant surgeon(s) for preoperative workup, postoperative follow-up, clinic visits, and clinic rounds.  In addition, payment will be made on a per procedure basis for each renal transplant performed.  It is estimated that 8-15 renal transplants will be performed during the contract period.  AGH will provide “on-call” coverage for emergencies whenever not on site at VAPHS. Our expectation is that AGH will function as part of an ongoing transplant program, participating in all aspects of program development and administration, and provide dedicated staff for this contract. Firms who wish to identify their interest and capability to provide renal transplant surgeon services as described above to the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System may notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, no later than November 10, 2003. C.O.B.  Notification shall be mailed to Linda Glancy (04A-H), Contracting Officer, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206 or e-mailed to Linda.Glancy@med.va.gov.  The notification must consist of a narrative describing the contractor’s location and qualifications to demonstrate that the contractor can meet our requirements for renal transplant surgeon services.  Upon receipt of any such notifications, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with sole source negotiations. The VA prefers that the renal transplant surgeon(s) be board certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.

To accomplish this action, the following must occur: 1)	The Contractor must design and establish policies and procedures detailing each step in the re-labeling process specific to the SNS program. These policies and procedures must confirm to existing FDA and DEA mandated regulations and comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices to prevent the misbranding or adulteration of SNS products.  2)	Either the SNS Program or the contractor will ship the product for re-labeling to the Contractors FDA and DEA licensed facility for processing.  The contractor must maintain an FDA licensed Re-labeling facility adequate in size to manage the projected volume required of this project.  All transportation vehicles utilized must be able to maintain environmental and be able document these conditions to ensure the integrity of the products being shipped.  All vehicles must also have the capability to be tracked and contacted to verify the location of all the SNS programs assets at anytime during transport.  * The contractor must provide pricing for this project based on two shipping parameters. The first will be for product shipped to and from the Contractors re-labeling facility with all shipping coordinated and managed by the SNS. The second parameter will be for the Contractor to develop an SNS approved shipping program, controlled by the Contractor but monitored by the SNS. 3)	The contractor to design a program that would require the contractor to establish and train a re-labeling team of contractor employees to visit each one of confidential SNS storage site locations within the United States and it’s territories on a regular and ongoing basis for the purpose of performing the re-labeling process to include all of the requisite policies, procedures, and ongoing documentation acceptable to the FDA for remote re-labeling of multiple manufacturer’s medical materiel.  The contractors remote re-labeling will be escorted by SNS program logisticians and must be able to sign a non-disclosure statement to keep storage on a need to know basis.  The procedures must be designed and detailed in a unique manual controlled by the contractor with a copy of the manual distributed to each SNS storage site. Each copy of the manual must be assigned a control number for proper tracking. The contractor will be responsible for providing the SNS Program with ongoing updates to the manual consistent with any changes mandated by the FDA, DEA, and or ongoing amendments to applicable regulations governing the storage, packaging, and labeling of medical materiel.   4)	The contractor must establish statistically acceptable procedures for the inspection of each lot of product to be re-labeled, to assure the product is properly and adequately identified, that the product to be relabeled consists of a single lot of a single product, from a single original manufacturer, that each container in the lot has an identical original manufacturers expiration date and that the original manufacturer packaging system remains intact and acceptable for the re-labeling processes.  5)	The Contractor must establish applicable forms and records that are adequate to properly, accurately, and consistently document all of the steps required under the regulations to actually perform the re-labeling process on multiple original manufacturers product maintained by the SNS Program and to maintain these records in a manner acceptable to the FDA and DEA. 6)	Upon the request of the SNS Program the contractor must be able to design procedures for creating new product labeling that confirms with existing FDA and DEA labeling regulations. The Contractor must ensure the new labeling is identical in content as the original labeling except for the new extended dating information and that each label is adhered to the manufacturer’s original container with pharmaceutical grade glue to ensure it cannot be easily removed by the end user.  7)	The contractor will be responsible for attaching the new labeling to each applicable product container and assuring a complete and accurate reconciliation and documentation of each lot of labels used in the re-labeling process to prevent the inadvertent mislabeling of any other product. 8)	The contractor will be responsible for re-labeling the outer cartons of each manufacturer lot of product in addition to each drug container to assure complete labeling consistency between the outer and inner labeling for each product. 9)	The contractor will be responsible for maintaining accurate records of all re-labeling activities that assure complete and ongoing trace ability of each step in the re-label process for annual review by the FDA or DEA.  10)	The contractors must be registered and have applicable licenses with the FDA and DEA in the areas of manufacturing, packaging, and labeling.  Require contractor have background and expertise in FDA and DEA approved re-labeling programs for human drugs and medical devices.   11)	The contractor must maintain an FDA licensed Re-labeling facility adequate in size to manage the projected volume required of this project. 12)	The contractor must maintain an FDA and DEA approved employee-training program to assure all employees involved in this project are adequately, properly and routinely trained in FDA current Good Manufacturing Practices, DEA regulatory compliance, and that each employee is competent to perform the tasks assigned to them regarding this project. 13)	The decision to defer or complete re-labeling will be made by the SNS Program based on urgency of need and timeline for re-labeling in a contingency situation.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to provide The Aviation Into-plane Reimbursement (AIR) Card and Ship’s bunkers’ Easy Acquisition (SEA) Card programs with a single credit card facilitator.  These are programs in which the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) uses commercially available technology to provide credit card services to all Department of Defense and Federal Civilian agencies for the worldwide procurement of aviation and ships bunker fuel and related ancillary services at commercial airports and seaports.  Currently there are over 20,000 active cards and on average 20,000 transactions per month in upwards of 1000 locations.  The Government prefers to eliminate the need for Government Furnish Equipment in this program.  The AIR Card program works in conjunction with the well-established DESC Into-plane contract program.  The SEA Card program works similarly to the AIR Card program with some differences.  The AIR/SEA Card program management office designates one card per plane or vessel, each grouped under DESC designated Approving Officials (AO).  AOs are designated to assign responsibility for card usage and to reflect a unit’s hierarchical make-up.  The cards, training, billing, agreements with contracted vendors, hardware and software, record keeping, and coordination are all conducted by the card facilitator.   Card transactions are executed electronically, but may be completed manually, if required.  The purchases made are generally for fuel from a DESC contract, but non-contract local purchases are also charged to the card.  The card facilitator will split the invoice between the unit for ancillary purchases and DESC for fuel purchases.  The card facilitator shall be required to interface with DESC financial and other automated systems.  Occasionally the program contractor will act as the Government agent to establish agreements with foreign nations and or firms for the sale of fuel.  

This is a request for information only.  A draft solicitation shall be issued in November.  Vendors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information sought including, commercial market information and company information via e-mail or facsimile (703-767-8506) to Marlene Hines, no later than November 14, 2003. Responses should include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone number and e-mail address; business size, small business or small disadvantaged business status, 8(a) or HUB Zone status; corporate affiliations; potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, and or major subcontractor or (prime). Please specify any questions or concerns to the Contract Specialist for this action Marlene Hines via email.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking sources, and suggested solutions, to the repackaging of Sildenafil Citrate (Viagra) for it's seven Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacies (CMOPs) located throughout the US.  Each CMOP is an automated prescription processing facility, with an average estimated daily output in excess of thirty thousand prescriptions per day per CMOP.  The automation includes, but is not limited to, the ability to process pre-packaged bottles and boxes of varying sizes.  Manual dispensing also occurs. An ongoing requirement exists for the VA CMOPs to fill prescriptions for Sildenafil Citrate (Viagra), in 50mg and 100 mg strength, in packages of two (2) and four (4) tablets per container per strength.  Your suggested packaging should allow for quick recognition of the volume and strength contained within the package.  Your suggested packaging should be of sufficient size to allow a prescription label measuring no more than 5-1/2 X 2-3/16 inches to be affixed to it, and it should be tamper proof. In most instances, dispensing occurs manually from within a controlled environment, however that may vary by CMOP, and could include automation.  For your solution estimation purposes only, the following historic data is being provided on the volume of work that the VA experienced in the period 8/1/02 - 7/30/03: all seven VA CMOPs, combined, filled approximately 602,000 prescriptions of 2 each 100 mg tablets; approximately 470,000 prescriptions of 4 each 100 mg tablets; approximately 39,000 prescriptions of 2 each 50 mg tablets; and approximately 44,000 prescriptions of the 4 each 50 mg tablets. Your firm must already be FDA-approved to repackage prescription pharmaceuticals.  It is not necessary that your firm have a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract in order to provide suggested solutions.  However, please specify, when submitting your suggested solution(s), if your firm has an FSS contract in place, data to readily identify that FSS contract, and whether or not your FSS contract includes pharmaceutical repackaging of the nature that is being sought. This announcement is not for the purpose of obtaining definitive priced proposals for your suggested solution(s), nor is it for the purpose of establishing a new FSS contract or any other form of contract.  This sources sought announcement is for the purpose of obtaining suggested solutions for repackaging of this prescription drug, in the strengths and volumes (two or four 50mg or 100mg pills per package) indicated.  Your suggested solution may take the form of various sizes and types of bottles, "blister" -type unit dose packaging, or any other innovative packaging method that you may have developed.  Your standard commercial pricing information is requested.  Do not include prices for the Sildenafil Citrate (Viagra).  The current intent will be that each CMOP would provide the pharmaceuticals in bulk form for repackaging. Once a repackaging solution(s) has been selected, a solicitation will be issued for competitive proposals.

<SUBJECT>47 -- Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance Notice
<DESC>Dear Valued Contractor
     
We are excited to announce that we are finally able to offer you the opportunity to join us in the deployment of Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA).  

WAWF-RA is designed to automate Commercial Invoices and Government Receiving Reports in a web based, paperless environment.  WAWF-RA electronically captures and coordinates the four basic pieces of our payment process.  WAWA-RA users input their invoices and receiving reports via the Internet, and are compared to contracts stored in the Defense Finance Accounting System (DFAS) - Electronic Document Access (EDA) system. Once the invoice and receiving reports are approved and processed, payment transactions are initiated via Electronic File Protocol (EFT) to the contractor’s bank account.  DCMA at various locations (see below) has arranged to provide training to Contractor users of the new system.  They respectfully request you and/or your representative plan to attend one of these training sessions to be conducted at Comp USA sites.   You will need to contact the CompUSA Classroom POC identified on attached schedule in your geographic area to reserve a space for the training.  Additional training is available on-line at <https://skyraider.slidell.disa.mil> (About WAWF-RA).

There are no costs involved, registration and software are all provided FREE of charge and DCMA team will be there every step of the way if you need assistance.

<DESC>The High Energy Laser (HEL) Joint Technology Office (JTO), Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Albuquerque, New Mexico, solicits white papers for science and technology projects required to support development of directed energy weapon (DEW) systems. The OSD HEL JTO program develops and executes a DoD-wide, coordinated management and investment strategy to take advantage of opportunities presented by advances in HEL technologies. The JTO vision is that HELs will be a viable weapons alternative in modern warfare. The JTO mission is to lead DoD’s integrated development of HEL weapon technology.  The JTO’s objective is to make HELs lightweight, affordable, supportable, and effective on the modern battlefield.  The program will promote projects, research, scientific studies, or other initiatives providing farsighted, high payoff research leading to advances in HEL science and technology. The HEL JTO has established a two-step process for offerors submitting a white paper under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Part 1 requires submission of a white paper for evaluation and notification; Part 2 requires an oral presentation.  The HEL JTO must receive papers submitted in response to this announcement by 1600 MST on 3 October 2003. The expected award date is March 15, 2004.  Approximately $11M in awards may be made in FY04; JTO estimates a $22M budget for all projects for fiscal years 04 and 05.  However, there is no certainty in the level of funding. The white paper shall consist of a technical section, ROM cost, a schedule, and resumes.  Final detailed instructions for preparing and submitting each component herein is found below and in external sources referenced. The white paper, subsequent oral presentation, proposed contractor-developed Statement of Work (SOW) and cost proposal submitted by an offeror in response to this BAA are the only vehicles available to the offeror for receiving consideration for award.  This program shall issue no other solicitation relating to this requirement for FY 2004. Offerors should consult FedBizOpps, the Government –wide point of entry for any amendments to this BAA.   The Government reserves the right to award a procurement instrument best suited to the nature of the technology development proposed.  White papers may be for projects that can be completed within a year of award, or may be for multiple-year (maximum two (2) year) projects, if the subsequent year can be funded (separately priced) as an individual option with clearly defined milestones and deliverables in each year. The Government may award to all, some, or none of the proposals received.  If the Government fails to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror(s), the Government may conduct negotiations with another acceptable offeror. The Government avails this requirement to unrestricted full and open competition.  The HEL JTO encourages all businesses (including small businesses), academia, and civilian government agencies to propose on this solicitation. Offerors must indicate if they are small, small disadvantaged, 8(a) certified, woman-owned, or hub-zone certified.  The HEL JTO encourages teams and partnerships among commercial entities, academia, and government agencies.  All DOD FFRDC’s, may submit proposals responding to this announcement. Other FFRDC’s, the C3I Lab, Lincoln Laboratory, Software Engineering Institute or contractors, that propose using FFRDC’s not discussed herein shall provide rationale in their proposal justifying that the research falls within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort or special competency of the FFRDC, and that proposed research will not compete with the private sector.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this acquisition is 541710; the size standard is 500 employees.  Support contractors may read, review, and/or administratively handle all white papers.  Employees of the Federal government and support contractors to OSD/HEL JTO are individually bound by appropriate nondisclosure requirements with signed nondisclosure and organizational conflict of interest statements and are prohibited from competition in this technical area. Offerors shall sign and return with their white papers a consent to administrative access, AFMCFARS 5352.215-9007 “Use of Non-government Advisors,” located on the internet at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  Offerors may have access to or may generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution, and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Submit no classified white papers.  Foreign owned firms should contact the contracting officer before submitting a white paper to determine whether you are eligible to receive an award.  For eligibility for award, non-government offerors must also register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database pursuant to Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Subpart 204.73. Any offeror who is not registered may register at http://www.ccr.gov. Alternatively, offerors may phone 1-877-DLA-CALL. Offerors not registered should register immediately. Find Air Force CCR guidance and information at http://www.safaq.hq.af.mil/contracting. Statement of Problem/Objective: Projects proposed under this BAA must address a current or projected HEL capability or enabling technology shortfall that 1) is unique to DEW’s, and 2) that requires advanced development or maturation of some technology to overcome.  Non-HEL programs may also benefit from the technology developed or matured in the proposed project, but clearly delineate the HEL requirement. The Government may consider beyond the scope of this solicitation any proposal that seek to satisfy a HEL requirement by simply combining existing technologies in a novel way via integration or engineering projects,.  Development of technologies that will support the HEL requirements (or reasonable, educated predictions thereof) of general classes of DEW’s particularly interests the Government.Technology development that supports the HEL requirements of a single, specific, active DE acquisition program also interests the government. See areas of potential technology development under this BAA in attachment one. These illustrate the scope of this BAA and indicate broad areas of government interest.  They do not document current technology shortfalls for HEL’s and do not consider them HEL requirements.  Offerors developing white paper proposals under this BAA shall identify HEL requirements sufficiently to support the S&T work they propose.  The HEL JTO encourages multiple submissions in one or more areas you may consider having a high probability of interest to the HEL community.  White paper preparation and submission instructions: Submit firm offers valid for at least 180 days. Prepare separate white papers for each technical area (found above in “Statement of Problem/Objectives”) the offeror is pursuing.   Each white paper must stand on its own merit.  The HEL JTO will use only information provided in a white paper in the evaluation process leading to an oral presentation and award.  Prepare the white paper simply, economically, in accordance with all instructions contained herein, and in any external sources referenced herein.  Convey all required information concisely using straightforward language.  The cost of preparing white papers and oral presentations in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract; but the Government may allow ordinary bid and proposal indirect costs in accordance with FAR 31.205-18.  For the purposes of this solicitation, a white paper shall consist of four parts: 1) a technical section; 2) a ROM cost; 3) a schedule; and 4) resumes. The four components of each white paper shall be recorded on a single CD-R.  The HEL JTO requires no hardcopies. Submit all files in Microsoft Word 6.0 or higher format.  Record all files on the CD-R as distinct documents and properly name.  The typical submission will be a CD-R containing a technical  section in Word format; a ROM cost in Word format; and a schedule in Microsoft Project; and a resume section in Work format. Label a single CD-R containing these files with the lead offeror’s name, project title (to correspond exactly to the project title used on the coversheets of each proposal component and technical area number), and contact information.  Mail or hand-carry the labeled CD-R to the OSD/HEL JTO such that it is received NLT 1600 (Mountain Time) 3 October 2003.  JTO requires no formal transmittal letter. OSD/HEL JTO, Attn:  FY04 BAA Submission I, 901 University Blvd. SE, Suite 100, Albuquerque, NM 87106. The HEL JTO will not evaluate or consider for award white papers sent to any other address or submitted by fax or e-mail.  The HEL  JTO will not accept classified white papers, but offerors must submit a white paper for eligibility for award. A white paper containing data that is not to be disclosed to the public for any purpose or used by the government except for evaluation purposes shall include on its cover page the statement found in paragraph b, chapter 3 (page 6) of the AFRL BAA/PRDA Industry Guide http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/Ind-gde.rtf. Additionally, mark each page containing proprietary or export-controlled data as described also on page 6 of the AFRL BAA/PRDA Industry Guide.  This marking may be in a small font and shall be at the bottom only of each applicable page. Limit the technical and management section to three (3) pages. This page limitation applies to all information comprising the technical/management section except the required cover page, cost, schedule and resumes.  The Government desires no extraneous information (information not explicitly requested in this announcement); do not submit it.   The Government will only read and evaluate the technical section up to the page limitation. The Government will delete pages over the page limitation prior to evaluation.  Allow one-inch margins on each page.  Use elite type size or equivalent (not smaller than 10 point vertical character height and not more than 12 characters per inch).  A 10 point proportional serif font is acceptable, in which case a character per inch measurement does not apply.  Do not typeset or use other techniques to reduce character size or spacing. Each printed side of a sheet counts as a page. With the exception of the page limitation, these format specifications shall apply to the offeror’s SOW. The Government will accomplish evaluation of white papers through a technical peer review of each white paper using the criteria below.  The Government will use no further evaluation criteria to assess the papers.  Organization and clarity of information are critical to all of these evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific/technical merit and soundness of approach of the proposed effort, and its significance to DoD HEL S&T shortfall(s). (2) The innovativeness of the idea(s), approach(es), or procedure(s) proposed, and the balance relative to overall technical and cost/schedule risk.  (3) The offeror’s capabilities including experience, facilities, competence/availability of personnel, and the cost/price of the proposed effort. Find recommended templates for the technical/management section in attachment two, and cost proposal instructions in attachment three. Regardless how the offeror chooses to prepare the white paper, all white papers shall contain the information requested found in attachments and elsewhere herein. The Government encourages open communication between offerors and technical points of contact until submittal of oral briefing charts or cost proposals. Don Seeley, 505.248.8205, serves as the technical point of contact. Thereafter, only the Government should initiate communication for clarification or to notify offerors of time and date for oral presentation.

Statement of Work Life Connections Program:

A. BACKGROUND
In September 2000, the Executive Staff of the Federal Bureau of Prisons approved a concept which would initiate a pilot program of multi faith Residential Life Connections Pre-release Program. This is a voluntary program which will initially be located in five institutions in various regions of the country. The program will be available to men and women inmates.

The program provides inmates with intensive opportunities for spiritual growth and deepening their religious roots by sharing common space and programs for the purpose of personal transformation and reducing recidivism. Inmates will participate in religion specific and inter faith program components designed to bring restoration with God, family, community, and self. The program’s design will increase religious tolerance and respect among inmates of various faiths; will connect each inmate with a spiritual mentor; and will link participants with a faith community at their release destination in order to enhance community reintegration. Another component of the program will initiate specific Victim Impact programs to assist inmates in claiming responsibility for their actions and making amends with victims, family, and community.

The program will enlist partnerships with individuals and organizations in its efforts to lower recidivism and facilitate spiritual growth and personal change. Volunteers, contractors, mentors, sponsoring religious congregations and organizations are all essential partners in the program.

The goal of the Bureau of Prisons Residential Life Connections Pre-release Program is to provide inmates living in a shared living space with intensive opportunities for holistic life restoration for the purpose of reducing recidivism and enhancing prison management.

B.	SUBJECT:
Provide a Spiritual Leader who will provide religious instruction and leadership for inmates participating in the Residential Life Connections Pre-release Program at the Federal Correctional Institution, Milan, Michigan.

C. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:
The services to be provided will be accomplished at:
Federal Correctional Institution
Life Connections Unit
East Arkona Road
Milan, Michigan 48160

D.	SCHEDULE:
The contractor will provide up to eight (15) sessions each week of religious instruction and counseling in conjunction with the core curriculum topics of the Residential Life Connections Program. The contractor will also provide leadership in weekly studies and may be required to lead some HOLY DAY services based on program needs. The schedule may include some weekend and/or evening sessions based on program needs. The breakdown of sessions will be determined locally.

Partial sessions are not authorized, nor will they be reimbursed.  The contractor will not include lunch breaks, travel time, security reasons or other issues as part of a session.  

E.	SUPPLIES:
All supplies that the contractor may routinely need will be provided by the Federal Correctional Institution, Milan, Michigan. These supplies will normally include any materials needed to perform the services covered under this contract. The contractor will pay for their own expenses to attend one planning meeting each year related to the development of the program. The site for this meeting will be determined at a later date.

F.	METHOD OF INSTRUCTION:
The contractor will provide religious instruction based on their own expertise as it relates to the core curriculum materials. The contractor will work closely with the Chaplain Program Manager and other program staff to assist in the development of the program and to gauge the progress of individual participants. Consultations will be held with Life Connections Chaplain Program Manager as needed.  Although the instruction will follow the tenants of the contractor work with participants who follow other faiths or other interpretations may be required.

G. MANAGEMENT:
The contractor will be monitored by the Life Connections Chaplain Program Manager. The contractor will attend all training required by the Bureau of Prisons for contract workers. The contractor will not be permitted to attend institution meetings, staff recalls, or government training sessions for institution staff on contract time or as a consideration of the contract.

The contractor may attend team meetings, departmental meetings, or other meetings relating to the involvement of the services to be provided by terms of the contract. Some meetings will be required and accomplished on contract time.

The contractor will provide a monthly billing statement to the contract monitor that accurately reflects the days of each visit, the number of sessions of each visit, the general content of the sessions, and the total dollar amount due for that month’s sessions.

H.  INSTITUTION SECURITY:
The contractor will adhere to all regulations prescribed by the institution for the safety, conduct and custody of inmates.   The contractor will be in contact with convicted felons and will conduct him/herself in an appropriate manner at all times.  The contractor will report any infractions of the rules and regulations to the staff immediately.

The contractor will attend an orientation program prior to assuming their duties within the institution. Reimbursement is authorized for the time spent in mandatory institution training, prorated hourly, upon completion and clearance of the background checks.   The background checks are outlined in the section entitled contract security.  The list is subject to change at any time.

The government contemplates the award of a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation.

Statement of Work Life Connections Program

A. BACKGROUND
In September 2000, the Executive Staff of the Federal Bureau of Prisons approved a concept which would initiate a pilot program of multi faith Residential Life Connections Pre-release Program. This is a voluntary program which will initially be located in five institutions in various regions of the country. The program will be available to men and women inmates.

The program provides inmates with intensive opportunities for spiritual growth and deepening their religious roots by sharing common space and programs for the purpose of personal transformation and reducing recidivism. Inmates will participate in religion specific and inter faith program components designed to bring restoration with God, family, community, and self. The program’s design will increase religious tolerance and respect among inmates of various faiths; will connect each inmate with a spiritual mentor; and will link participants with a faith community at their release destination in order to enhance community reintegration. Another component of the program will initiate specific Victim Impact programs to assist inmates in claiming responsibility for their actions and making amends with victims, family, and community.

The program will enlist partnerships with individuals and organizations in its efforts to lower recidivism and facilitate spiritual growth and personal change. Volunteers, contractors, mentors, sponsoring religious congregations and organizations are all essential partners in the program.

The goal of the Bureau of Prisons Residential Life Connections Pre-release Program is to provide inmates living in a shared living space with intensive opportunities for holistic life restoration for the purpose of reducing recidivism and enhancing prison management.

B.	SUBJECT:
Provide a Community Liaison  who will assist in the recruitment and training of a broad spectrum of religious congregations and civic organizations to serve as  mentors for inmate participants in the Life Connections Program pilot site at the Federal Correctional Institution in Milan, Michigan.  The relationship between these mentors and the inmate participants will begin early in the incarceration phase of the program and will continue through the duration of the program.  The contractor will promote  the Bureau of Prisons Residential Life Connections Program in the community at large in an effort to recruit and maintain relationships with  mentors.  This is a multi-faith program, so the contractor will be expected to foster relationships with a broad variety of religious communities..

C. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:
The services to be provided will be accomplished FOR:
Federal Correctional Institution Life Connections Unit 4004East Arkona Road Milan, Michigan 48160.  The scope of this position requires contacts with religious congregations and civic organizations in South-east Michigan and North-west Ohio.  The contractor may operate from their home or office location, with the understanding that telephonic contact and on-site visits to the Milan Prison staff are essential to the success of the program. 

D.	SCHEDULE:
Contractor will commit 30 hours each week (15 sessions) to the recruitment, training, coordination, and retention of mentors for the multi-faith Residential Life Connections Program.  The schedule may include some weekend and/or evening hours based on program needs. 

A session is defined as a two (2) hour block of time.   Partial sessions are not authorized, nor will they be reimbursed.  The contractor will not include lunch breaks, travel time, security reasons or other issues as part of a session.  The Contractor will not attend institution or department functions.

E.	SUPPLIES:
All supplies that the contractor may routinely need will be supplied by the contractor.  Travel costs and routine office expenses are the responsibility of the contractor.  These supplies will normally include any materials needed to perform the services covered under this contract.  The contractor will pay for their own expenses to attend one planning meeting each year related to the development of the program.  The site for this meeting will be determined at a later date.  All potential contractors will submit as a part of their quote a detailed estimate of these costs along with a statement indicating what, if any, up front operating costs will be required.

F.	METHOD OF INSTRUCTION:
Selected contractor will be knowledgeable of program goals and will maintain accurate records of all contacts made related to the program.  Once the program is fully operational, there will be approximately 100 inmate participants, each requiring a mentor willing to covenant with the participant through the incarceration phase of the program for one hour per week.  The contractor will work closely with the Chaplain Program Manager and other program staff at the pilot site to ensure that volunteers and mentors from a broad spectrum of religious communities are available to meet the needs of this multi-faith program.

G. MANAGEMENT:
The contract will be monitored by the Life Connections Program Chaplain Manager.  The contractor shall attend all training required by the Bureau of Prisons for contract workers.  The contractor will not be permitted to attend institution meetings, staff recalls, or government training sessions for institution staff on contract time or as a consideration of the contract.

Payment of the contract will be based upon the successful matching of a program participant with a mentor.  This will be documented by a signed agreement with the religious community or civic organization.  Training for the mentors is considered a part of the agreement and must be completed before payment is rendered.

The contractor will provide a monthly billing statement to the contract monitor that accurately documents the contacts made and the total dollar amount due for that months services.

The background checks are outlined in the section entitled contract security.  The list is subject to change at any time.

The government contemplates the award of a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation.  

The resulting contract is not a personnel appointment; therefore, payment is based on the provision of an end product or the accomplishment of a specific service.  The resulting contract does not constitute an employee/employer relationship; therefore, the  contractor will not be subject to government supervision, except for security related matters.
