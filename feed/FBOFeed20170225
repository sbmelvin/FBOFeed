<p>The ETU-111 engine trailer is used to support in the removal/ installation of the engines associated with the KC-135 aircraft. The ETU-111 has a cradle assembly with three adapters that mount to the KC-135 engines. The cradle assembly can be rotated by means or manually cranked gearbox to allow maintenance personnel access to different parts of the engine.</p>
<p>The trailer is used as a multiple-purpose carrier for the KC-135 aircraft engine. This equipment is a four wheeled, pneumatic tired, aluminum framework which can be towed. The trailer carries the KC-135 aircraft engine in a steel cradle that can be rolled up to 74 degrees right and 10 degrees left from level by using a manually cranked gearbox. Due to its use on the KC-135 aircraft and its rugged design for military use, this application is certainly military specific.</p>

<p>I.2. CDC CLAUSES IN FULL TEXT</p>
<p>I.2.1. Evaluation of Contractor Performance (Service) (Jan 2000)</p>
<p>(a) Purpose</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 42.1502, the Contractor's performance will be periodically evaluated by the Government, in order to provide current information for source selection purposes. These evaluations will therefore be marked "Source Selection Information."</p>
<p>(b) Performance Evaluation Period</p>
<p>The Contractor's performance will be evaluated at least annually.</p>
<p>(c) Evaluators</p>
<p>The performance evaluation will be completed jointly by the COR and the Contracting officer.</p>
<p>(d) Performance Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>The contractor's performance will be evaluated in accordance with the attachment listed in Section J titled Performance Evaluation Report.</p>
<p>(e) Contractor Review</p>
<p>A copy of the evaluation will be provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after completion of the evaluation. The contractor shall submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information to the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days after receipt of the evaluation.</p>
<p>(f) Resolving Disagreements Between the Government and the Contractor</p>
<p>Disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation will be reviewed at a level above the Contracting Officer. The ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency. Copies of the evaluation, contractor's response, and review comments, if any, will be retained as part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>(g) Release of Contractor Performance Evaluation Information</p>
<p>The completed evaluation will not be released to other than Government personnel and the contractor whose performance is being evaluated. Disclosure of such information could cause harm both to the commercial interest of the Government and to the competitive position of the contractor being evaluated as well as impede the efficiency of Government operations.</p>
<p>(h) Source Selection Information</p>
<p>Departments and agencies may share past performance information with other Government departments and agencies when requested to support future award decisions. The information may be provided through interview and/or by sending the evaluation and comment document to the requesting source selection official.</p>
<p>(i) Retention Period</p>
<p>The agency will retain past performance information for a maximum period of three years after completion of contract performance for the purpose of providing source selection information for future contract awards.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>I.2.2 Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractor and Contractor Employees (Mar 2006)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall prepare and submit a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to the Contracting Officer prior to access of government information or the commencement of work at CDC.</p>
<p>(b) The NDA made part of this clause, exhibit I and II , is required in service contracts where positions and/or functions proposed to be filled by contractor's employees will have access to non-public and procurement-sensitive information. The NDA also requires contractor's employees properly identify themselves as employees of a contractor when communicating or interacting with CDC employees, employees of other governmental entities (when communication or interaction relates to the contractor's work with the CDC), and members of the public. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.114 (c), states "All contractor personnel attending meetings, answering Government telephones, and working in other situations where their contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the public or Congress that they are Government officials, unless, in the judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves. They must also ensure that all documents or reports produced by contractors are suitably marked as contractor products or that contractor participation is appropriately disclosed."</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall inform employees of the identification requirements by which they must abide and monitor employee compliance with the identification requirements.</p>
<p>(d) During the contract performance period, the Contractor is responsible to ensure that all additional or replacement contractors' employees sign a NDA and it is submitted to the Contracting Officer prior to commencement of their work with the CDC.</p>
<p>(e) Contractor employees in designated positions or functions that have not signed the appropriate NDA shall not have access to any non-public, procurement sensitive information or participate in government meeting where sensitive information may be discussed.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor shall prepare and maintain a current list of employees working under NDAs and submit to the Contracting Officer upon request during the contract period of performance. The list should at a minimum include: contract number, employee's name, position, date of hire and NDA requirement.</p>

Non-public Information<br /><br />[Name of contractor] understands that in order to fulfill the responsibilities pursuant to [Contract name and number] between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and [Name of CDC contractor] dated [date], employees of [contractor] will have access to non-public information, including confidential and privileged information contained in government-owned information technology systems. For purposes of this agreement, confidential information means government information that is not or will not be generally available to the public.

Contractor agrees to submit to the contracting official the original signed copies of NDAs signed by the contractor's employees in accordance with the instructions provided by the contracting official. Failure to provide signed NDAs in accordance with this agreement and instructions provided by the contracting official could delay or prevent the employee from commencing or continuing work at the CDC until such agreement is signed and returned to the contracting official. <br /><br />Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner or to any extent, to any individual other than an authorized Government employee any non-public information that the employee may obtain in connection with the performance of the employee's responsibilities to the CDC. <br /><br />II.

Therefore, if an employee participates in any discussions relating to procurement-sensitive information, assists in developing any procurement-sensitive information, or otherwise obtains any procurement-sensitive information during the course of performing duties at the CDC, contractor understands and agrees that contractor are be excluded from competing for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information.</p>
<p>III. Identification of Non-Government Employees<br /><br />Contractor understands that its employees are not agents of the Government. Therefore, unless otherwise directed in writing by the CDC, contractor agrees to assist and monitor employee compliance with the following identification procedures: <br /><br />A.

<p>Detailed cost analysis will not be conducted for the purposes of awarding a Cooperative Agreement. As requirements and tasking are identified by the Government (and based on the availability of funding), individual orders will be placed against the Cooperative Agreement, whereby the Government will request Cost/Pricing information to assess the realism and reasonableness of costs, including proposed cost sharing. Where a contract award is contemplated, the Government will require elements of cost (labor, subcontractors/consultants, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, escalation, and cost of money) prior to contract award.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PROSPECTIVE AGREEMENT HOLDERS: Current registration in the DoD's System for Award Management (SAM) database is a prerequisite for receiving an award resulting from this BAA. For more information, please contact the Federal Service Desk at 1-866-606-8220 or go to the SAM website at: https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/.</p>
<p>The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-398) required Contractors to submit invoices electronically, and the Department of Defense (DoD) to process electronically, requests for payment under DoD contracts. Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) is a Web-based application that allows DoD Vendors to submit and track their invoices, receipts and acceptance documents electronically. Offerors shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF. For more information, please contact the WAWF Help Desk at 1-800-756-4571, option 6 or go to the WAWF Information website at: http://www.dfas.mil/ecommerce/wawf/info.html</p>
<p>4.1 WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION</p>
<p>No further Request for Information (RFI), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. White papers may be submitted at any time up to the closing date of the BAA. Offerors may submit white papers within one or more of the areas of interest listed in previous paragraphs. However, each area shall be addressed in a separate white paper submission.</p>
<p>White Papers shall be submitted with an original signature of an authorizing official to rebecca.wathen@navy.mil and jeffrey.s.boyce@navy.mil. Proposal submission is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities are encouraged to participate. The NAICS Code for this BAA is 541712.</p>
<p>5. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate white papers responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. White Papers will not be evaluated against each other.</p>
<p>The primary evaluation criteria are:</p>
<p>a) Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which the proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered.</p>
<p>b) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research investigators/personnel, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.<br /><br />6. AWARDS</p>
<p>NAVAIR intends to award Cooperative Agreements and/or contracts and will consider various types of acquisition vehicles including but not limited to traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts or other non-procurement agreements. NAVAIR is planning to make one or more awards within the overall objectives stated in this BAA. All awards will be based on the individual merit of the proposal. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the white papers received in response to this announcement. Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a cooperative agreement and/or contract. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business programs. These efforts shall be conducted primarily at the offeror's site but NAVAIR facilities may also be available and/or used depending on project needs. Access and use of NAVAIR facilities will require security clearances and US citizenship.</p>
<p>NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Modifications to the agreement and/or contract may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting agreement, and therefore will have met the requirements of the Department of Defense Grant and Agreement Regulations (DODGARS) and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), as supplemented.</p>
