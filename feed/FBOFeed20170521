 BACKGROUND
Requirements Development and Management (RDM) Service, under Strategic Investment Management (SIM), Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA)  has a primary responsibility to gather, evaluate, analyze and document clinical and business requirements in support of VHA business users.  RDM provides four (4) functional support roles to SIM, which are described in further detail below: Requirements Analysis, Requirements Elaboration, Field Developed Software, and Tooling Support & Reporting. Technical writing and technical writing reviews of documents, executive-level briefs and communications are also performed in support of these four (4) areas. The technical writing review process for business requirements documentation follows a scorecard methodology that utilizes a separate portion for each level of review.  Once updates to the document have been accepted, it moves on to the next level of review.   

RDM supports Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Program Offices and Veterans Affairs (VA) Offices in the development of business requirements for IT solutions and the management of their requirements.  RDM works collaboratively with other Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA) offices, including Applied Informatics Management (AIM) staff,  AIM acts as an advocate, liaison and facilitator organization that represents VHA in the identification and acquisition of technology enhancements to improve Veteran services.  AIM consists of functional groups that work together to organize current and future business knowledge and provide facilitation/oversight for business users throughout the Information Technology (IT) system s lifecycle.  

A high-level description of the processes and outputs for each of the four (4) functional support areas is described below:

Requirements Analysis   Elicits and guides VHA stakeholders in the definition and documentation of high-level business requirements.  Requests for software or software enhancements are received through the RDM New Service Request (NSR) website portal and are reviewed for completeness by RDM.  The request is then assigned to a Business Analyst, who schedules conference calls with the requester for the purpose of understanding the business needs, and associated risks of not addressing those needs through an IT solution.  All information obtained through requester interviews are documented within the New Service Request Database (NSRD).  The NSRD is a tool used by VHA Program Offices and field staff to enter enhancement requests for current and future IT systems and to obtain up to date status information for requests previously submitted.  This information is then shared with SIM, OIA and Program Office staff, so that they may determine the validity and priority of the request as it relates to VHA and VA Operating Plans, Patient Safety and/or support of core application processes.  The database also includes linkages to databases maintained and supported outside of RDM, such as Business Architecture Repositories.  Business needs are then documented within the requirements repository, IBM  Rational Requirements Composer (RRC), and attributes are assigned to each business need, including the level of Program Office support and associated Operating Plans (Level 1).  RRC is a tool that allows analysts to document and track IT business requirements in support of software development.  The tool provides an Enterprise-wide view, strategic traceability, visibility into reuse of existing requirements and dependencies of VHA IT requirements.  Periodically, the AIM Portfolio Managers will work with the Program Offices to evaluate the business needs in the requirements repository RRC, and a decision will be made to further the analysis for a set of business needs.  In those instances, the selected business needs will be refined into owner requirements through a series of stakeholder meetings.  Likewise, owner requirements are populated into the requirements repository (RRC) and are associated to the business need to allow for traceability of requirements.  RDM staff aggregate the business and owner requirements into a Business Requirements Document (BRD).  BRDs are used to guide and support business decisions to fund IT projects (Level 2).  SIM is currently offering Business Case Analysis (BCA) services to support VHA Program Offices as they perform their analysis and documentation of potential investments related to VHA IT systems and portfolios.  RDM Business Case Analyses do not contemplate the cost of the work effort, but more the potential benefit to the Government should the decision be made by VA to fund the solution.  Therefore, the RDM BCA template follows industry standards, but will require specialized tailoring in terms of cost.  

Requirements Elaboration   Develops detailed business requirements for approved/funded IT solutions. During Requirements Elaboration, the Business Analysts (typically a facilitator and note taker) conduct a series of meetings with the stakeholders defined within the BRD, as well as other Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) that the stakeholders may identify.  Through these stakeholder meetings, the Business Analysts begin the process of refining the business needs and owner requirements identified within the BRD.  The Business Analysts develop Business Use Cases and detailed business requirements ( System Shall  statements/capabilities) and work collaboratively with the VHA OIA SIM Business Architecture Analysts who provide oversight and support for associated architectural modeling.  

Once the Business Analysts have stakeholder approval of the Business Use Cases, all  system shall  statements/capabilities are documented in the requirements repository (currently RRC) and are associated with the higher-level owner requirements to allow for continued traceability (Level 3).  A Requirements Elaboration Document (RED) is created in Rational ClearCase by the Business Analyst that contains the detailed business requirements, Business Use Cases, architectural models and the traceability matrix.  

RDM is also supporting the requirements development efforts for the VistA Evolution (VE) project. The requirements for these efforts are being captured in an integrated Business Requirements Document (iBRD), which includes high level and detailed business requirements.

Field Developed Software (FDS)   Supports business assessments of VHA innovation efforts by enabling the field to promote locally developed, innovative, value-add products for national use which has made the Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA) so successful.

VHA innovation efforts in the field have resulted in the development of locally developed and deployed software products, herein called Class III.  Often the benefit of the local solution is one that is desired on a more global basis.  Previously, local Medical Centers have had the ability to directly export their products to other facilities.  Recently, the process for sharing Class III products has become more restrictive in order to ensure the integrity and reliability of the VistA databases.  Therefore, when a Class III product is desired to be released and supported on a national basis (herein referred to as Class I), the product must be evaluated and certified through an open source certifying agent that it will do no harm.  The FDS Business Analyst is responsible for the business assessment of the product that will aid the Program Office and business owners in determining the value of the Class III product for national deployment.  A BRD is completed as an output of the analysis.  An inventory of Class III products has been developed to store information on the multiple products maintained in the field and is updated by the FDS team members.   

Tooling Support & Reporting   Supports the NSRD (and RRC) tool. 
The NSRD is a series of interconnected web forms that allow the Business Analysts to enter data that supports the processing of requests entered through the NSR webportal.  The NSRD provides reports to SIM and AIM on each of the requests submitted and provides the customer-base with a single portal to review past requests and obtain information about the status of open requests.  The database also includes linkages to databases maintained and supported outside of RDM, such as Business Architecture Repositories.
