<DESC>The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, is soliciting proposals to 1) address the relationship between the presence of congenital CMV (cytomegalovirus) and long-term audiologic/otologic outcome, and 2) address the clinical validity and utility of CMV screening in the detection of permanent hearing impairment in the newborn, as well as the prediction of hearing impairment with onset during infancy or in the early years of life. The goals are to correlate CMV status at birth with the presence of permanent and/or progressive sensorineural hearing loss; to acquire information on the incidence, time course and audiologic outcomes of CMV related hearing loss; and to determine the extent to which CMV screening can improve detection and predictions of either existing or progressive hearing loss if combined with physiological metrics already in use for newborn hearing screening.   A seven-year, cost-reimbursement type contract is anticipated, with award made on or about September 30, 2004. The solicitation will be issued on or about July 16, 2003, and will be posted on this Web site and at http://ocm.od.nih.gov/drc/rfp.htm. Offerors are responsible for routinely checking these Web sites for any amendments to the solicitation. Proposals will be due 120 days after the date of issuance of the solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government. See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to enter into a contract for research services to provide export assistance to the Bureau’s International Price Program in the development of new procedures for handling pricing of intra-company transfers.  Incumbent will also ensure that indexes are based on sound economic and statistical principles and consistent with the use of these series.  Total cost for this requirement is NTE $12,000.00.  

	This project is being established to help ensure that the process and procedures currently in place to price this critical component of U.S. trade are properly grounded in economic theory, appropriate to use to determine a deflator, and consistent with price index number theory.  These procedures must take into account the variety of industrial organizational models at play in intra-firm trade, including imperfect competition (monopolistic competition and oligopolies) and perfectly competitive markets.  
	
	DESCRIPTION:    
	
I.  Objectives  
	The purpose of this project is to provide expert assistance to the Bureau in reviewing the proposed new procedures for collecting intra-company transfer price data.  These data are critical to the construction and publication of the U.S. Export and Import Price Indexes.  
	
II.  Description and Scope of Work  

In order to ensure the project will be of practical use to the Bureau, researcher will be expected to confer with William Alterman of the Bureau’s Division of International Prices.  In addition, all topics for research and analysis should be approved by Mr. Alterman.   Mr. Alterman will be responsible for ensuring researcher’s requests for any empirical analysis based on the IPP database will be completed and distributed as quickly as reasonably possible.  

This research should focus on answering 2 questions:  

1.  Are the proposed procedures for the collection of prices in intra-firm trade consistent with sound economic and index number theory?  
2.  Are these procedures particularly consistent in light of the significant volume of trade that is associated with firms operating under imperfect (e.g. monopolistic) competition.  
3.   Are fallback procedures consistent with the Program’s need to maximize the likelihood of collecting usable data.  

This project requires an individual who has worked extensively with transfer prices from both a conceptual and operational perspective, and who demonstrates a detailed knowledge of IPP’s data collection procedures.  

This review will be carried out over the following period:   July 7, 2003 to September 30,  2003.  

III.  Inspection and Acceptance  
	Final inspection and acceptance of the research paper called for in the project will be made by designated staff of the Office of Prices and Living Conditions.  

All interested parties may express their interest to the Point of Contact (designated below) by the due date of this notice, either by e-mail or facsimile on 202-691-6026.  Correspondence must reference the number for this posting.  Affirmative written responses must be received by the due date.

<DESC>The National Park Service intends to issue a concession prospectus within the next 14 days for the continuation of Floatplane Transportation Service at Isle Royale National Park. Primary concession services are a seasonal operation of a public reservation (on-demand) Floatplane air transportation service between the Houghton, Michigan area and two locations within Isle Royale National Park - Tobin Harbor (adjacent to Rock Harbor Lodge area), and Washington Harbor (adjacent to the Windigo Ranger Station).  Daily service must be provided between the middle of May to the end of September, weather permitting, during the months of June, July, and August.  This business opportunity is for on-demand transportation only.  Due to the park's wilderness designation and noise impacts to wilderness users and wildlife, aerial charter and/or sightseeing tours are not a part of this business opportunity.  Isle Royale, and its 400 neighboring islands, forms an archipelago in the Michigan waters of Lake Superior adjacent to the international boundary with Canada. The park is about 50 miles north of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula, 13 miles from Ontario, and 18 miles from the north shore of Minnesota.  The annual gross receipts for the past few years have been between $130,000-$163,000.  The average annual visitation to the park is approximately 17,000 visitors annually.  The new concession contract will be for 10 years.  Further details are available in the Prospectus.  The National Park Service has determined, in accordance with 36 CFR Part 51, Subpart F, that the new concession contract is a qualified concession contract as the anticipated annual gross receipts are not expected to exceed $500,000.  However, no existing concessioner is present and there is not a Preferred Offeror for this contract - the contract will be awarded to the party submitting the best offer.  Any offer must be received in the Concession Management Office of the National Park Service in Omaha, Nebraska, Midwest Regional Office, 1709 Jackson Street, Omaha, NE  68102 no later than 4:00 p.m. on the response date shown above, in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract to provide visitor services in Isle Royale National Park.

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE procurement.  This procurement is planned to be a SOLE SOURCE contract award to the UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a SOLE SOURCE contract to the University of Texas, for  “Enhancement of the TEXAS Model for Simulating Intersection Collisions, Driver Interaction with Messaging and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Sensors”.  Under that SOLE SOURCE contract, the University of Texas will:  (a) use the TEXAS model to accurately simulate crashes of vehicles; (b) provide tools for modeling interactions between the driver and the traffic control system during the period just prior to the crash; and (c) measure the vehicle’s actions with high fidelity ITS sensors.  The Texas model was developed by the University of Texas for the State of Texas for detailed traffic analysis of single intersections and diamond interchanges.  The TEXAS model is unique in that it follows the individual vehicle trajectories through the intersection, whereas conventional operations-oriented simulation models simply graphically lay out those trajectories in the animations but do not model the vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-geometrics interactions within the intersection “box”.  The TEXAS model is unique in that the curve radii and vehicle turn characteristics affect the traffic performance and interactions of the vehicles.  The University of Texas employs the individuals who originally conceived and programmed the Texas model, and the university also employs at least one person who has worked on many traffic engineering projects using the TEXAS model; those persons are the most familiar with the TEXAS model’s source code, and they can most accurately create new vehicle characteristics needed for the collision features of this forthcoming project; those individuals are uniquely qualified to update and modify the TEXAS model to meet the intersection collision avoidance needs of the FHWA’s Research and Development.   Moreover, the TEXAS model’s source code belongs to the University of Texas.  The result is that the University of Texas and its cognizant staff are uniquely qualified to modify the TEXAS source code for the FHWA’s collision avoidance needs.  Additionally, the University of Texas has agreed to put a copy of the TEXAS model’s source code into the Open Software Foundation’s General Public License at the end of this forthcoming project, so that it can be used by other research universities, by states, and by the federal government in future research projects.  Developing a NEW single-intersection model from scratch with such capabilities and with rights in the open source domain would be estimated to cost several million dollars----a sum far exceeding the estimated cost of the intended SOLE SOURCE contract with the University of Texas.   Therefore, it is in the Federal Government’s cost effective best interest to award this contract to the University of Texas.  Any interested organization may attempt to prove its capability to competitively perform this forthcoming project, by submitting one complete hard original and seven complete hard copies of a Statement of Qualifications to the following address, for a mandatory ARRIVAL at the following address AND in the following ROOM NUMBER not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time on July 23, 2003:  James H. Mowery III, Negotiator, Office of Acquisition Management (HAAM-30D), Federal Highway Administration, Room 4410, 400 Seventh Street, S. W., Washington, D. C. 20590.   Documents sent to that address by means of the U. S. postal service often encounter delays of many days before arriving in that Room 4410, because of enhanced security-screening procedures instituted after the terrorist attacks.  The FHWA does NOT plan to issue any separate SOLICITATION for this project.  Therefore, any organization desiring to submit a Statement of Qualifications shall compile it by using the information given in this Pre-Solicitation Notice.

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) awarded contract N01-LM-9-3531 on September 28, 1999, to General Electric Corporate Research and Development, One Research Circle, Niskayuna, New York, 12309 to assist in the development of an application programmer interface (API) known as the Insight Toolkit (ITK), and first implementation of a Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (SRT).  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate with General Electric Corporate Research and Development on a sole source basis to extend the current contract number N01-LM-9-3531 for twelve months to continue the overall goals of the project, which include streamlining the existing ITK code, improving the consistency of the internal software architecture, extending documentation of the existing algorithms and methods, and generating examples suitable for inclusion in courseware and educational materials associated with ITK.  General Electric Corporate Research and Development is currently providing the required services, and will continue to participate in a design review of the ITK software, to improve, support, expand and rework DART, the internet-based, distributed regression testing structure of ITK, to accommodate acceptance testing of consortium contributed and publicly contributed code (including style, test coverage, and documentation as well as develop a mechanism to produce an electronic software acceptance ticket), and to demonstrate the integration of ITK with other visualization software through publishable examples.  General Electric Corporate Research and Development has been performing the required services for the past three and a half years under the current contract.  This requirement represents a continuation of the services they are currently providing to the NLM.  By virtue of their expertise and experience gained through their development and implementation under the current contract, General Electric Corporate Research and Development is uniquely qualified and the only source capable of carrying out these required services in the required time frame and without duplication of cost to the government and undue delays.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  Based on authority cited in 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)), award to General Electric Corporate Research and Development without full and open competition is planned.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>ACQUISITON OF HANDHELD MINE DETECTORS The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida (NSWCDDCSS), intends to award a sole-source firm-fixed price Simplified Acquisition for 18 each F1A4 Mine Detectors and 12 each F3 Mine Detectors from Minelab Electronics, Torrensville, Australia. The Mine Detectors will be provided to the U.S. Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory for experimentation in land mine countermeasures tactics development. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The U.S. Army recently evaluated the mine detectors manufactured by Minelab, Inc. against other similar products and found they have highly desirable performance and highly desirable physical / ergonomic characteristics as follows: (a)	Capable of operating in the high-ferrous content soils with no loss of sen sitivity (b)	A built in speaker that is active at all times and can be heard by the operator and the supervisor (c)	A search pattern which is maximized by being cylindrical in shape for full ground coverage, not conical, as mines could easily be missed (d)	Capable of detecting all types of mines, both metal and minimum metal, buried at the maximum operational depth, in all soil conditions (e)	Control box and/or batteries mountable either on the detector shaft or on the operator’s belt or shoulder (f)	Cable leading to the search head enclosed along the length of the shaft to prevent damage (g)	No loss in sensitivity through the life of the batteries (h)	No sensitivity or volume controls that would allow the operator to reduce the sensitivity of the detector and accidentally put himself in a dangerous situation (i)	Capable of detecting a Type 72A AP mine at a depth of 15  cm – 19 cm in typical lateritic soil condition (j)	Capable of detecting a Type PMN-2 AP mine at a depth of 24 cm – 27 cm (k)	Differentiating between two metal targets that are 10 cm apart The detection capabilities (particularly in a soil with high mineral and metal content) of primary interest to the USMC are due to a unique technology developed by Minelab, Inc. This technology is known as Multi Period Sensing (MPS). MPS produces a series of wide and narrow pulses that are transmitted into the ground from the coil. After each pulse, a metal target will provide a response that will decay over time. Through electronic sampling of the decayed responses, it is possible to identify a soil response from a metal target response. Once identified, the mine detector electronics can eliminate the response from the soil and continue to detect only the response from the metal target w ithout any loss in detector sensitivity. Thus only the Minelab mine detectors, based on proprietary technology, will meet the USMC requirements. MineLab is also the mine detector providor for the new AN/PSS-14 mine detector for the US Army and USMC.  Although production AN/PSS-14s are currently not available, the current MineLab offerings provide a commonality of components.  Based on the results of the U.S. Army evaluation, the need to standardize the logistics/supply requirements between the two services, the performance, and the use of proprietary technology to achieve the performance, it is essential that these items be obtained from Minelab, Inc.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. However, for those interested in this acquisition, request the complete performanced-based Statement of Work (PBSOW). The Request For Quotation (RFQ) Number is NAMA-03-Q-0007. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12. The requirement is a 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 512191 and the Small Business Size Standard is $25 Million. All responsible small business sources may submit a quote that will be considered by NARA. The purchase order will be for a period of one year (12 months). CLIN 0001 Lot prices for all U. S. Air Force 12" analog Videodisc platter images and conversion of each image to either: CLIN 0001AA 1024x768 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor; or CLIN 0001AB 800x600 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor. Note: The actual conversion project will be to convert the images to either CLIN 0001AA or CLIN 0001AB which will be determined by NARA based on the quotes received. The delivery date will be six months after contract award. Place of delivery and acceptance will be National Archives and Records Administration, Special Media Archives Division (NWCS-S), Room 5360, 3301 Metzerott Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, f.o.b. destination.CLIN 0002 Other Direct Costs. The following CLINs are Optional and may or may not be exercised by NARA during the period of performance. CLIN 0003 Lot prices for all U. S. Forest Service 12" analog Videodisc platter images and conversion of each image to either: CLIN 0003AA 1024x768 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor; or CLIN 0003AB 800x600 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor. Note: The actual conversion project will be to convert the images to either CLIN 0003AA or CLIN 0003AB which will be determined by NARA based on the quotes received. The delivery date will be six months after the option is exercised. CLIN 0004 Other Direct Costs. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to award a purchase order for Analog Videodisc Image Conversion to Digital Format. The Contractor must convert an estimated 152,857 U. S. Air Force analog images, currently stored on 3 sides of two 12" analog videodisk platters, from the holdings of the Still Picture LICON of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA-NWCS-Stills). The analog videodisk images to be digitized are finding aids for the prints, negatives and positives in Record Group 342, Records of USAF Commands, Activities and Organizations, Series FH. The analog images are divided among several segments covering different historical periods. The finding aid databases that track the images on the videodiscs and allow for subject and item-level access to specific images are currently in MS Access97.  All the functionality that now exists for those databases must be preserved.  The databases delivered to NARA must remain in MS Access97.  There are three databases: USAFMAIN, AFCOLOR, and USAFCAPS. A preliminary analysis of the three databases undertaken by NARA and the fields they contain is attached to this PBSOW.  The Contractor must undertake its own analysis to make sure that it has a thorough knowledge of what each database contains, what fields are in the databases, and what type of information is in each field.  Of the three databases, the USAFMAIN is the most used database. This database is currently used to convert the videodisk side and image numbers assigned by the creator of the discs and databases, to USAF original negative numbers.  Many researchers who contact NARA seeking copies of USAF images, have seen the images on a videodisk, and only have the videodisk location numbers to identify the image(s) that they want copied.  However, the USAF Negative numbers are required to retrieve the original negatives or prints for making copies.  Therefore, reproductions cannot be made until NARA is able to determine the original negative number from the corresponding videodisk location number in the database.  This prime functionality must be maintained and enhanced to allow NARA or its researchers to locate the USAF negative number or the videodisc image number on the DVD+R.  (See Attachment 1to the PBSOW for definitions) When a user provides any one of the three numbers (USAF, Videodisk or DVD+R), the database modified by the Contractor must be able to retrieve the two other corresponding numbers.  For example, if a user provides the videodisk number, the modified database must be able to retrieve and display the corresponding USAF negative number and the image number on the DVD+R. The Contractor must convert an estimated 47,801 U. S. Forest Service analog images, currently stored on one-side of one 12" analog videodisc platter, from the holdings of the Still Picture LICON of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA-NWCS-Stills). The analog videodisc images to be digitized are finding aids for the negatives and positives in Record Group 95 (Records of USFS), Series G (General browsing file).  The analog images are divided among several subject categories. Each of the Title Frames was shot 4-5 times, in order for them to show up when scanning the videodisk at high speeds.  These multiple frame entries will be maintained during the conversion project. In addition, the USFS videodisc has many blank frames, which will be left in during this process as well. The database associated with this disc is currently non-useable.  The database was created in C-Quest Photo Finder, a DOS application.  The database was backed up by the National Agricultural Library staff utilizing a MS-DOS Backup.com application in October of 1992 onto 4-5.25" floppy disks for the Dictionary Files, and 16-5.25" floppy disks with Names Data Files.  NARA has the C-Quest application disk, but requires that these floppy disks be restored with an appropriate RESTORE.COM application, in order to utilize the files on the floppies.  Once the C-quest database can be reconstructed, NARA must be able to export the caption data to an ASCII delimited file, and then import the data into a MS-ACCESS97 database.  This database will then need to be modified to reflect the DVD+R disc and file name for each of the included digital files. The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant fixed price purchase order. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition as well as any addenda to the provision. Note: Offerors that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation, may be excluded from consideration. The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items also applies. The following evaluation factors, in descending order of importance, will be used in awarding the acquisition: (1) past performance and (2) technical capability (subfactors are procedures, equipment availability, and technical personnel expertise/experience) as compared to price. Award will be based on a best value determination, price and other factors considered. The Offeror should include a completed copy of Provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications- Commercial Items with its quote. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items, with the previously referenced PBSOW as its addendum, applies to this acquisition. Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Paragraph (b) of this clause incorporates by reference the following FAR clauses: 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Viet Nam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Viet Nam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans, 52.225-1 Buy American Act Supplies, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration. A completed ACH Form must be on file prior to contract award. The Offeror must provide past relevant experience on related or similar Federal, State and local Government, and private contracts and subcontracts it has held within the last five years and all contracts and subcontracts currently in progress which are of similar scope, magnitude and complexity to that which is detailed in this RFQ. The information must be clear whether the work by the Offeror was done as a prime Contractor or a subcontractor. The Government may make award without discussions-therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best pricing.  Any amendments hereby issued to this solicitation shall be synopsized in the same manner as this solicitation and must be acknowledged by each offeror. Offerors are requested to transmit inquiries via email to marion.bassdyer@nara.gov or mail via 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 3360. College Park, MD 20740.

<DESC>Synopsis for DRAFT PRDA Announcement
IHPRPT X  PRDA 03-02-PKT

THIS IS A DRAFT PROGRAM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ANNOUNCEMENT (PRDA) ONLY.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this DRAFT PRDA is to obtain market research on the details for the final announcement.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.  Information will be released in sections.  Therefore, entities who wish to participate in this market research should maintain an awareness of this website.

The Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program continues to be a vital Department of Defense / National Aeronautics and Space Administration (DoD/NASA) and industry effort.  IHPRPT was established to strengthen the technology base of the DoD and commercial rocket propulsion systems through the development of advanced, innovative rocket propulsion technology.

The Government is considering a new Upper Stage Engine Technology (USET) effort.  The objective of this effort is to pursue the IHPRPT upper stage engine goals through improved concurrent engineering and management tools.  This will be achieved in a three part approach consisting of tool improvement/development, implementation, and validation.  The implementation and validation will be accomplished through the design, fabrication, and test of either a hydrogen turbopump or a combustion chamber, or both.

Legitimate entities capable of receiving ITAR restricted information and interested in participating in this market research should attend an Industry Day to be held at AFRL/PRS, Edwards AFB, CA on Thursday 29 May 03.  Only U.S. contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (800-352-3572) that have a legitimate business purpose or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors will be allowed to attend.  If you are registered with the DLSC, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your visit request to 1Lt Daniel Wright (661-275-5583) no later than 22 May 03.

Discussion topics may include: 1) clarity and content of topic description, 2) clarity and relevance of evaluation criteria, 3) amount and distribution of funding, 4) period of performance for basic and options, 5) oral presentation guidance, and 6) proposal timeline.

<DESC>58 - The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has a requirement to procure up to ten each Digital Video Broadcast Server (DVBS), Engineering Development Models (EDMs) for testing in other than laboratory environments.  DVBS is a Ka/Ku wideband receiver, weighing less than 10 lbs, and is .2 cubic feet (8.5" X 7.6" X 4.1"). The Government intends to purchase these DVBS’s awarding a firm fixed priced contract using sole source procedures.  The authority cited for this procurement is 10 USC 2304C(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1; Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Request for Proposal for this acquisition is USZA22-03-R-0033.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334220 with a small business size standard of 750 employees. The EDMs will use NSA certified external decryption capabilities.  These units will simultaneously provide classified video and audio, unclassified video and audio, and data.  Received data can be reassembled into stored files and made available via its server capability over a network.  A web based user interface allows DVBS to connect to a variety of operator workstations.  Based on a Market Investigation it appears that the only source that can satisfy this requirement is Raytheon Systems, 7700 Arlington Boulevard, Falls Church, VA.  See numbered note 22.  Questions from industry should be directed to the attention of Mr. Marc Duval, duvalm@socom.mil, 813-281-0560 ext 304.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

C.  Incidental services, e.g., AutoCAD drafting and 3D modeling, GIS, Microsoft Word processing, etc., may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements.    PRIMARY SERVICES:  For the purpose of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily:  A.  Project Planning and Compliance Services; B.  Pre-design Services including programming, site analysis, and supplementary services; C.  Design Services including schematic design, value analysis, design development, construction documents, and construction support; D.  Construction Management Services. COORDINATION:  The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm(s) or in conjunction with subconsultants.  The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN: The U. S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design, and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities.  Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. EXECUTIVE ORDER: In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all Federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement.  The Government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is, a clause holding the firm harmless will not be included in the contract. CONTRACT PERIOD:  All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract.  The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed price or not-to-exceed type task orders.  The maximum ordering limitation will be $5,000,000.00 for the life of the contract. Each task order will not exceed $500,000.00.  The $5,000,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread out over the life of the contract including all option years.  The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Statements of Qualifications will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: A.  Demonstrated ability and experience in the type of projects required under this contract, particularly small projects, in various climatic regions (i.e., high  mountain, heavy snow areas, arid deserts and coastal, urban and remote areas); and specific past performance records on previous architect-engineering work performed for Federal, State, and local government agencies, and private industry documenting the quality of the firm's work and the firm's history of meeting performance schedules and budgets. B.  Demonstrated experience with integrated design, with an emphasis on coordinated multidisciplinary teams, establishment of up-front environmental goals, whole systems approach and follow-through.  Demonstrated records of the firm's ability to communicate, coordinate, facilitate, and work expeditiously with multiple entities including Federal, State, and local agencies and other involved concerns. C.  Demonstrated specialized experience and technical competence in preparing designs for facilities that minimize the use of, and the environmental impact on, the earth's renewable and non-renewable resources (forest, grasslands, water, solar energy, wind energy, etc.) and to the earth's managed resources.  This includes, to the maximum extent practicable, specifying the use of recycled content material and recovered materials, and providing designs for construction that promote energy conservations, pollution prevention, waste reduction.  Emphasis will focus on familiarity with and project experience in applying principles of sustainability in various climatic regions (for example, high mountains, heavy snow areas, arid deserts, and permafrost) for the types of projects described and utilization of appropriate materials and construction techniques, with sensitivity to natural and cultural resources, as well as aesthetic considerations appropriate for National Park settings.  D.  Demonstrated professional qualifications of individuals listed to perform under the contract, including individual licenses, certifications, and experience in the work proposed.   E.  Ability and capacity to respond to expanded or multiple task orders on short notice and within the established schedules, while maintaining a high standard of quality and controlling costs. In addition to other factors, offers will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (i.e. multiple awards).  The Government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is no clause holding the firm harmless will be included in the contract.     SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS Eligible HUBZone firms that fully meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a Letter of Interest and completed Standard Forms 254 for each firm, a Team Standard Form 255, and an organization chart, all in an original only, i.e., no additional copies are required.

<DESC>Revision 2:  Please note a change to the point of contact information.  All other information remains the same. Revision 1: This announcement is extended for 30 days.  All other information remains the same. This announcement is an advance notice to industry that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently working on a buy for data display systems.  In order to provide industry with appropriate documents for future proposal submittals, the FAA plans to release to industry a draft requirements document and statement of work to solicit comments and recommendations from industry.  The FAA plans to release this request for comments and recommendations within the next 30-90 days.   This announcement is intended to alert you to watch for this FAA draft for industry comments.  Industry is encouraged to monitor the FAA Contracts Opportunity web page for the release of these draft documents.  This is an advanced notice only.  If you are not already signed up for the notice of change to the FAA Contracts Opportunity web page, you are encouraged to do so.   For those of you who are not familiar with the FAA data display systems planned buy, as set out in our market survey of 9/02, below is a synopsis of the requirements.  The FAA Data Display System (FAADDS) is proposed as the FAAs next generation data display system.  FAADDS will provide rapid retrieval and display of a wide range of weather, operational support, and administrative data to air traffic controllers in Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs) and Terminal Radar Approach Controls (TRACONS), as well as in other FAA and non-FAA facilities.  Information will be displayed in formats and with contents designed for rapid operator understanding and assimilation with minimum human interaction.  The system will interface with a large number of FAA systems to receive information for display.  Information displayed will be identical in content and format to the source document or display.   The system will be comprised of workstations networked together in local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs) to provide shared information management and display.   The system will be scalable in order to meet the information display needs of the full spectrum of facilities from very large to small terminal areas.  The system will be comprised of commercial off-the shelf (COTS) and non-developmental item (NDI) hardware and software to facilitate configuration control, maintenance, training, and system upgrade by Government personnel.  The Government intends to procure data rights necessary for itself or third parties to maintain and enhance the software.

<DESC>LifeLog BAA 03-30 Task 2 requires that "offerors must also address human subject approval, data privacy and security, copyright, and legal considerations that would affect the LifeLog development process." The purpose of this modification is to reiterate this requirement and to provide clarification guidance regarding the capture by LifeLog sensors of imagery and audio of people other than the user of the LifeLog system, and to extend the initial due date for proposals. 
LifeLog researchers shall obey all applicable privacy laws and regulations, and shall avoid even the appearance of the invasion of privacy. LifeLog physical data capture systems shall allow the LifeLog user to dynamically activate and deactivate the recording of audio and video, independent of data stream processing such as using optical flow or ambient light and noise to measure motion or transitions between indoors and outdoors. LifeLog researchers shall not capture imagery or audio of any person without that person's a priori express permission. In fact, it is desired that capture of imagery or audio of any person other than the user be avoided even if a priori permission is granted.
The due date for proposals to be considered during the intial evaluation phase is extended from Friday, June 23, 2003, to Monday, July 14, 2003, at 12:00 NOON (ET).

Drilling and blasting will not be allowed under this contract.  Two disposal areas will be available for placement of dredged material: a) an approved ocean disposal area located no more than 16 nautical miles south of Key West, and b) an upland site lo cated on Fleming Key with at least 37 acres available to the contractor for construction of an upland containment and de-watering site.

All other material may be placed in the ocean disposal area.  The contractor should expect that close coordination with environmental agencies will be required when placing pipeline within the approved corridor so that impacts to environmental resources can be avoided.

The Contracting Officer will use a trade-off process to determine which offer represents the best value to the Government.

I. INTRODUCTION.  The Radio Frequency (RF) Sensors Division of the Avionics Department of NAWCAD Patuxent River, Maryland is soliciting proposals for research in technologies that are applicable to RF Sensor Systems for Navy aircraft.

II. BACKGROUND.  The RF Sensors Division continues developing advanced systems and technologies for Naval Aviation.  Many areas of application include Synthetic Aperture Radar, Multi-function Radar, advanced antennas, image & data processing, and communications.  The RF Sensors Division continues to develop advanced capabilities to reduce the cost of transitioning technology into the Fleet.

III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST.  This BAA is to solicit technical/cost proposals for research support in technologies that are applicable to Radio Frequency (RF) Sensor systems for Navy Aircraft. Major areas of interest include  (1) Signal Processing, (2) Antennas and Propagation, (3) Information Processing, (4) Devices and Materials, (5) Radar and RF Communications Systems Engineering Methodologies, and (6) Aircraft Installation Technologies. New, innovative and creative approaches to technical problems that significantly advance radar and RF Communication system performance and improve aircraft installations are sought. Among the primary interest areas are AEW radar operating at UHF through L band and S-band, tactical radar operating at C, X, and Ku bands, synthetic aperture radar operating in X-, C-, L-, and UHF-bands, and C3I systems operating at any radio frequency throughout the spectrum. Examples of technologies include, but are not limited to, antennas, antenna array concepts, electronically scanned arrays, conformal arrays, radomes, propagation, scattering, and diffraction, rough surface scattering, computational electromagnetics (with emphasis on antenna design and antenna-platform interaction), phased array antenna concepts, electronically scanned arrays, devices and materials, remote sensor telemetry and miniaturized RF telecommunication transceivers, optical components/fiber  optics, photonics and monolithic microwave integrated circuits,  high power broadband T/R modules and associated subassembly/device  technologies, direct digital synthesis exciter concepts, space-time  adaptive processing (STAP) techniques for circular arrays,  massively parallel processing architectures for multi-channel  STAP, software engineering, advanced signal processing of synthetic  aperture radar data, advanced image processing, data and image exploitation, moving target imaging techniques, automatic  target recognition and classification, advanced signal  processing concepts for multi-mode sensor operation, and equipment installation techniques solutions. 

IV. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE. NAWCAD is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions).  Other Transactions will be entered into under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research, or by contacting Ben Hansford at (301) 342-5738 or by e-mail at hansfordbj@navair.navy.mil.  Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.

NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project.  Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, and should address funding periods of performance.  Formal work breakdown structures and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired, however, NAVAIR reserves the right the request this information for proposals using FAR/DFARS type contracts. Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order: 

Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of 
the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the Statement of Work and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see above); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing. 
Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors? cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? 
Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement.  The offeror shall present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made. 
Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements. 


VI. EVALUATION CRITERIA. The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement.  The merit of the proposal shall be determined based on the following criteria listed in order of importance: 

(1) The Offeror's ability to demonstrate feasibility and potential contributions of the effort to DOD priorities in RF Sensor related technologies; 

(2) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; 

(3) The Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives; 

(4) Proposed cost, adjusted for cost realism; 

(5) The Offeror's past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort; and 

(6) Socio-economic merits (contracts only).  For awards to be made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, HUB zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns, service disable veteran-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCU/MI).  

III. AWARDS.  NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated above (See para. II). All awards will be based on merit competition. The Government reserves the right to select all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations.  There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the contracting officer, and the total exceeds $500,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.

<DESC>Cancer Information Service----
Concept for 2004------
The draft concept for the next cycle of the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Information Service contracts published in FedBizOpps on May 21, 2003 elicited numerous comments and questions.  This updated concept document incorporates additional information on the concept and serves as a general response to the most frequently cited concerns and questions.   THIS DOCUMENT IS PUBLISHED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  COMMENTS ARE NOT BEING CONSIDERED AT THIS TIME.  No response to this announcement is necessary.  ---------
-----------Background-----------
The Cancer Information Service (CIS) is the National Cancer Institutes  (NCIs) communications network for the public.  The program is operated through contracts competitively awarded every five years.  New contracts will be awarded to commence operations on October 15, 2004.  As the NCI Cancer Information Service Office prepares for re-competition of its Cancer Information Service regional contracts, two divergent but equally important priorities are apparent.  A new concept for the program must retain current, valuable regional partnerships developed with key stakeholders over the 2 previous contracting cycles (13 years).  Changes to the current network configuration could destroy the credibility the program has worked hard to establish and ultimately damage NCIs influence with regional partners and in State Cancer Control Planning activities. At the same time, the need to maintain the CIS regional presence must be balanced with the imperative to hold the line on program costs and utilize technological advances that enable an efficient and economical operation of the CIS Information Service ---------
CIS 2004--------------------
The following is a concept for the next 5-year CIS contract period (2004-2009).  The concept is based on two factors: cancer health disparities and advances in technology.  The CIS Partnership Program is currently addressing the critical issue of cancer health disparities successfully.  The Partnership Program collaborates with partner organizations to reach minority and medically underserved populations and populations with limited access to health and cancer information.  Consolidation of CIS telecommunication operations will reduce duplication of effort and maximize program resources.  Use of new systems technology will enhance efficiency and quality of program operations. ----------
In the proposed CIS concept, a regionalized CIS Partnership Program is the foundation of the program. The current network configuration will be maintained to operate the Partnership Program, with the addition of Hawaii as a separate region. The Information Service, currently operated as a program component in 14 regional offices, will continue to provide multiple access points for the public.  However, it will be consolidated into four Coordinating Centers geographically situated to provide support and coordination of critical functions for a cluster of surrounding regional Partnership Program contracts.  ------

The four Coordinating Centers are configured to achieve approximate equivalency in population numbers in the eastern, central, and western portions of the country, while also accounting for differences in time zones and the partnership configuration. Experience in the current contracts shows that when calls are routed to the next available agent in a cluster of regions that the telephone service operates efficiently and transparently to users. The reduction in the number of CIS contact centers does not decrease capacity. The same number of users will be served.  The reduction in the number of contact centers allows significant cost savings while permitting the Coordinating Centers to function as anchors for the Partnership Program.-----

The plan is to award 15 contracts to operate the Partnership Program.  All potential contractors shall propose to operate the Partnership Program in one of the designated regions. All offerors will be encouraged to pursue Partnership Program subcontracts or other agreements to provide an equitable regional presence of the program as in the current contracts.  

--------REGIONS FOR CONTRACT AWARD--------

The Research Initiative will continue for all CIS contracts and focus on supporting NCIs research mission. The Cancer Information Service will participate in cancer control, behavioral and health communications research that supports the National Cancer Institutes (NCI) priorities and programs, particularly those addressing cancer health disparities.  Contractors will be expected to nurture research partnerships that build the CIS research portfolio contributing to NCIs research mission.

-------Proposal Options-----------

BASE OPTION: Partnership Program Contracts -----------
The NCI intends to award 15 contracts to operate the Partnership Program.  All potential contractors must submit a proposal to operate the Partnership Program in one of the designated regions.   In responding to the solicitation, offerors may also choose to propose on one or more of the following options.------------

OPTION 1: CIS Coordinating Center ---------------
Offerors proposing on Option 1 will operate one of four CIS Coordinating Centers providing coordinating services to a designated cluster of Partnership Regions and the operation of one of four contact centers.  In-depth understanding of the Partnership function is essential to providing the coordinating aspect of this option.-----
 
Each CIS contact center will provide the following services:  operate the toll free telephone service at 1-800-4 CANCER and the Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT and provide LiveHelp instant messaging services.-----

In addition, the Coordinating Center will provide the following services to the CIS network:  -------------- Coordination of:---Training to a cluster of CIS Partnership Offices; Regional information for a CIS national partnership website; Cancer and clinical trials content expertise.-----

----COORDINATING CENTER A will provide Contact Center Services and Partnership Program support to the following CIS Regions:  New England, New York, Atlantic, Mid-West-----

----- COORDINATING CENTER B will provide Contact Center Services and Partnership Program support to the following CIS regions: Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Mid-South, Coastal-----

OPTION 2: Spanish Telephone Service---------------
One successful offeror for Option 1 (Coordinating Center) will have the option to provide Spanish language services for the nation. All areas of the country will have access to this service during the regular hours of operation for each of the time zones.-------

--------Prerequisite:  propose to operate the CIS Partnership Program in one of the designated regions and propose on Option 1.  Please note that offerors are free to propose only on the Partnership Program and Option 1 if they choose.  ----------

OPTION 3: Email Center------------
One successful offeror for Option 1 (Coordinating Center) will respond by E-mail to individuals who address cancer information questions to NCIs website Cancer.gov.     

-----Prerequisite:  propose to operate the CIS Partnership Program in one of the designated regions and propose on Option 1.  Please note that offerors are free to propose only on the Partnership Program and Option 1 if they choose.----------
------------------CONCLUSION-------------------------
The proposed concept for the CIS does not reduce the capacity of the CIS to meet the cancer information needs of the public.  It realigns program resources, reduces costs, and promotes competition while retaining the strengths of its current CIS regional Partnership Program. The new concept maximizes NCIs potential for preserving trusted, long-standing regional relationships. At the same time, CIS is using technology to consolidate operations without severing the Partnership Program from the vital resources of the Information Service.  In the new concept, regionalized Partnership Program contracts maintain and enhance CISs ability to promote and deliver NCI products such as Cancer Control PLANET and the Clinical Trials Education Series through established partners.  In addition, the concept facilitates a practical communications link between regional Partnership Program contracts through the creation of Coordinating Centers that use technology to consolidate operations and provide a centralized location for streamlining critical program functions such as training and technical support for all program areas.

<DESC>The purpose of  Amendment 3 to the combined synopsis/solicitation NAMA-03-Q-0007 is to provide the following question and answer received on March 31, 2003. March 31, 2003 was the cut-off date for all questions. 

Question:

  Referring to:
 ...'conversion of each image to either: CLIN 0001AA 1024x768 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor; or CLIN 0001AB     800x600 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor',

It appears that the RFQ is requesting an output digital image quality (resolution and color depth) that is not supported in the original analog videodisc format, which has a maximum of 400 lines of horizontal resolution.  Given that the above analysis is correct (please advise if not), the pixel interpolation necessary to create the 'falsely' higher resolution digital image could instead be accomplished by the viewer station, allowing for the digital image to be captured at an image quality equal to the original analog source, saving critical storage space and network bandwidth for transfer and delivery.  Also, the NARA furnish Sony LDP -2000 videodisc player has an output resolution of 360 lines.

Answer:

NARA requires 800 x 600 pixel images (or the appropriate pixel array, with the long dimension not to exceed 800 pixels and maintaining the original aspect ratio) from the analog videodiscs.  File interpolation can be done during the digital capture step or as a post-capture interpolation using image processing software.  All equipment, software, processing algorithms, and image processing procedures should be optimized (as well as cited in the proposal) to provide the best quality images at the requested image dimensions.

This amendment also corrects the numbering of Amendment 1 to Amendment 2 in the posting dated March 28, 2003.

This amendment extends the proposal due to April 16, 2003, 4:00pm Eastern Daylight Time.

                                     END AMENDMENT NO. 3

<DESC>This synopsis is being re-posted to include the following sole source information.  All other information remains the same.  It is the intent of the Government to negotiate a sole source contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Time Tech GmbH, Curiestrasse 2, D-70563 Stuttgart Germany as this source is considered to be the only responsible source and no other source will satisfy agency requirements.  Interest sources proposing to supply the specified modem must submit a written qualification statement clearly establishing capability to meet the above requirements within 15 days from the date of this synopsis.  The qualification statements will be used to determine the need for competitive bids.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Time and Frequency Division has a requirement for a pseudo-random phase code spread spectrum modem to be used for Two-Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT).  The modem will be used for international time transfer among national timing laboratories according to the standards of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM).  Therefore the modem must be compatible with the MITREX codes.  In addition it must have phase code chip rates of 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 Mchips/s.  It must be upgradeable to a dual receive channel capability along with the ability to measure the carrier phase relative to a 5 MHz external reference.  Additional requirements are: (1) precision frequency counter with resolution of 1 mHz, (2) nominal 70 MHz input and output frequency, (3) Tx and Rx frequency agility of +/- 18 MHz, (4) LAN interface via TCP & UDP including remote monitoring and control, (5 ) NTP date and time-code interface, (6) 500 Mbyte hard disk , (7) 5 or 10 MHz reference frequency input, and (8) operate from 110 VAC, 60 Hz.  The modem must have a proven ability to support time transfer with a 200 picosecond stability (TDEV) at a 2.5 day interval using the 2.5 Mchip/s codes consistent with the requirements of the BIPM standards for TWSTFT.  Our equipment upgrade schedule requires a delivery time of no more than 12 weeks ARO.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000).  FAR Clauses in full text are at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/ .  This synopsis is issued for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email.  Information submitted in response to the notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. The qualifications statement should be submitted on or before July 7, 2003.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops\#REFERENCE . Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date will be July 8, 2003.

<DESC>This notice is amended to provide the following clarifications.  1.  The final plans are due to the respective base and HQ AMC Family Matters Office three weeks after the two day training session.
2.  There are not any known unique aspects regarding the objectives of the individual Community Capacity Action Plans by location.
3.  There is no change in the date and time established for receipt of quotes. 
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation, reference number 5TS5702C253.  The requirement is restricted to HUBZone small business concerns.  NAICS Code 624190, Other Individual and Family Services, applies.  This requirement is for a fixed price contract.  The GSA/FTS, Region 5 is announcing its intent to issue a firm fixed price contract for developing Community Capacity Action Plans in support of each Air Mobility Command base: Scott AFB , IL; Travis AFB, CA; McChord AFB, WA; Fairchild AFB, WA; McConnell AFB, KS; Pope AFB, NC; Charleston AFB, SC; McDill AFB, FL; Dover AFB, DE; McGuire AFB, NJ; Grand Forks AFB, ND; and Andrews AFB, MD.  The United States Air Force has long recognized the strong link between quality-of-life, particularly family and community support, and readiness and retention of Air Force personnel and provided broad-based programs and services in support of these outcomes.  Historically, key Air Force human service agencies are utilizing Community Needs Assessment (CNA) to plan, resource and guide programming on behalf of Air Force members, their families and communities.   The current CNA surveys are being administered and are scheduled to be complete August 2003.  Survey information will be provided when available.  Significant modifications in the structure of the CNA have been made to provide the community results data that facilitates planning, programming and resourcing of human service efforts consistent with these frameworks.  Key domain areas for the 2003 Community Assessment may include family adaptation, health and well being, personnel preparedness, spiritual wellness, sense of community, etc.   With the emergence of the Air Force Integrated Delivery System (IDS), which provides a mechanism for collaboration across all AF human service agencies to deliver services, increasingly focus has shifted from an assessment of needs to the assessment of results achieved within the community.  Currently, installation IDS teams across the AF are being trained to deliver and monitor services using the community capacity and results management models.  The IDS team is a diverse group and may include representatives from the family support center, child and youth services, chapel, family advocacy, mental health, health promotions, legal office, public affairs, and first sergeants.  IDS teams will have web access to all assessment reports.  Teams are required to analyze the data and develop a Community Capacity Action Plan in accordance with Air Force Instruction 90-501, Community Action Information Board and Integrated Delivery System.  Analysis should include the results from the 1999-2000 needs assessment as well as the 2003 data..  The IDS will complete all required demographic data in the plan and the contractor shall facilitate the collaborative development of the remainder of the plan.  The goal of the plan is to establish community and program results that will enhance readiness and retention, increase family adaptation, and strengthen the base sense of community.  Each AMC Base IDS team will identify no more than four community results.  Contractor shall identify result indicators and evaluation tools.  Contractor shall maintain a visual record of key discussion points, decisions, action plans, and a summary of training/meeting results.  The summary shall be electronically forwarded to the POC within three weeks of the training.  Any necessary travel by contractor personnel shall be the responsibility of the contractor.  Contractor proposal shall include and identify all travel costs.   Contractor shall visit each Air Mobility Command (AMC) base for a period of two days to assist IDS teams write their respective Community Capacity Action Plans based on the community assessment survey results.  The Family Support Center director will be the point of contact (POC) at each base.  The POC will arrange the meeting place, provide audio-visual equipment and office supplies; the POC will notify all base IDS members of the time, place, and any required pre-work.  Contractor training/meeting dates shall be coordinated with AMC/DPFF who will further coordinate with the AMC IDS team and Family Support Center Directors.  The 2-day contractor trainings/meetings shall be scheduled in a group setting for eight hours each day.    Deliverables for this task shall be: (1) a summary report of training/meetings, and (2) a final draft of the community capacity action plan.  Delivery and acceptance of all items shall be F.O.B. Destination. The period of performance for this contract task is 1 August 2003 through 29 February 2004.  All data and products resulting from this award shall become the property of the Government with unlimited rights.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Lynne Dickerhoff, Contract Specialist, (412) 365-5441, Contracting Officer - Lynne Dickerhoff, Contract Specialist, (412) 365-5441
<DESC>The Government is seeking professional design services from an architect-engineering firm to develop working drawings and specifications to improve Primary Care and Outpatient Pharmacy environments. The project involves primarily nonrecurring maintenance such as renovating existing outpatient space into Primary Care space, reconfiguring and expanding the existing Outpatient Pharmacy to reduce the congestion in the Pharmacy and outpatient waiting areas.  Minor improvements are limited to less than $500,000.  The project will improve the flow and accessibility of outpatients entering the main building and improve the physical security by expanding and joining the 2 existing main entrances.  The project will also address nonrecurring maintenance items such as removal and replacement of asbestos containing materials including floor tile, replacing lights, ceilings, updating finishes and modifications/replacement of existing HVAC and new HVAC throughout the area.  Approximately 14,000 SF +/-10% will be addressed for renovation plus sufficient space to join the 2 entrances with a new "storefront entry".  Designs will include compliance with all applicable building codes and VA design standards.  	The project will follow the guidelines established in the VA Pittsburgh Master Space Plan to enhance services at University Drive.  All designs will be compliant with space criteria referenced in VA Handbook 7610. Improve and expand functionality of the Outpatient Pharmacy using the existing Pharmacy office space and waiting space adjoining the Pharmacy.  Outpatient Pharmacy will be resized to accommodate the increase in workload identified in the 10-year plan.  Outpatient Pharmacy will also address the CARES plan to relocate Mental Health Outpatient Services to University Drive.  VA will relocate the administrative pharmacy staff to other areas within the building.  Reconfigure outpatient access to reduce congestion and improve access at the existing Outpatient Pharmacy windows.  Increase accessibility and improve patient privacy when receiving medications. 	Improve the physical security of the building by increasing the size of the Lobby by encompassing the existing two entrances, allowing a single entry point that can be monitored by a single security control and information point.  Establish a satellite security and information point to be used continuously to monitor access to the building.  Reconfigure the two existing Lobby entrances for improved patient access to existing Pharmacy and business services, circulation and reduce the walking distances to various outpatient areas. 	Relocate the Pharmacy waiting from specialty/primary care outpatient waiting into the extended Lobby area to reduce confusion and improve privacy.  	Renovate the existing waiting and support space on 1 Northeast to improve the functionality, access, and aesthetics.  Reconfigure the entry point to the existing clinics and relocate the existing administrative support center to space adjacent to the waiting areas for improved patient access. 	Replace existing HVAC units and provide additional units and controls where necessary to meet modern standards throughout the area.  VAV systems are preferred. 	Renovate and expand centralized toilet facilities to ensure adequate facilities for male and female patients. 	Update finishes throughout to modernize the appearance of all spaces. 	Ensure patient privacy criteria are met (i.e. computerized information and patient privacy). The A/E is responsible for providing certified industrial hygiene services to perform asbestos survey investigations (known items already identified do not need re-tested), bulk sampling, development of specifications and drawings, and construction period services.  All designs shall be accomplished in accordance with VA guidelines and specifications, which are available on the Internet at http://www.va.gov/facmgt/standard.  A/E shall pay particular attention to USAF, NSPA, BOCA, VA Handbook 7610 space criteria and VA Program Guide PG-18-14 "Room Finishes, Door and Hardware Schedule." The architect-engineer will make site visits as necessary to survey existing conditions as required to determine existing as-built conditions affecting this project. A/E shall field verify every aspect that relates to the project, coordinate visits with the Project Manager. A/E must be proficient in the use of Auto Cad 2000 and have access to Microsoft Word 5.0 or higher. Estimated cost of construction if $1,000,000.00 - $2,000,000.00. Area of consideration is restricted to within sixty (60) miles of the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, University Drive DIvision, Pittsburgh, PA  15240. Those interested firms, both small and large, within the area of consideration shall submit three (3) copies of current SF-254 and SF-255 to the attention of Lynne Dickerhoff (Contracting Officer) 04A1-H, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206. The NAICS code is 541330 with the small business size standard of $4.0 million. Due date for SF-254's and SF-255's is July 14, 2003 at close of business (COB) 4:30pm. This is not a request for proposal. Numbered Note #24.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for proven, flight certifiable sensors that can detect and quantify damage that may occur in-flight to the Space Shuttle Orbiter’s thermal protection system (TPS).  Such damage may occur during launch or on-orbit from debris impacts and may be of any form, including gouges, holes, or even missing tiles or panels.   The concept is to detect flaws by measuring the three-dimensional contour of critical vehicle surfaces. Several sensor mounting locations may be employed, including: (1) the external propellant tank (ET) (imaging the orbiter belly as it separates after main engine cutoff), (2) on an extendable Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) arm, (3) on the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS)arm or other external mounting location, (4) inside a space station window (viewing the orbiter as it pitches around during its approach to the ISS), or (5) on a free-flyer.  The viewing geometry and relative motion will be different at each mounting location and the TPS surfaces have a variety of contours and reflective properties.	 Preliminary sensor requirements are listed below. - Measurement:	 Detect and quantify 6 mm diameter x 6 mm deep and larger holes Spatial Resolution &lt; 6 mm, Depth Resolution &lt; 6 mm - Minimum Imaging Speed:	0.07 m^2/s at 5 m range; 5 m^2/s at 180 m range - Sensor-Target Range & Motion (as a function of sensor location/scenario):    ·	From ET (Image orbiter belly from mate (1 m) to &gt; 50 m at + 1.3 m/s) ·	     From SRMS (1 to &gt; 5 m range; 3-axis arm translation oscillation of +/- 6 mm at 0.67 Hz and +/- 1 deg rotation at 0.67 Hz)	·        From ISS window  (Orbiter 360 deg pitch-around at 1 deg/s at 180 m range) ·     From Free-Flyer (TBD) - Eye Safe (preferred) - Minimum sensor performance independent of natural lighting intensity and incidence angle - Small, low mass, low input power - Interfaces: ·      Electrical power ·      Command and Data ·	  Thermal ·	  Structural - Capable of specified performance in the respective mounting environment - Flight hardware and software available and flight certifiable within 6 – 14 months No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.	It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Requested information, for one or more of the mounting scenarios, includes: Functional and physical description, performance specifications, size, weight, power consumption, technology readiness level, design maturity, environmental specs and thermal control requirements. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are also invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references.  Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.	All responses shall be submitted to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30pm on 07/01/03.  Please reference 9-BH13-93-03-29P in any response.

<DESC>PSC Military Housing Company (PCSMHC), acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Combat Command, is pleased to announce the release of its Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Beale Air Force Base, California. Please note that "Step One" proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. local time 16 July 2003, at the offices of PSCMHC. PSCMHC intends to employ a two-step RFP process. In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Beale AFB project. PSCMHC, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Beale project. In the second step, up to five qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals. PSCMHC will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Government. The Beale Project involves the renovation of 1,344 units and the demolition of 209 existing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 1,344 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years. The Government expects to contribute leased real property without any improvements, and may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror. The Successful Offeror (SO) will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Beale family housing inventory. Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO. This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The RFP is available at http://www.pscmhc.com.

<CONTACT>Patricia Duggan, 256-842-8875
<DESC>NA This is a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit white papers in order to determine which U.S. firms have the capability to design and produce a Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL) weapon system prototype based upon Deuterium Fluoride (DF) chemical  laser technology.  Future procurement of this system will include system design, development, logistics, manufacturing, integration, demonstration, and test of the MTHEL weapon system as described below.  Responses to this RFI will be used by the Governme nt to identify potential contractors who can demonstrate they have the required capabilities to build the said system.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal, and is not to be construed as  a commitment by the Government to procure any items/services or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  System Description:  The MTHEL weapon system will consist of a laser fire unit to support air defense missions; a tailored existing or emergin g battle management architecture that is capable of effectively controlling the fire unit; and a Fire Control Sensor.  The MTHEL weapon system prototype, as described for this effort, is a subset of the MTHEL weapon system.  The MTHEL weapon system prototy pe will consist of: (1) A mobile laser, firing unit that shall use DF chemical laser technology to produce required output power; other high-energy laser technology is not acceptable. (2) An interface to an existing Fire Control Sensor through a tailored B attle Management, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) system.  The Government will provide this Fire Control Sensor. (3) A laser control system that interfaces with an existing or emerging BMC4I system and is capable of man aging up to six laser firing units.   The architecture must accept cueing from multiple fire control sensors.  The prototype laser control system shall be capable of identifying and prioritizing a complex set of air defense threats and maintaining positive  control of laser firing units.  The laser control system and BMC4I system must be exportable to Israel.    White Paper:  Contractors are requested to submit a white paper not to exceed 10 pages in length no later than 4:30 pm CDT on 18 July 2003.  The white paper must present an overview of the initial concept for meeting the MTHEL system requirements as descri bed in this notice.  The white papers should focus on the contractor's ability to fabricate the various subsystems required for an integrated MTHEL weapon system prototype.  Areas of principal concern are the system engineering, DF chemical laser, pointer tracking, beam control optics, and BMC4I interface development capabilities.  Additional system concerns are vibration control, power/cooling management, fuel management, transportability, and mobility.  The white paper should also discuss the contractor's  integration approach and methodology for developing an integrated prototype system by the FY07 timeframe.  The white paper must provide descriptions of DF laser systems that the contractor has built in the 100 kw class and show that they have the capabili ty to produce multiple systems.     Responses to this RFI should be submitted by mail to the following address:  U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN:  SMDC-CM-AP (Patricia Duggan), P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, Alabama 35807-3801.  Clarification questions may be sent via e-mail to  patricia.duggan@smdc.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a sources sought / market research conducted in accordance with FAR Part 10.  Andrews Air Force Base is requesting information and suggestions that will be useful in soliciting a mobile phone provider that provides traditional service with the added capability of two-way radio (pager) within the phone itself.  This Statement of Work (SOW) describes the level of service requested by the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB and infrastructure (cell coverage) requirements required from the Service provider.  To accomplish this, a Custom Network Solution (CNS) is required. This CNS SOW will provide coverage, capacity and digital wireless communications service for the 89th Communications Squadron, to include radio dispatch, group and private call; cellular telephone; text and numeric messaging and data features for 327 cell phones and 928 pagers.  The 89th Communications Squadron wishes to purchase certain subscriber equipment to include radios and accessories (the “Subscriber Equipment”), and to subscribe to the Service, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein.  Minutes of use per month per unit shall be pooled together among all units; the pooled minutes would include only private call minutes.  The 89th Communications Squadron Account Minute Pool is determined by multiplying the number of units with the same rate plan by the number of minutes included in that rate plan (example: unlimited minutes (UPC PLAN) equals a unlimited minute pool).  During the Agreement Term, each subscriber unit shall be billed at one rate plan, which would be selected by the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB upon activation of the unit. The subscriber units shall have the ability to utilize group call (one to many) features.  The dispatch option will allow the user to select one of multiple talk groups programmed in the device.  The 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB, to support dispatch operations, will define a talk group fleet map structure.  The subscriber units will have the ability to connect directly (one-to-one) with any other subscriber unit on the fleet.  The subscriber units can utilize this feature throughout the defined geographical region defined as Baltimore - Washington Home Calling Area. The subscriber units will have one way unlimited nationwide text and numeric messaging capabilities.  All subscriber units on an integrated service plan will have a specific number of minutes for digital cellular usage time per month.  Cellular minutes will be pooled together among all units within like plans.  Any charges in excess of the allotted number of minutes will be charged monthly to 89th Communications Squadron.  The contractor will ensure that coverage permeates at a target objective of 85 dBM signal at 95% within the following buildings:  1558, 1535, 1539, Hanger 1, Hanger 2, Hanger 3, Hanger 4, Hanger 5, Hanger 6, Hanger 7.  The contractor shall provide, at no cost to the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB, end user training at the 89th Communications Squadron within fourteen (14) days of issuance of a delivery order/contract for the initial units, or as new features are added by modification.  End user training will consist of proper operation of the end user equipment to include all features as described above.  The contractor will provide training materials and present at one (1) day of training each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement.  Should training for any quarter not be required, the 89th Communications Squadron will provide written notification to the contractor at least thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled date.  In the event it becomes necessary to install equipment on Andrews AFB, it shall be installed by the contractor and remain the property of the contractor subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement.  Equipment shall be available for use by the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB and be used by the contractor to provide service to the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB.  Prior to any installation, the contractor is instructed to notify 89th Communications Squadron specifically of the structures and/or equipment to be installed, as well as the proposed location of such structures and/or equipment.  Upon completion of installation the contractor shall provide a complete listing of all equipment installed to the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB.  This list shall be incorporated into and become part of the delivery order/contract via modification.  The contractor shall maintain and update this equipment as necessary on a bi-annual basis to include any new equipment installed at 89th Communications Squadron.  The listing shall include equipment installation date, value and associated installation costs.  To the extent that the contractor agrees to share its site structures and/or equipment with other companies, or allow others to “co-locate”, as that term is commonly used in the industry, on the site structures, the contractor must first seek and obtain from 89th Communications Squadron's installation commander an appropriate facilities license.  Training to designated 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB employees in a number mutually agreed to by the contractor and the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB (collectively the "trainers"), using the contractor's standard course, materials and methods provided to similarly situated customers, to prepare them to train the 89th Communications Squadron’s users in the use of the subscriber equipment and to provide first-echelon customer care to its users. The contractor will provide, at a minimum, two methods through which the 89th Communications Squadron will be able to manage their wireless assets.  Both methods will provide the 89th Communications Squadron, Andrews AFB with the following capabilities as follows: Order handsets and accessories, manage account and handset subscriber information, activate and make service changes to the handsets, review invoices and invoice details, receive status of order activities, and submit trouble tickets for support.  Please enclose any industry input on standard commercial practices, commercial terms, and cancellation clauses.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is issuing a Request for Information with the goal of        assessing different technologies to enable data and voice capabilities on small Coast Guard Cutters.  Various classes of small Coast Guard Cutters rely on Very High Frequency- Frequency Modulation (VHF-FM) marine band, cellular phone service, and High Frequency (HF) to enable Command and Control (C2) and operational communications for mission execution.  Many of the cutters (operating in geographic areas such as the Mississippi River and Great Lakes) have inadequate communications systems to support record message traffic or e-CG initiatives and find it difficult to use or identify a single communications medium or commercial service that meets all inter-modal communications requirements.  It is the Coast Guard’s desire to identify, analyze, test, evaluate, and integrate Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) equipment systems and services with the existing Coast Guard Standard Workstation infrastructure.
 
 
This will include the design, implement/outfit of multimode communications and architecture onboard the Coast Guard cutters.
The cutters the CG desires to bring this capability to include but may not be limited to:
Inland Buoy Tenders (WLI-65/60'), Small Harbor Tugs (WYTL-65'), River Tenders (WLR-75', and 65'), Coastal Patrol Boats (CPB-87'), Construction Tenders (WLIC-160', and 75’), Ice Breaking Tugs (WTGB-140'), Coastal Buoy Tenders (WLM-175', and 133'), and 75’), Seagoing Buoy Tenders (WLB-180', and 225’).  Estimated one hundred thirty three (133) cutters.  The size and weight of the equipment is critical.  This project is primarily systems integration and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) project to design, install, and support an enterprise solution for most small cutter classes.  The Coast Guard would like a communications system that has the capability to choose the most cost effective and efficient route off a ship to the Coast Guard Intranet (CGDN+) and Internet.  This system should have voice and data capabilities in all required regions.  It would be necessary to have a protected (Type 3 minimum) voice capability, and is possible that secure data (up to Class 1) may be required in the future.  Coast Guard Buoy/River tenders have the need to update Aids to Navigation databases hosted on the Internet, in real time.  All ships have requirements to have reliable communications back to their group throughout their respective Area Of Responsibility, (AOR) and it is becoming more important for some vessels to have a data capability within that same region.  A smart application of multiple communications media and services which leverage new technology through some combination of wireless technology, (e.g.) cellular, (VHF-FM), (HF), 802.11 and/or commercial satellite.  It is envisioned that a combination of these technologies could deliver complete and highly reliable/desirable voice and data communications to the affected cutters.  Consideration will be given to automated solutions that meet the Department’s criteria for sound architecture, including non-proprietary (open) software components, hosting on standard hardware, flexible user interface, and standard interface design.  Methodologies proposed should align well to known best practices in the public and private sectors, and be clear, succinct, and intuitive.  The majority of these platforms are small and do not have extensive networks on board, options for portable equipment may be desirable for certain sized vessels.  Space and weight of any additional equipment is also of great concern, smaller and lighter is best, especially if mounted up high.  Vessels will require connectivity while transiting rivers, lakes and oceans, and will experience adverse weather and seas; considerations should be made to take into effect these factors.  It is vital that whatever the solution for small cutters, it be interoperable with the system being done by both the Rescue 21 and Deepwater projects.  The Rescue 21 project is providing both voice and date VHF and UHF frequencies.  Deepwater is providing for increased C4ISR on the largest of the Coast Guard Cutters.  For more info on either of these two projects please go to:
http://www.uscg.mil/rescue21/home/index.htm; 
http://www.uscg.mil/deepwater/
These vessels have areas of responsibility primarily in and around North       America,Caribbean, Hawaii, and Guam.  Responses to this RFI should not exceed 15 pages, including explanatory graphics.  Information specifically applicable to the Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security will be most useful in evaluating the content of the response.  The response should indicate technical and contracting points of contact and the size of the business.    
At a minimum, responses should address:
The key points of the hardware and technologies being proposed: including security, coverage, cost (recurring and non-recurring), system throughput, and support.  Supporting /implementing components and tools.
Possibilities of future expansion of the bandwidth and system capabilities.
The expected value added of applying the described approach.
Integration to existing CG network architecture.
This request for information in no way implies either implicity or explicity that respondents will be compensated in any way by the Government for information or materials provided.  All information provided becomes U.S. Coast Guard property and will not be returned.  All information must be mailed to the Commandant   (G-ACS-1B/WM), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW, Room 5222, Washington, DC  20593-0001, ATTN: Wilbert Mann.  Information must be received prior to July 29, 2003, to be considered.

I. INTRODUCTION.  The Radio Frequency (RF) Sensors Division of the Avionics Department of NAWCAD Patuxent River, Maryland is soliciting proposals for research in technologies that are applicable to RF Sensor Systems for Navy aircraft.

II. BACKGROUND.  The RF Sensors Division continues developing advanced systems and technologies for Naval Aviation.  Many areas of application include Synthetic Aperture Radar, Multi-function Radar, advanced antennas, image & data processing, and communications.  The RF Sensors Division continues to develop advanced capabilities to reduce the cost of transitioning technology into the Fleet.

III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST.  This BAA is to solicit technical/cost proposals for research support in technologies that are applicable to Radio Frequency (RF) Sensor systems for Navy Aircraft. Major areas of interest include  (1) Signal Processing, (2) Antennas and Propagation, (3) Information Processing, (4) Devices and Materials, (5) Radar and RF Communications Systems Engineering Methodologies, and (6) Aircraft Installation Technologies. New, innovative and creative approaches to technical problems that significantly advance radar and RF Communication system performance and improve aircraft installations are sought. Among the primary interest areas are AEW radar operating at UHF through L band and S-band, tactical radar operating at C, X, and Ku bands, synthetic aperture radar operating in X-, C-, L-, and UHF-bands, and C3I systems operating at any radio frequency throughout the spectrum. Examples of technologies include, but are not limited to, antennas, antenna array concepts, electronically scanned arrays, conformal arrays, radomes, propagation, scattering, and diffraction, rough surface scattering, computational electromagnetics (with emphasis on antenna design and antenna-platform interaction), phased array antenna concepts, electronically scanned arrays, devices and materials, remote sensor telemetry and miniaturized RF telecommunication transceivers, optical components/fiber  optics, photonics and monolithic microwave integrated circuits,  high power broadband T/R modules and associated subassembly/device  technologies, direct digital synthesis exciter concepts, space-time  adaptive processing (STAP) techniques for circular arrays,  massively parallel processing architectures for multi-channel  STAP, software engineering, advanced signal processing of synthetic  aperture radar data, advanced image processing, data and image exploitation, moving target imaging techniques, automatic  target recognition and classification, advanced signal  processing concepts for multi-mode sensor operation, and equipment installation techniques solutions. 

IV. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE. NAWCAD is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions).  Other Transactions will be entered into under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research, or by contacting Ben Hansford at (301) 342-5738 or by e-mail at hansfordbj@navair.navy.mil.  Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.

NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project.  Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

B.	PHASE II ? Full Proposal

General Information:  Only Offerors whose Phase I - White Paper is considered capable of meeting Program requirements will be asked to submit Phase II - Full Proposals. REQUEST FOR SUBMISSION OF A FULL PROPOSAL DOES NOT GUARANTEE AWARD SELECTION. Proposals shall be submitted in original, with the signature of an authorizing official, with three (3) copies to the address noted above. Proposal submission is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and small, HUBZone small disadvantaged, and women owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  Submit Full Proposals in two (2) volumes; 

VOLUME I ? TECHNICAL PROPOSAL, not to exceed twenty-five (25) pages, should include the following three sections: Section 1 - Executive Summary: Provide a brief technical and business description of the contents of the proposal. The technical area should address the proposal's technical goals, approach, and expected results. The business area should address business and/or commercial applications of the proposal technology. Section 2 - Technical Issues: Detail the technical approach, objectives, staffing and resources relating to the development of the proposed technology for military and commercial (if applicable) use; discuss specifically in realistic terms the technical objectives of this proposed effort; provide a Statement of Work (SOW) that discusses the specific tasks to be accomplished, tied to the specific approach and goals of the project; provide resumes for Principle Investigator(s) and other key research personnel; describe the current and planned facilities and equipment to accomplish the research objectives; and, give a description of past performance on similar efforts. Section 3 - Business Issues: Discuss the business issues relating to the commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market; detail benefits to the Department of Defense (DoD).

VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, and should address funding periods of performance.  Formal work breakdown structures and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired, however, NAVAIR reserves the right the request this information for proposals using FAR/DFARS type contracts. Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order: 

Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of 
the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the Statement of Work and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see above); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing. 
Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors? cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? 
Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement.  The offeror shall present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made. 
Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements. 


VI. EVALUATION CRITERIA. The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement.  The merit of the proposal shall be determined based on the following criteria listed in order of importance: 

(1) The Offeror's ability to demonstrate feasibility and potential contributions of the effort to DOD priorities in RF Sensor related technologies; 

(2) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; 

(3) The Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives; 

(4) Proposed cost, adjusted for cost realism; 

(5) The Offeror's past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort; and 

(6) Socio-economic merits (contracts only).  For awards to be made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, HUB zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns, service disable veteran-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCU/MI).  

III. AWARDS.  NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated above (See para. II). All awards will be based on merit competition. The Government reserves the right to select all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations.  There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the contracting officer, and the total exceeds $500,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for 5 RF/CW Power Meters and 10 Power Sensors for CFGS Power Detection.  These sensors and meters will be used to calibrate the input and reflected power for our antenna calibrations.  There will be 5 sets of forward/reverse measurements taken (i.e. one pair per meter).  The rear panel monitor ports will be used to interface with our amplifiers to allow direct shutdown of the amplifiers to prevent over-drive.   These sensors will generate information used to calibrate delivered power to a calibration quality device.  Low uncertainty, high degree of linearity and high RF performance over a wide bandwidth and power ranges are required.  It is essential that the power meters and sensors meet the following technical specifications:
1)	A quantity of 5 - dual-channel RF/CW POWER METERS.
a)	IEEE-488 computer interface connection.
b)	-70 to +20 dBm power sensing linearity must be maintained throughout the entire -70 to +20 dBm range.
c)	Full AGILENT 438/437 code compatibility/emulation - especially these five characteristics:
(i)	Code compatibility must be able to be programmed in power-up mode.
(ii)	Offset-on/Offset-off.
(iii)	Unit must maintain code compatibility with changes in sensors.
(iv)	Dwell time.
(v)	Measurement averaging.
d)	Emulation must be maintained through power cycle (ON-OFF-ON) and sensor change.
e)	Power meter must have a port to calibrate sensors - (and appropriate adaptors for sensor connectors) - calibration must be traceable to NIST.
f)	All sensors must be usable on all power meter channels.
g)	GPIB & remote setting of frequency.  If a frequency selection is sent to the power meter - adjustments for correcting the reading of the sensor must be made at the power meter.
h)	Sensors must have frequency calibration factors in the sensor heads and calibration settings on the meters must be controllable over GPIB with a frequency selection command to the meter/sensors.  The sensors must be able to identify itself by serial number when requested.
i)	Two monitoring channels per meter - one for each RF detection channel.  0 to 5 volts that is linear with RF detected by the sensor.  Scale factor is user programmable - scale factor programming remains in memory through instrument preset and power-down-power-up cycle.  BNC connector.  Rear panel output.
j)	Zeroing feature - allows user to set the RF zero power setting as a reference point-zeroing of each channel must be independent.
k)	Labview drivers available for meters that perform multi-data point/channel measurement and averaging.
l)	Include a programmable calibration for external adaptors - meter and sensor can be calibrated to include a frequency selective calibration for adaptor/attenuator losses.
2)	POWER SENSORS - 10 channels of power sensing - no external adaptors to get to the connector interface desired (additional adaptors increase VSWR, add loss and increase uncertainty in the RF measurement).  
a)	2 channels: 10 MHz - 6 GHz - Precision N male connectors-linearity 1.8% maximum - VSWR (0.1-2 GHz: 1.12),(0.01-6GHz : 1.22)
b)	4 channels: 10 MHz - 18 GHz - Precision N male Connectors-linearity 1.8% maximum - VSWR (0.1-2 GHz: 1.12),(0.01-18GHz : 1.25)
c)	2 channels: 10 MHz - 26.5 GHz - 2.92 mm K male Connectors-linearity (0.01-18GHz - 1.8%),(18-26.5GHz-2.5%) - VSWR (0.1-2 GHz: 1.12),(2-26.5GHz : 1.35)
d)	2 channels:  10 MHz - 40 GHz  - 2.92 mm K male Connectors-linearity (0.01-18GHz - 1.8%),(18-40GHz-2.5%) - VSWR (0.1-2 GHz: 1.12),(2-26.5GHz : 1.35),(26.5 GHz - 40 GHz: 1.5)
e)	3 meter cables to interconnect the sensor and meters for all cables. 
f)	All sensors must be DC blocked through the RF port - DC voltage on the RF line must not affect detected RF power reading. - CRITICAL SPECIFCATION - the systems attached to the sensors may have residual DC charge build up and this must not affect measured RF power. 
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  The proposed procurement is non-restrictive, but small businesses will receive preference.  Written quotes will be received up to the close of business on July 3, 2003.  Quotations should list product specifications addressing the above list of requirements and will be tested on-site before award.  Upon receipt of the award, delivery must be within eight weeks.  Selection will be based upon technical merit and price.  Any questions should be sent in writing to Kelly.Rima@noaa.gov.  FAR Clauses in full text are available at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/.

<SUBJECT>A -- UTILIZATION OF AN ANTIMUSCARINIC ANTICHOLINERGIC DRUG IN A NIH SPONSORED MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL OF COMBINED BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND DRUG THERAPY IN WOMEN WITH URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE
<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases seeks of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service of the Department of Health and Human Services seeks collaborations with Industry to provide to the NIDDK an antimuscarinic/anticholinergic drug for use in a National Institutes of Health sponsored multi-center clinical trial comparing drug therapy combined with behavioral therapy versus drug therapy alone on the frequency of episodes of urge urinary incontinence in women.

INTRODUCTION:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is planning to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate if the addition of behavioral treatment to drug therapy for the treatment of women with urge urinary incontinence will substantially increase the number of patients who are able to discontinue drug therapy and sustain a significant reduction of incontinence.    The two-arm trial will enroll approximately 270 women over a 12-month period and randomize them to either drug therapy alone or a combination of behavior therapy and drug therapy. The drug will be administered in an unmasked fashion.  Enrollment will occur at nine participating clinical centers (William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan; Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois; University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama; University of California at San Diego; University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland; University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, University of Texas at Dallas; University of Texas at San Antonio, and the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah).  Central data collection and analysis will occur at the NIDDK funded Data Coordinating Center at the New England Research Institutes, Watertown, Massachusetts.

STUDY GOALS:  The primary aim of this randomized clinical trial is to test if the addition of behavioral treatment to drug therapy for the treatment of urge incontinence in women will increase the number of patients who can discontinue drug therapy and sustain a significant reduction of urinary incontinence (i.e., 70% fewer incontinence episodes compared to baseline) compared to drug therapy alone.  

Other study aims include:

1.)	to test whether the effectiveness of drug therapy can be enhanced by combining it with components of behavioral intervention;
2.)	to determine the cost-effectiveness of combining behavioral and drug therapy in clinical practice; and
3.)	to examine the long-term durability of drug and behavioral treatments.  

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  In 2000, the NIDDK established the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN).  The purpose of the UITN is to conduct high quality randomized controlled clinical trials of urinary incontinence.  Currently, the UITN is conducting a trial comparing two surgical procedures for women with stress urinary incontinence.  A second protocol has now been developed by the UITN investigators entitled, “The Effects of Adding Behavioral Treatment to Drug Therapy:  Treatment Outcomes and Response to Drug Withdrawal”.  This protocol has been recently approved by an independent NIDDK appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board .  It is anticipated that patient recruitment will begin in the spring 2004.  However, the Collaborator will have the opportunity to comment on the study protocol.  The Collaborator will also participate as an ex-officio member of the Steering Committee.  The duration of the trial will be approximately 20 months; a 12-month recruitment period and a minimum of 8 months follow-up. The Collaborator providing the antimuscarinic/anticholinergic drug will be expected to provide free drug for the 8-week drug treatment period for approximately 270 study participants. The Collaborator may have access to information about the outcome of the study at the same time as the participating investigators.  The Collaborator may participate as a member of the publication committee.  A Clinical Trials Agreement between the NIDDK and the Collaborator will need to be executed prior to drug shipment.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” to help in their deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  The Capability Statement may not exceed 10 pages and should address the following criteria: time line for ability to provide drug after selection of Collaborator is determined, approved daily dose of drug, previous studies of efficacy of drug in treating women with overactive bladder/urge incontinence, and known side-effects of drug.
 
SUBMISSION DATES:  A written statement of interest must be submitted by 1 August 2003 and all Collaborator Capability Statements must be submitted by 15 August 2003.

<SUBJECT>R -- Analysis of the Summer Food Service Program and Food Needs of Nonparticipating Children
<DESC>At this time the Food and Nutrition Service of the USDA is seeking comments on the following statement of work (SOW).  This may be the only notice prior to the issuance of a solicitation pending the comments received on the SOW.

It is requested that if you have any comments (NO QUESTIONS) that they be submitted by 4:00pm (EST) Friday, June 27, 2003.

Analysis of the Summer Food Service Program and
 Food Needs of Nonparticipating Children
Statement of Work

I.  Overview and Background Information

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has conducted evaluation research on the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) which makes meals available to qualifying children that participate in the program.  Arising from this past research is a recognized need to better understand how and the extent to which the food needs for qualifying children are being met who do not participate in SFSP when the regular school term is out for the summer months.   

During the regular school year, the federally funded National School Lunch Program makes available nutritious meals to children attending elementary, middle and high schools.  Children, who could not otherwise afford to pay full price, are able to receive their lunch for free or at a reduced price, depending on the economic status of their household.  Breakfasts are also made available in most school districts during the school year to meet the food needs of economically disadvantaged children.

When regular school lets out for the summer, children from low-income families can potentially participate in the SFSP.  Meals available through the SFSP are offered through various educational and recreational activities, including camps, sports and art/craft activities.  Also, children can obtain meals in the summer through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) offered in summer school.  The primary goal of SFSP is to provide nutritious meals to children in low-income areas in the summer.  The summer food program for children operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.   However, only one-in-five of the 15.3 million children who receive free or reduced-priced school lunches during the regular school year are served by federal nutrition programs during the summer.

FNS seeks a qualified contractor to develop the research and sample designs and to conduct a limited number of in-depth personal interviews with the parents and/or guardians of children who participate in free and reduced lunches during the school year but who do not participate in SFSP.  Interviews shall also be conducted for comparison purposes with households that have qualifying children who do participate in the SFSP.  Interviews shall be held in a limited set of sites, to be specified by the contractor, around the United States.

This statement of work consists of five parts.  Part I provides overview and background information.  Part II identifies the study’s objectives and research questions.  Part III lays out the research design and methodological issues.  Part IV provides  a set of tasks and deliverables for illustrative purposes that potentially could be used to meet the study’s objectives.  Part V is special qualification requirements that the in-depth interviewer(s) must meet before they can be employed on this research project.


II.  Study Objective and Research Questions

The objective of the research is to assess how and the extent to which the summer food needs of children are being met when they do not participate in a summer food service program, although they qualify and receive free or reduced-priced lunches during the regular school year.

The following are some of the key questions that the research will focus on:

1.	Are families of qualifying children aware of the SFSP?  If yes and their children do not participate in SFSP, what are the reasons as to the children’s non-participation? 
2.	Are qualifying children who do not participate in SFSP food insecure or hungry?  Is this different from the situation when the regular school year is in session?
3.	What are the perceptions and attitudes of parents about the eating patterns of their children, both those that participate and those that don’t participate in SFSP, during the summer when they are not in school?
4.	What are parents/guardians of qualifying children who don’t participate in SFSP doing to feed their children during the summer, in general and at lunch?  Do they take any special steps when feeding their children during the summer to:  avoid hunger, avoid skipping of meals or making sure that specific types of food are consumer?
5.	What childcare (including meal preparation and service) arrangements are these households utilizing if their children do not participate in SFSP?  Are children left unsupervised because parents/guardians are working to acquire additional money needed for food during the summer months?
6.	If qualifying children do participate in SFSP, but the SFSP is only available for a portion of the summer months, what arrangements are made during the period of time that SFSP is not available?


III.  Study Design

A.  Research and Sample Designs:
1.	The contractor shall develop a qualitative research design of in-depth, personal interviews to gather information and formulate an understanding to the research questions.  The in-depth, personal interviews shall be conducted with the individual in the household who is the primary care provider in the household and who has the responsibility for meeting the food needs of the children during the summer.  Households who have children that receive free or reduced price lunches during the regular school year but who do not participate in a summer food service program will be sampled and interviewed.  For comparison purposes, households will also be interviewed with children who receive free or reduced price lunches during the regular school year and who do participate in a summer food program.
2.	The contractor shall select a limited number of SFSP sites, up to four (4), around the United States to conduct the interviews in order to achieve efficiency in the cost and time required for conducting the in-depth, personal interviews.  Sites included in the sample shall be selected so as to provide a diversity of geographical location, urbanization, type of SFSP site operator, type of meals provided and activities offered, and racial/ethnic composition of the population served.  The contractor shall develop the sample design that specifies the number of interviews and the method of sampling households at each site.  The contractor shall conduct interviews at each site with households with qualifying children who don’t participate in a summer food service program and households that have qualifying children who do participate in a summer food program.  

B.	Methodological Issues – The following are, at a minimum, methodological issues that the contractor shall address when developing and proposing a study design: 

1.	Identification of sites with SFSP available, especially those with low participation of low-income households.
2.	Identification of low-income households with school-age children not participating in SFSP.
3.	Securing the cooperation of low-income households to complete the in-depth interviews so as to achieve a cost effective response rate.
4.	Development of the survey instruments that are able to elicit appropriate responses from low-income interviewees on the food needs of their children during the summer. 
5.	Development of guidelines or methods for allaying concerns among low-income households about the nature of the interview and the possible perception of interference in how they meet the food needs of their children.
6.	Establishment of procedures for monitoring the interviewing process to assure that only qualifying households are interviewed and in the numbers required to meet quota.
7.	Establishment of methods for monitoring and maintaining detailed records so that progress on the interviewing can be communicated to FNS on a weekly basis.

 
IV.  Tasks and Deliverables

The following tasks are illustrative of the effort required to achieve the study’s goals and objectives.  Offerors are encouraged to develop research approaches, including appropriate tasks, that result in an efficient, comprehensive plan for executing the study.

A.  Task I – Project Orientation Meeting

Within the first week after contract award, the contractor’s project director and senior supervisory staff for the interviewers shall meet with FNS staff from the Office of Analysis, Nutrition and Evaluation in Alexandria, VA for an orientation meeting to discuss the project’s objectives, research questions, design, study tasks, schedule and deliverables.  The meeting shall cover, but not be limited to, the:

·	purpose and research questions to be answered by the research,
·	background information that will aid the contractor’s understanding of the research objectives,
·	tasks to be accomplished,
·	schedule and deliverables, and
·	required monthly reports and reports on the status of the interviewing.

The contractor shall submit to FNS a memorandum summarizing the orientation meeting within one week after the meeting.  This summary memorandum shall include all issues discussed at the meeting, conclusions reached, and any issues remaining to be resolved.

B.  Task II – Develop Data Collection Instruments, Screeners and OMB Clearance Package

The contractor shall develop a data collection instrument for the in-depth, personal interviews with households that have qualifying children for the summer food program who do not participate and a separate data collection instrument for households who have children who do participate.  The survey instruments shall be developed in consultation with FNS and designed to answer the research questions.  The contractor shall also develop screeners to be used in identifying qualifying households and recruiting participants for the in-depth interviews.  The contractor shall also develop the associated OMB clearance package required for the survey of households using the two questionnaires.

The contractor shall conduct a pretest of the survey instruments, screeners and the proposed field procedures.  No single instrument shall be tested on more than nine respondents.  The results of the pretests will be used to refine the instruments and screeners prior to submission to OMB for approval.  Before initiating the pretest, the contractor shall submit the instrument package, screeners and proposed field procedures to FNS for review.  This package will be reviewed by staff from FNS and Child Nutrition and members of the Food and Nutrition Subcommittee of the Education Information Advisory Committee (EIAC).  Comments from members of these groups shall be incorporated by the contractor into the pretest package.

The contractor shall prepare the draft, revised and final versions of the package requesting OMB approval for all data collection activities.  The package shall contain copies of all data collection instruments, screeners and a supporting statement as set forth in the revised Standard Form No. 83a, “Instructions for Requesting OMB Approval under the Federal Reports Act, as Amended.”

The draft OMB package shall provide an explicit, concise description of the direct links between the study’s objectives, research questions, variables, instrument items, data analysis plans and desired products.  It shall include a summary of public comments received in response to the 60-day Federal Register Notice concerning the information collection and any actions taken in response to these comments on the draft.  Five (5) copies of the draft OMB package shall be submitted to FNS for review.  The revised OMB package shall be submitted to FNS within two weeks of receipt of FNS comments.  In addition to the ten (10) hard copies of the revised OMB package, the contractor shall provide a copy of the final OMB package to FNS on a CD in two formats:  a microcomputer word processing format agreeable to FNS, such as Microsoft Word and a portable document format file (PDF).  The contractor shall allow 90 calendar days for OMB approval.  Study instruments shall be modified to reflect comments from OMB, if necessary.

C.  Task III– Prepare Data Collection Training Package and Data Collection Instructions

The contractor shall develop data collection and interviewer training instructions to accompany the data collection instruments for use by the interviewers and data processors.  Two (2) copies of the draft data collection and interviewer training instructions shall be submitted to FNS for review.  The final data collection and interviewer training instructions shall be revised to accommodate FNS comments and five (5) copies submitted to FNS for final approval.

D.  Task IV – Select and Train Data Collectors

The contractor shall select and train interviewers to conduct the in-depth, personal interviews.  Interviewers selected for this study shall demonstrate ability and prior experience in conducting interviews with low-income individuals.  All individuals selected to conduct the in-depth interviews shall meet the special requirements identified in Section V of the statement of work.   The contractor shall recruit a sufficient number of fluent English speaking interviewers and Spanish speaking interviewers for all sites.  Training of interviewers by the contractor shall include, at a minimum, an overview of the study, data collection instruments, procedures for data collection, and simulated data collection exercises.   The same set of interviewers shall be required to conduct the interviews at all of the sites sampled by the contractor.  Any substitution of an interviewer(s) must be approved by FNS. 

E.  Task V – Identifying the Sample Sites and Conducting the In-Depth Interviews

The contractor shall specify the number and location of the SFSP sites to be sampled.  The SFSP sites selected for the sample shall reflect a diversity of geographical location, urbanization, type of site operator, type of meals provided and activities offered, and racial/ethnic composition of the population served.  The contractor shall be ultimately responsible for identifying households within the site areas who have children who qualify for and participate in the free or reduced school lunch program during the regular school year and who:

·	Have qualifying children who do not participate in the SFSP

·	Have qualifying children who do participate in the SFSP.

The contractor shall identify, screen and recruit households and the individuals within the households who are responsible for meeting the food needs of the children during the summer.  The contractor shall submit a plan for recruiting participants for the in-depth, personal interviews.  The recruitment plan shall take into account the degree of difficulty of recruiting qualified households and household members for discussions on how and how well the food needs of their children are being met during the summer.

The contractor shall conduct interviews at each of the sampled sites with households that have a child who participates in the free or reduced-price lunch program during the regular school year but who does not participate in a SFSP.  The contractor shall also conduct interviews at each of the sampled sites with households who have a child participating in the free or reduced-price lunch program during the regular school year and who participates in a SFSP.

The contractor shall be responsible for securing an appropriate facility within each site area where the interviews can be conducted. 

The contractor shall audio-tape each in-depth interview for which the individual being interviewed gives his/her permission.

The contractor shall keep FNS advised of the progress of data collection on a weekly basis through email updates.   
F.  Task VI – Prepare Analytic Plan, Create Study Data Base and Analyze Data

The contractor shall develop and submit an analytic plan to FNS for approval.  The analytic plan shall provide tabulations and analysis of households with qualifying children who participate in the SFSP and households with qualifying children who do not participate in the SFSP.   A breakout by site location and other key identifiers is required.  The contractor shall create analytic files and conduct the appropriate analyses after the analytic plan has been approved by FNS.  If needed during the period of the contract, the contractor shall prepare and submit a Memorandum of Intent which describes the revised analysis plan that updates the original study proposal.  The Memorandum of Intent shall be submitted to FNS for approval.  A revised analytic plan is not viewed as a major revision of the proposed plan and shall not change the Scope of Work nor have a substantial impact on overall anticipated costs.  No revisions or changes to the contract shall occur without the approval of the contracting officer.  This statement of work shall serve as the framework upon which subsequent contract activity shall be based.  

G.  Task VII – Presentation of Preliminary Findings

The contractor shall present FNS with two (2) copies of the preliminary tabulations, findings, analyses, and tables prior to writing the final report.  FNS will review and provide any necessary comments prior to the contractor preparing the final report. 

H.  Task VIII – Prepare Report

The contractor shall prepare a draft, revised and final report that details the results of the analyses.  A detailed outline and subsequent drafts of the report shall be submitted to FNS for review and comment.  At a minimum, this report shall contain the following:

<SUBJECT>--DEFENSE PERSONAL PROPERTY SYSTEM (DPS)
<DESC>NA HQ, Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) intends to post a Draft Statement of Work (SOW) for the Defense Personal Property System (DPS). DPS will employ cutting edge technology and best practices to build a single, paperless DoD personal property pro gram that integrates and automates all processes that support DoDs families moves worldwide.  DoD uses over 900 transportation providers (TP) for movement and storage services.  Management of such a vast number of providers has resulted in complex processe s to qualify TPs, solicit rates, distribute traffic, evaluate performance, pay bill and settle claims.  MTMC currently operates one legacy information technology (IT) system to support management of these personal property shipments.  The Transportation Op erational Personal Property Standard system (TOPS) was developed to manage all DoD personal property movements.  Over 200 Personal Property Shipping Offices currently utilize TOPS.  MTMC is also currently developing the Centralized Web Application (CWA) as  an interim web-based solution to integrate with TOPS to handle the automated approval of shipments and cost shipments using a Government rating engine.  The CWA also interfaces with U.S. Bank PowerTrack, a web-based commercial business-to-business payment  system.  MTMC is looking to replace TOPS and the CWA functionality with an end to end, web-based solution.  MTMC is seeking an independent organization to provide a commercial solution to meet MTMCs DPS requirements and then operate and maintain the servi ce for DoD.  MTMC desires to maximize use of best-of-breed commercial software and limit customization to unique, unavoidable DoD requirements.  MTMC generally desires to change business practices rather than customize the commercial solution.  MTMC expect s the final integrated services to be delivered 185 business days after performance start date; this includes meeting all security and accreditation requirements.  The contractor will have the capability to (1) perform integration, testing, and implementat ion parallel with continuing legacy system operations. (2) Host the service off-site at a third-party location, and (3) build upon DPS service capabilities by incorporating the functionality of selected systems into the DPS service in the future.  The draf t Statement of Work is expected to be posted at www.mtmc.army.mil on/or about 18 June 2003.  Issuance of the solicitation can be expected on/or about 4 Aug 2003.  All responsible sources are encouraged to provide comments to the draft Statement of Work.  T his invitation to comment on the draft Statement of Work will be used for planning purposes only.
