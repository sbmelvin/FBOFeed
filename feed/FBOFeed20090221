The application of a scale of words will be used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for a criteria evaluation factor.  For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives.  Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level.  If at any level of indentation an Offers submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for the criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory),the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation.  Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level.  The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<BR><BR>(i) Outstanding  Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards.  The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.  Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  The offerors qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government.  The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract.  Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements.  There is a very high probability of success.<BR><BR>(ii) Above Average - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to exceed performance or capability standards.  Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.  The offerors qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements.  The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government.  The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements.  Disadvantages are minimal.  There is a high probability of success.<BR><BR>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral)  Information submitted demonstrate offerors potential to meet performance or capability standards.  The information represents an acceptable solution.  Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas.  A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved.  The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements.  No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral.  There is a good probability of success.<BR>(iv) Marginal  The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement.  The offerors interpretation of the Governments requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient.  The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement requirements.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall project.  The offerors qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government.  There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable.  There are significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>(v) Unsatisfactory  The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards.  Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal.  There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved.  The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Governments requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. There are very significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>5.

When site visits are conducted at Government installations, the Contractor shall comply with the security requirements of the installation.<BR><BR>4.  EVALUATION RATINGS: <BR><BR>4.1	Ratings.  The application of a scale of words will be used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for criteria evaluation.  For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives.  Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level.  If at any level of indentation an Offers submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for a criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory), the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation.  Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level.  The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<BR><BR>(i) Outstanding: Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards.  The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.  Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  The offerors qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government.  The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract.  Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements.  There is a very high probability of success.<BR><BR>(ii) Above Average: Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to exceed performance or capability standards.  Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.  The offerors qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements.  The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government.  The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements.  Disadvantages are minimal.  There is a high probability of success.<BR><BR>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral): Information submitted demonstrate offerors potential to meet performance or capability standards.  The information represents an acceptable solution.  Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas.  A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved.  The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements.  No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral.  There is a good probability of success.<BR><BR>(iv) Marginal:  The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement.  The offerors interpretation of the Governments requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient.  The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement criteria requirements.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall submittal rating.  The offerors qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government.  There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable.  There are significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>(v) Unsatisfactory:  The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards.  Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal.  There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved.  The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Governments requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. There are very significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>5.
