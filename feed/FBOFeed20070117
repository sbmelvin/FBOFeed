<DESC>The 17th Annual Military Team Bass Fishing Tournament sponsored by the Robins AFB 78th Services Division, Smith Community Center, will be held from May 6 through the 11, 2007. This event will be held at Lake Barkley Marina in Cadiz, Kentucky. Last year we had over 145 teams competing in the fishing tournament giving us over 500 spectators for the week. The competing teams represented all five branches of the Armed Services and traveled from 31 different states. 
This year we anticipate maximum participation of two hundred teams. We would like to offer you the opportunity to play a part in this tournament by becoming a commercial sponsor. There are many different package levels to choose from for sponsorship. The package you choose determines the type of recognition you will receive. Some examples of the recognition your company may obtain are a banner hung during the entire tournament, company name and\or logo on the t-shirts, web-page and press release recognition just to name a few. We are also allowing sponsors to set up display tables during the week, which will include registration, the hospitality suite and weigh-in. We are looking for monetary or in-kind sponsorship from companies for trophies, t-shirts, door prizes, large and small, and goody bags. 
If, for some reason, you are unable to become a sponsor at this time you can still be a part of the tournament. Donations (any contributions under $500) are always welcome and will definitely help us to once again have a fist-class tournament. All donors will receive one time recognition on a special banner hung throughout the duration of the tournament.  
Would your company like to be a part of the DOD Team Bass Fishing Tournament for 2005?  If so, please contact Laticia Little no later than April 2, 2007 at (478) 926-6629.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 07-12 Location and Connectivity Aware Content Pushing (LOCO).  CLOSING DATE: One year from the date of publication in www.fbo.gov;  PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS DUE: NLT 1400, 12 April, 2007, POC: Tim Gibson, DARPA/STO; 3701 N. Fairfax Dr., Arlington, VA, 22203-1704.  Email: BAA07-12@darpa.mil; Website: http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicit/LOCO/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for LOCO.  The vision of the LOCO program is to provide information to commanders before they need it by anticipating their needs.  Current systems (e.g., file caches, peer-to-peer networks or Akamai-like systems) watch what users request and react by either moving data or shifting users to other data stores.  These techniques neither move the data beforehand nor work efficiently in bandwidth constrained military environments.  

DARPA requests proposals for two Technical Topic Areas supporting the LOCO program.  The first Topic Area covers the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).  The second area deals with test and evaluation.  Proposers may not bid against both areas.  Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies will be considered non-responsive to this BAA.

There will be a Proposer's Day starting at 8 am (0800), 27 February at the Executive Conference Center (ECC), 3601 Wilson Blvd, Suite 600, Arlington VA, 22201.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fbo.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal at any time up to the BAA closing date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 07-12) not later than 2 pm (1400, local Arlington VA time), 12 April, 2007  

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 Section 217 and PL 105-261 Section 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

This BAA plus the associated Program Information Pamphlet (PIP) constitute the full BAA and proposers must obtain and follow the details for submission set forth in the PIP.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement vehicle is subject to negotiation.  

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Your proposal must indicate which Technical Topic Area it is submitted against.  Proposals submitted against Technical Topic Area 1 (developing an end-to-end system to provide LOCO capabilities) will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the following areas in descending order of importance:  technical approach; potential for proposed effort to meet program metrics; ease of transitioning proposed technology into Defense Department networks; potential contribution and relevance to the DARPA Mission; and cost reasonableness and realism.    

Proposals submitted against Technical Topic Area 2 (build, maintain, and operate a testbed to evaluate LOCO technologies against LOCO program metrics) will be evaluated on the merit and relevance as it relates to following areas in descending order of importance:  ability to build, maintain, and operate a testbed to evaluate LOCO technologies against LOCO program metrics; potential contribution and relevance to the DARPA mission; and cost reasonableness and realism.   

Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

SECURITY:  The Government anticipates proposals submitted under this BAA will be unclassified.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal is provided in the PIP associated with this BAA.  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA may access these documents at www.fbo.gov.  

NOTE:  Do not contact the contracting officer identified below with respect to this announcement.  All questions should be sent to BAA07-12@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid to standardize and upgrade Public Access LANs at JFC HQ Brunssum, CC Air HQ Ramstein, and CC Land HQ Heidelberg.

The FRG is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The FRG intends to use the one-step/one-envelope bidding procedure.

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is BAWV-No. 68-05-11 (18/2006). The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-GERMANY-68-05-11.

Although it is planned to place contracts covering a/m works/services as a whole, the tender call may provide for a subdivision into separate lots.

Applications to supply private extension systems or other telecommunication installations that are to be connected with public telecommunications networks may only be submitted by firms licensed to do so by the Regulierungsbehorde fur Telekommunikation und Post (RegTP), Heinrich-von-Stephan-Strasse 1, 53175 Bonn ? Bad Godesberg. A photocopy of the license must be submitted with the application. 

Deposit for security of completion: Not applicable

The contract will be let as a fixed price contract with no variation clause or change of price for the performance time of the contract. 

The price proposal must be valid for a period of 6 months.

The bidder must ensure and confirm that existing property rights will be usable by NATO, NATO nations, and third parties contracted by them for maintenance and modification without recurring fees and cost for the lifetime of the items procured.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The procurement is to standardize and upgrade Public Access LANs throughout Allied Command Operations (ACO) in order to create an ACO-wide consistent baseline in the NU domain space. These services will take place at JFC HQ Brunssum, CC Air HQ Ramstein, and CC Land HQ Heidelberg. The procurement will include network components such as servers, switches, routers, workstations, and peripherals. It will also include the installation and integration of COTS hardware and software at the three locations.  

Personnel working on this project must be cleared for classified matters up to the degree of NATO SECRET. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 08 February 2007

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: 26 February 2007

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: 04 June 2007 

4. Anticipated contract award date: 16 July 2007

5. Approximate period of performance: 2007

The government will supply the bare optical fiber and Burnham Polymeric will apply the special high strength coating using their patented proprietary process.  This acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: The government spent many years attempting to find/establish a process that would yield a FOMC that would withstand the environmental stresses, marine biological attacks by crustaceans, imparted in the intended application.  Only Burnham Polymeric was able to develop a process that produces a FOMC that meets all size, 38 mil +/- 1 mil and 55 mil =/- 1 mil, and performance requirements, maximum attenuation per meter of the coated cable shall be 0.25dB per kilometer at the 1550 nm wavelength, 0.5 dB per kilometer at 1300 nm, and wit!  hstand 30 lb. (38 mil) and 60 lb. (55 mil) working tensile load with no attenuation degradation, and withstands attack by crustaceans.  A five-year firm fixed price indefinite delivery, requirements type contract, is anticipated.  Total quantities are estimated at 8.75 million meters of FOMC.  Specific delivery requirements will be stated in each order placed under the resultant contract.  Projected delivery rate will be up to 40,000 meters per week. Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018, unless otherwise noted in any individual order.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) in Washington, DC intends to award a Purchase Order to the University of Tulsa (UT), of Tulsa, OK, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   The purpose of this purchase order is to procure services for the analysis of student performance and indoor air quality.  Under this purchase order, the contractor shall analyze the potential association between IAQ and student performance using previously  collected data, from a well designed and implemented study in the school environment; and investigate potential enhancements to EPA's messages on IAQ and student performance through an examination of the associations between IAQ Tools for Schools guidance, improvements to the air quality of  schools, and improvements in student performance. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990 "All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services".    NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   It has been determined that  UT is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement as they are the only organization to have performed the extensive data gathering, linking indoor environmental measurements to student productivity in schools, which will be critical to this work. Very limited data actually assessing  the association between IAQ in school buildings and student performance and productivity exists. At this point in time, only two studies have been conducted linking indoor environmental measurements to student productivity in schools.  One study has been conducted by Dr. Pawel Wargocki of the  Technical University of Denmark on Danish schools.  The other study-- with a more extensive data set from American schools-- is presently being conducted by Dr. Richard Shaughnessy of the University of Tulsa (UT).  No other American researcher has published on this topic, making the UT data set  truly unique. The American study is more appropriate for EPA purposes since the study subjects-- American schools-- are truly representative in building age, facility design, facility operations and maintenance protocols, student demographics, etc. of U.S. schools, which means the results are  completely applicable to U.S. schools and do not require adjustments due to the factors listed above. This increases the validity of the results.  In addition, the Danish study is not as robust since the sample size is smaller. This small data pool decreases precision and possibly the significance,  resulting in less convincing findings. Larger data sets increase the precision confidence in study findings. The UT study is comprised of 54 schools, whereas the Danish study is comprised of one school. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated  herein may submit a capability statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement may be considered.  Responses to posting must be in writing and submitted to Nicole Humphrey, Contract Specialist at humphrey.nicole@epa.gov.  A determination not to compete the proposed  requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Nicole Humphrey, Contract Specialist via e-mail at humphrey.nicole@epa.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to advise interested parties that the Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to release a Requests for Proposals (RFP) for the services of a contractor to develop an automated, Section 508 compliant, profiling/screening tool (software) for identifying Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) disability decisions to FedBizOpps and will upload the solicitation document when issued.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the services of a contractor to develop an automated, Section 508 compliant*, profiling/screening tool (software) for identifying Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) disability decisions that are likely to be appealed to federal district court and remanded or reversed by the court.  The contractor may also recommend the purchase and/or modification of an existing Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software package for the profiling/screening tool if an existing product can be identified.

On March 31, 2006, SSA published the final rules establishing a new disability determination and administrative appeals process effective August 1, 2006.  Under the new rules SSA is gradually phasing out the Appeals Council?s review of disability claims and replacing it with a review by a Decision Review Board (DRB).  The DRB will focus on identifying decision-making errors as well as policies and procedures that will improve decision-making at all levels of the disability determination process. 

SSA intends to select ALJ decisions for review by the DRB in several different ways, including the use of computer-based predictive screening tools.  It is envisioned that a sophisticated computer-based profiling/screening tool could be developed to help identify unfavorable ALJ decisions that contain characteristics associated with federal district court appeals and remands or reversals.  The profiling model will be developed using data recorded at the time of the initial level determination, ALJ decision, Appeals Council review, and the court action.

The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for a solid state power amplifier, C-Band, 5.850-6.425 GHz, 100W, indoor, rack-mountable SSPA; Parallel I/O; 1:1 redundancy card for an SSPA, Mfg.: Vertex, Model #:  PCD6S100R-34; quantity two (2) each.  Requested delivery is approximately thirty (30) days after receipt of an award to Patrick AFB, Florida.  This is a Sole Source with General Dynamic, C4 System IAW FAR 6.302-1.  General Dynamic, C4 System is the only source capable of fulfilling the government?s requirement.  This Vertex amplifier model is to replace units currently being used that are part of an integrated commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) and is no longer manufactured.  However, General Dynamic has an inventory to fill this requirement.  No other product will satisfy the technical requirement as a suitable substitute for this acquisition due to the current communication system configuration and the cost of re-engineering the system.  This is a follow-on procurement for replacement of existing components of an operational system.  Since this component will no longer be manufactured, it is extremely important to obtain the needed replacements as soon as possible before they are no longer available.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.  This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 3663 with a business size of 750 employees and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 334220.  Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis.  45 CONS/LGCB has determined that General Dynamic, C4 System is the only source capable of providing this requirement.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD, intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price contract to procure technical and engineering support to modify four hundred fifty (450) CH-46E Engine Condition Control Boxes (ECCB), Logic P/N BCL 20-5.  The proposed contract will be awarded on a sole source basis to Logic, S.P.A., Cernusco Sul Naviglio, Italy.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The period of performance for this effort will be for eighteen (18) months after the date of contract award and the work will be performed at Logic in Cernusco Sul Naviglio, Italy.  The ECCBs will be modified so that potentiometers adjusted to a null position will fall in a travel range that reflects a -16 fuel control rather than the current -10 fuel control.  This change must be made without losing the existing adjustment fidelity and without inducting torque slits.  Additionally, the circuitry will be modified to enable fail freeze to be active beginning in the start position.  The existing beep trim circuitry will be modified to allow beep reset when the pilot selects manual trim reset in the cockpit.  Logic will also develop associated qualification and acceptance test procedures in order to perform the retrofit of these modifications into the ECCBs currently in service.  A minimum of twenty-five (25) ECCBs will be modified per month. 
Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of the Director (OD) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Dr. Arnold Kaluzny, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, to provide recommendation and guidance on evaluation strategies for the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP).   

The supplies and services herein are commercial as described in FAR Part 2 and the supplies and services are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.501.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is developing a program to accelerate the delivery of cancer care and research in community-based locations through the development of an NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP), which will enable the provision of state-of-the-art, multi-specialty care and early phase clinical trials.  The program will improve the reach to 80-85% of cancer patients across the country who do not have access to NCI-designated Cancer Centers.  The focus will be on creating sustainable programs to improve outcomes for:  1)  prevention, screening, and treatment;  2) increased participation in clinical trials (provide access to the earliest phase of translational research);  3) a reduction in healthcare disparities;  4)  increased participation in biospecimen initiatives to further translational research opportunities; and  5) advancement of NCI/HHS initiatives for Health Information Technology.  An evaluation plan of the program is required to develop both qualitative and quantitative metrics to measure success of the pilot program.  The contractor shall provide recommendation and guidance on evaluation strategies needed to convert these concepts into appropriate research questions, definition of metrics and evaluation criteria to measure success of the pilot.  Participation in specific evaluation components, advisory committees, and communication strategies are also required.


Contractor requirements:  The below supplies/services are required for this acquisition:  1) Provide information and samples of approaches to program evaluation;  2)  Provide examples of relevant, comparable program evaluations: 3) Provide examples of published articles on relevant program evaluations; 4) Provide recommendations and guidance for the development of a strategy to evaluate the specific pilot requirements; 5) Provide recommendations and guidance for the development of the RFP(s) for the evaluation contract(s); 6) Provide recommendations and guidance for the selection of the Evaluation Contractors; 7) Provide recommendations of membership for the Source Evaluation Group; 8) Provide recommendations and guidance for the formation and structuring of an Evaluation Oversight Subcommittee; 9) Provide guidance as a consultant on the Evaluation Oversight Subcommittee; 10) Provide recommendations and guidance regarding the oversight of the work of the Evaluation Contractor; and 11) Provide recommendations and guidance relative to the organizational aspects of the NCCCP program from the discipline of Organizational Behavior and knowledge of Community-based Cancer Programs.

Period of Performance:  Twelve (12) months upon date of award.

The evaluation of the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) requires both familiarity with NCI programs, community cancer care, as well as expertise in the review and evaluation process.  Dr. Arnold Kaluzny is uniquely qualified with this combination of knowledge base and skills.  It is critical, that in order to plan for the future, the development of an independent evaluation of the program is needed for monitoring the ongoing performance of the pilot sites and the program components.

Dr. Kaluzny has both the unique background and expertise to contribute to the evaluation plan of the NCCCP pilot program.   He is a nationally known evaluator of governmental institutions.  He is the author of ?Managing a Health Care Alliance ? Improving Community Cancer Care.?    His research has focused on organizational factors affecting program implementation and change in a variety of health care organizations, with specific emphasis given to cancer treatment, prevention and control, continuous quality improvement initiatives in both organizational and primary care settings, and most recently, the study of alliances within health care. In all these endeavors, a major focus has been to strengthen the science base of policy and practice.

Dr. Kaluzny has been associated with the NCI in a variety of roles for many years.    From 1991 through 1995 he was a member of the Board of Scientific Counselors for the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control at the National Cancer Institute, and served as the Chairman from 1993 to 1995.  

Dr. Kaluzny has served as a consultant to a number of private research organizations and various international, federal, and state agencies, including Project HOPE, the World Health Organization, the American College of Surgeons, the National Cancer Institute, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.

Dr. Kaluzny?s expertise with evaluation and review of programs combined with his extensive knowledge and understanding of the NCI and programs make him uniquely qualified to lead the development of an external evaluation process of the NCCCP program, which needs to be established prior to the launch of the program, the spring of 2007.   Dr. Kaluzny is the only known source with the appropriate expertise and knowledge of NCI who can fulfill the NCI?s requirements within the time specified.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Upgrade of existing BD Biosciences LSR II Flow Cytometer with Yellow (561 nm) Laser

Purpose/Brief History:

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to upgrade an existing BD Biosciences LSR II Flow Cytometry system, with a Yellow Laser (561 nm).   This upgrade will include in the installation proprietary electronics boards, fiber-optic cables, photomultiplier tube detectors, optical filters, and software alterations.

The FACS Core Facility provides flow cytometry support for CCR laboratories. Recent increased use of plasmids labeled with red fluorescent protein and the commercial development and subsequent popularity of RFP mutants means the facility needs a yellow laser to measure these proteins.  The yellow laser and its two (2) detectors will also be available for certain Alexa fluorochromes that have been commercially available for several years thus permitting more flexibility in complex experiments.

There are a number of CCR laboratories which are increasingly using plasmids double-labelled with RFP and luciferase in imaging of metastasis. Flow cytometric measurement of RFP expression correlates with luciferase expression; RFP is measured first (in vitro) as a guarantee that the cells will be expressing luciferase in vivo.

RFP can be paired with GFP, YFP, and/or CFP to look at multiple labels in single cells. Until recently, the red fluorescent proteins have been problematic in that they tend to dimerize. However, there is a new generation of RFPs (named tomato, cherry and strawberry) that remain as monomers and are being used by more and more CCR laboratories. All these RFPs require excitation by a yellow laser.

Alexa 568 is a fluorochrome commonly used in confocal microscopy; this probe can be measured on a flow cytometer with a yellow laser allowing investigators to correlate their confocal and flow results.

BD Biosciences is the only source known to NCI that offers an upgrade to the existing LSR II System manufactured by BD Biosciences. Also, the existing service contract with BD Biosciences might be voided if any non-BD Biosciences components were installed by a third party.


PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

The existing BD Biosciences LSR II Flow Cytometer was manufactured by BD Biosciences, and no other company can modify it to provide the needed upgrade.  Therefore, no other sources exist.

The report is critical to the Denali Commission mission; distressed communities can receive up to 80% of the funding necessary to construct community health facilities in rural Alaska. Non-distressed communities can only receive up to 50% of the necessary funds.

Communities are identified as distressed based on the following criteria:
1.  Per capita market income* no greater than 67% of the U.S. average
2.  150% of the U.S. average or greater of Poverty Rate*
3.  3 year unemployment rate* at 150 percent of the U.S. average or greater

Or have twice the U.S. poverty rate* and qualify on one other indicator.
*As defined by the State of Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DOL&WD).

The bulk of the raw data used to create this report is gathered, maintained and interpreted by the State of Alaska DOLWD. The remainder of the data is collected by State entities and is not accessible by non-State entities, as it is collected on an individual basis. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541611, and the size standard is $6.5 Million.

No solicitation package will be issued.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by January 25, 2007. 

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Inputs to the Transformational Communications Architecture

General:  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information that will help the National Security Space Office (NSSO) / Communications Functional Integration Office (COMM-FIO) updates of the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA).  The TCA defines an integrated Department of Defense (DOD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) communications architecture to support national level communications.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, DISA is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist DISA in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this RFI.

1.0 Description.  The purpose of this RFI is to incorporate current and future COMSATCOM capabilities into the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA) version 3.  Inputs will be evaluated by a DISA led COMSATCOM working group in support of the NSSO/COMM-FIO.  Opportunities to present inputs or updated information may be arranged at a future point.  Sufficient interest and participation by industry may warrant that materials be discussed in a face-to-face setting or for potential group meetings to reach a consensus on COMSATCOM architecture attributes.

2.0 Background.  The current TCA, version 2, addresses COMSATCOM augmentation to support ongoing and surge bandwidth capacity requirements.  An objective of the planned TCA update will be to address an expanded potential role for COMSATCOM and to leverage emerging commercial satellite capabilities, which would support transformational goals out to the 2020+ timeframe.  The state of the commercial industry will be assessed in several time segments, i.e., near-term (within 5 years from the present), mid-term (10 years out) and far term (2015+).  In order to best accomplish this, DOD requests industry?s assistance through response to this RFI which will constitute commercial industry?s formal opportunity to contribute to an updated TCA.

DOD is soliciting commercial capabilities that can be applied as open architectural solutions to meet specific military needs or opportunities.  These needs and opportunities include but are not limited to:

A.	Mobile Satellite Service
	L-band
	S-band
	Other bands
B.	Fixed Satellite Service
	C-band
	X-band
	Ku-band
	Ka-band
C.	Specific SATCOM applications
	Handheld communications
	Comm-on-the-move (COTM)
	Airborne (aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) communications
	Shipboard communications
	Modem technology
	Antenna technology
	Quality of service applications (QoS)
D. Narrowband netted communications capability augmentation and means to satisfy them (e.g., use of existing service, use of planned service, opportunities for hosted payloads, etc.)
E. Wideband communications capability augmentation and means to satisfy them (e.g., use of existing service, use of planned service, opportunities for hosted payloads, etc.)
F. Existing or innovative opportunities and approaches to assure long term access to COMSATCOM services (e.g., pre-positioned leases, hosted payloads, portable capacity, etc.) that provide flexibility, given the uncertainties of DOD operating areas, durations, or funding availability, etc.
G. Available infrastructure (e.g., terrestrial networks, earth terminals, etc.) capabilities and recommendations on whether such capabilities are best leveraged through use of industry organic infrastructure or DOD-specific infrastructure investment

(These needs and opportunities are not intended to be exhaustive or mutually exclusive.) 

3.0 Requested Information.

3.1 Written Responses.  E-mail responses to the questions are due to the Contracting Officer not later than 3:00 p.m. CDT, FRIDAY, 26 JANUARY 2007.  Responses shall be submitted in writing via e-mail only to Pamilla Lazare at pamilla.lazare@disa.mil  and Cindy Showers at cindy.showers@disa.mil.  E-mail responses shall be titled in the subject line of the e-mail as follows:  ?Response to TCA v3 COMSATCOM RFI?.  Responses should be contained in a Microsoft Word (.doc), Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt), or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) document and be as concise as possible.  Shorter, more succinct inputs that clearly demonstrate the military need / opportunity that the capability can address are more valuable than lengthy general responses.

3.2 Proprietary information, if any, should be used sparingly if necessitated and must be clearly marked on the outside container and materials inside.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  DISA intends to utilize contractor support personnel, as listed below, to assist in reviewing and evaluating responses.  If any respondent does not currently have a Proprietary Data Protection Agreement (PDPA) that would permit the Government support contractors listed below to review and evaluate responses to this RFI, the respondent is requested to sign PDPAs with these Government support contractors for this purpose.
	- Northrop Grumman IT (NGIT) / TASC
	- SAIC
	- Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc.
	- Aerospace Corporation
	- Other contractors as identified by DISA or COMM-FIO
A sample PDPA will be provided upon request by contacting points of contact listed in Paragraph 4.0.
 
3.3 All respondents should be aware that inputs will be made available across the entire Government enterprise and viewed by Government and industry personnel.  Accordingly, the architecture will not include proprietary information.  Thus, proprietary inputs must be kept to an absolute minimum.  Also, bear in mind we will adhere to statutory and regulatory responsibilities for ensuring a fair and equitable application of industry capabilities.  Therefore, gratuitous recommendations such as exclusive reliance on one vendor?s proprietary solutions or sole-source arrangements to leverage capabilities that exist from multiple sources within the marketplace will not be considered in respect to the information required by this RFI.  Also, ?glossy? marketing brochures are not to be submitted.

3.4  The RFI response shall be comprised of two (2) sections.

3.4.1  Section 1 of the response shall provide administrative information, and shall include the following as a minimum (there is no page limitation for Section 1).

3.4.1.1  Name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact (POC).

3.4.1.2  Please provide a statement that the respondent will allow or not allow the Government to release proprietary data to the Government support contractors identified above.  If the respondent provides consent, please include a signed copy of the Proprietary Data Protection Agreement (PDPA) in place between the Government and the support contractors identified above.

3.4.1.3  Please provide a statement if you would like the opportunity to present materials in a face-to-face setting.  Such exchanges will likely be held at the NSSO in Fairfax, VA.

3.4.2	Section 2 of the response shall provide the information requested below.  Section 2 of the response is limited to twenty (20) pages.

a) Describe current and planned capabilities to address military needs or opportunities including any other potential applications that are not highlighted above;
b) Clearly indicate if a capability is currently available and / or provide the projected timeline for future capabilities;
c) Describe the delivery mechanisms that you are using / exploring for current / projected capabilities such as static leases, per minute charges, per megabyte charges, time-period based (e.g., monthly, annual) managed service plans, and the like;
d) Indicate whether the capabilities are already being pursued through corporate or private equity investment or require specific DOD investment to realize;
e) Address the constraints of any proposed hosted payload opportunities such as lead times / schedules, weight and power, frequency filing / orbital slots, regulatory issues, etc.; and,
f) Highlight new technologies and standards that you are developing, adopting, or recommend for adoption / investment.

4.0 Questions.  Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing via e-mail to the DITCO to Pamilla Lazare at pamilla.lazare@disa.mil and Cindy Showers at cindy.showers@disa.mil.  Verbal questions will NOT be accepted.  All questions will be answered via posting answers to the FEDBIZOPPS website; accordingly, questions shall NOT contain trade secrets or classified information.  The Government does not guarantee that questions received after 19 January 2007 will be answered.

5.0 Summary.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can provide information that will help the National Security Space Office (NSSO)/Communications Functional Integration Office (COMM-FIO) update the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA).  The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.  The DISA has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of Overseas Buildings Operations, Facilities Management Division is seeking to pre-qualify firms for Design-Build maintenance and repair projects at various Foreign Service Posts worldwide.     The Government anticipates award of up to four (4) indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contracts to licensed firms specializing in building envelope, roofing and waterproofing design-build projects.     Two of the contracts will be set aside for small business.     The small business size standard North American Industry Classification system code is 238160,     $13 million average, based on the annual average gross revenue of a firm which has been in business for three or more years. 

Each Contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year optional service periods. The Government guarantees a minimum of $20,000 in task orders over the life of the Contract.     The maximum dollar value of Task Orders issued under this Contract shall not exceed $3,000,000 per year; the total Contract amount over five years shall not exceed $15,000,000.     Task Orders will be competed between the selected firms. The competitive selection process for individual task orders will be based on a firm fixed price to include all expenses (travel and lodging).     The cost of the Government required Defense Base Act Insurance shall be a direct reimbursable.     The Government reserves the right to make award of individual task orders estimated to be less than $750,000 on a sole source direct negotiation basis under this Contract.

Task Orders shall include, but are not limited to, cost and schedule proposals; pre-award on-site investigations; building envelope, roofing and waterproofing contract documentation for design-build to include specifications and calculations; construction and workmanship warranty services; and related requirements for maintenance and repair projects worldwide.     Submissions under this contract shall be compliant with Office of Overseas Buildings Operations guidelines and compatible with Autocad Release 2000.     The work must comply with applicable U.S. and foreign building codes, regulations, and standards.     The anticipated design-build cost of these Task Orders will range from $250,000 to $3,000,000, depending on specific design limitations, locations and security parameters.       Roof replacement and repair work will account for approximately 75-percent of the Task Orders.

Professional Design services may include architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, historic preservation, sustainability, curtain wall, roofing, fire, life safety, hazardous material and specification expertise.     Design submission phases will be identified in a design recommendation report and performance specification provided by the Government with each task order and will typically require Design Development (50%) and Final Design (100%).     All submissions shall be sealed and signed by a licensed professional.     Submissions may include product submittals and material procurement for fast-track projects.     Overseas Buildings Operations will review each Design submission and comments will be returned to the design-build firm for incorporation into the Design and Construction.

Construction services may include providing all labor, equipment, and materials to execute the design; schedule and cost control; shipping logistics and mobilization; safety planning and implementation; on-site quality control personnel to ensure overall project coordination; overall means and methods throughout the life of the project; acceptance testing; and projects closeout services.     Only U.S. personnel will be allowed to perform specific Construction in specified areas.     Not all Construction will require U.S. personnel therefore the use of foreign labor may be employed for some tasks.     Some building products may be procured from foreign sources. (Reference the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 25, Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Programs).       Labor requirements and a list of materials that don't have to be "U.S. End Source Products" will be identified in each task order.     

Upon notification of Selection, each successful offeror will be required to submit a copy of its labor rate schedule for U.S. personnel within twenty working days for review and approval.

<DESC>The government anticipates negotiating and awarding a contract under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, only one acceptable source that can meet the requirements.  This project is a continuation of previously phased projects to stabilize the shoreline along MacDill AFB, Florida, through the construction of oyster reefs which form a shallow wave-energy barrier.  A demonstration project (Phase I), completed in 2004, was used to determine which configuration of oyster domes was most effective at reducing wave energy and stabilizing the shoreline.  Special environmental funding shall be used for this project.  Matching funds from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and possibly, funds from the Tampa Bay Estuary Program and the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County may also be expected for partnering with Tampa Baywatch, a local, nonprofit organization, that has performed the prior four phases of the shoreline stabilization.  Interested sources that believe they can provide this service are asked to contact Ms Debra K. Parent at e-mail: Debra.Parent@macdill.af.mil.   Please submit your e-mail no later than 25 January 2007, 4:30 PM EST.

<CONTACT>Helen Nelson, Administrative Assistant, Phone 860-441-2843, Fax 860-441-2888, Email helen.r.nelson@uscg.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (RDC) IN GROTON, CT.  This RFI is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the USCG's needs.  You are invited to respond with information to assist the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Research and Development Center (R&DC) Search and Rescue (SAR) Program in market research to identify suitable real-time information products that can be used to represent the environmental parameters that should be considered for the USCG's search planning tool, the Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System (SAROPS). These parameters include surface winds and ocean currents that affect the movement of survivors in the ocean, air and water temperatures that affect the survivability of victims, and wave height and atmospheric conditions that affect search methods and efficiency. To support the USCG SAR mission, these parameters must understandably be available on a continuous basis and represent present conditions with a minimum of time delay, as well as those expected for the next 72 hours. 
   
BACKGROUND:
The most recent USCG contracting effort to upgrade/deploy SAROPS is Task Order HSCG23-06-F-TEY164 issued to Northrop Grumman under GSA schedule GS-35F-4506G.  SAROPS is for nationwide use by USCG SAR controllers to plan and execute SAR operations. SAROPS will be applied to the coastal areas of the continental U.S., Caribbean, Alaska, and Hawaii.  Also included are areas of the western Atlantic Ocean, and areas of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to U.S. territories. 

The R&DC has been supporting the development of SAROPS by identifying suitable real-time environmental data products for USCG areas of responsibility. A contract was issued to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) where a team, headed by SAIC, conducted its market research effort in late 2005 and early 2006, obtaining information from 59 potential providers. The project team was not able to obtain information from all providers of potential interest. As a result, this RFI is being conducted to complete the market research effort.  SAIC is not participating in this RFI effort.
 


USCG NEEDS:
The USCG is researching atmospheric and oceanographic parameters available for the present and near-future (e.g. next 72 hours) time frame that impact SAR and other USCG missions. These include ocean surface currents, surface winds, sea surface temperature, air temperature, and other parameters that would affect the ability of CG vessels and aircraft to operate and locate victims on the ocean. For the purpose of this RFI, a website with a questionnaire has been established to simplify the collection of responses from providers.  At this website a complete listing of parameters is provided on the questionnaire login page.  The attributes of environmental information products will be examined in the following areas: 
(1) Operational Status attributes: Products that are available on a continuing basis, with a history of minimum interruption in recent service are preferred, as are model products that are updated more frequently and with longer prediction horizons. The USCG is interested in observing products that are made available with smaller time delays. The USCG is also interested in information on infrastructure redundancy in place to support product continuity;  
(2) Access attributes: Products that are presently available continuously in electronic format and the availability of on-line archived observations or model fields are desired. Is a fee required for access to the product?;
(3) Domain, Applicability, and Resolution attributes: The USCG places more value on model products that provide small-scale resolution of parameters in space (horizontally and vertically), and in time; 
(4) Quality attributes: Information is needed on the processes followed (i.e. QA/QC) to ensure that observational and model products are representative of actual values. 
All interested persons, who have not previously responded to the questionnaire are requested to complete an on-line questionnaire form at the R&DC SAR Program website at http://www.rdc.uscg.gov/sar/. The questionnaire is most efficiently completed on-line, however a MS Word version of the questionnaire is also available at the website. 

Respondents are requested to complete this questionnaire by 15 February 2007. Those who have previously responded to the initial questionnaire need not respond to this inquiry unless the production of their product has changed during the past year. 

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  The Government requests that no proprietary information be provided in response to this RFI.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

Inquiries regarding this RFI shall be sent directly to Helen.R.Nelson@uscg.mil with a copy to Arden.C.Turner@uscg.mil.  Only electronic responses will be accepted and shall be submitted no later than 15 February 2007.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY (SOUCES SOUGHT) AND NOT A SOLICITATION.  THE RFI IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING CAPABILITY INFORMATION FROM VENDORS OUTLINING HOW THEY CAN SATISFY THE POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS.  The Department of State's (DoS) Bureau of Resource Management, Office of Budget and Planning is reviewing whether or not to replace our current budget formulation, budget execution, and publication tool with either a Government-off-the-Shelf/Commercial-off-the Shelf (GOTS/COTS) or vendor developed product.  To assist the Department in the our effort, we are conducting this Request for Information of possible solutions that incorporate all of the components necessary for the Department to formulate and execute the DoS world-wide budget.  We expect that the acquired tool shall meet the Department's requirements with minimal configuration and enable us to manage all budget data electronically via a centralized and secure database integrated with a collaborative, document-sharing, workflow-driven, user-friendly design.  It must also empower users to formulate budgets seamlessly and comply with OMB Circulars A-11 and A-123, while also offering the flexibility to address changes or deviations in budget guidance from year to year and meet Budget and Performance Integration initiative goals associated with the President's Management Agenda.  Please note that we are not looking for a federal accounting system (e.g. we do not record obligations in it).

The system will reside on the Department's network and warehouse resource information used to display budget data by appropriation, agency, program activity, accounting object class, and strategic and performance goal.  Users will be allowed to access and configure budget information and generate customized reports and analyses to meet key stakeholders' expectations.  These reports and analyses will be used in the development of the Department's budget submissions as well as to fulfill senior leadership reporting requirements for greater internal governance and control.  The multi-faceted solution must encompass key features such as:

Budget formulation and publication; 
Budget execution; 
Budget reporting, analytics, and ?what if? scenario creation; 
Centralized budget data calls and historical information recordation; 
Future out-year systems integration to support performance measures and Exhibit 300 development.

Any GOTS/COTS or vendor developed system must meet all of the Department's requirements, including those outlined on the attached spreadsheets.  Under each tab (GOTS/COTS or vendor developed), please check whether or not you have a product that meets those criteria and then answer the cost and administrative categories requirements sections.  PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  Disclaimer:  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and can not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  The Department makes no implied or in fact contract by issuing and publishing this market survey.  Vendor submission of responses and contact information: Electronic responses to this Request for Information are required.  Please submit responses via email in Microsoft Excel or Adobe pdf format no later than 4:00 pm EST on Thursday, January 25, 2007, to: Baranej@state.gov.  Please contact Edward Baran via email with any questions related to this RFI.  No telephone calls please.  Point of Contact: Edward Baran, Contract Specialist, 703-516-1708, BaranEJ@state.gov.

<DESC>1.	Synopsis
The GovBenefits.gov Program, managed by the Department of Labor, is gathering high-level marketplace capability information in anticipation of a future request for proposal fulfilling requirements for Program, Project and Web site Management services in Washington, DC.
These services will include but are not limited to:
1.	Program and Project Management support
2.	Stakeholder Relations and Outreach
3.	Planning, Tracking and Control
4.	Web site Development and Operation
5.	Measurement and Metrics
6.	Other Program Support
The Department of Labor (DOL) implemented the GovBenefits.gov Program (??the Program??) and Web sites in 2002. DOL is the Managing Partner for this E-Government Presidential initiative. The Program will seek to acquire the resources necessary to support the Program Management Office (PMO) with program, project, and Web site management activities. 
The Program??s Web sites are hosted by the United States Department of Agriculture??s (USDA) National Information Technology Center. The Web sites use BEA??s WebLogic Portal, Vignette??s Content Management System (CMS), and Oracle??s database applications on Sun hardware. The Web sites receive 4 to 6 million visitors per year.
The scope of this work will include services and other direct costs to the GovBenefits.gov program under guidance provided by the DOL Program Manager. It is anticipated that the final award will be a Blanket Purchase Agreement utilizing multiple government award schedules.
The Period of Performance for this support is anticipated to begin on or about April 30, 2007, and end on or about April 29, 2012. The following will describe the needs of the program for services in the primary service groups.
2.	Primary Service Groups
Many of the requirements, activities, and deliverables of the Program will require an integrated, team approach. The services required will support the Program Management Office, which is responsible for managing all the activities and work products of the Program. 
Program and Project Management (PPM) will insure the program and its activities accomplish the Program mission and support its stakeholders. The PPM is the face of the Program and provides strategic leadership and tactical management of the program??s operations and processes.  The PPM will operate to ensure the success of the program by providing resources, planning, organizing, coordinating and executing a variety of known and ad hoc tasks. 
Planning, Tracking and Control (PCT) will support the program by implementing formal program and project management processes which align with DOL or other government control requirements, assign resources to tasks, monitor, measure, and report progress towards goals. Project management tools and methodologies such as represented by the Project Management Institute??s (PMI) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and Earned Value Management (EVM) will be required. Project Planning, Tracking and Control requires activity, process, resource, and time management tools (e.g. EVM methods, Microsoft??s Project, etc) and skills applied to meet program management goals, DOL process controls, OMB or other project management and reporting requirements. Program planning, tracking and control activities will require the contractor to apply formal project tools and methodologies to coordinate the efforts of the project, achieve project financial and project goals, and manage and report resource usage to the Program, DOL, the Partners and OMB. 
Stakeholder Relations and Outreach will support (1) increasing awareness of the website among stakeholders, citizens and those who assist citizens in gaining access to government benefits. (2) managing the operational processes and support for the workings of  the partnerships with Federal, State, local government and other involved stakeholders and their contributions to the Web site(s). Stakeholder Relations and Outreach requires appropriately skilled resources to manage stakeholder processes and generate materials to support those processes and create collateral outreach materials to accomplish the SRO goals of the program.
Web site Management support focuses on three primary objectives (1) ensuring that user needs are fully represented in product design and development, (2) maintaining site operations in accordance with the software development lifecycle and compliance with applicable regulations, and (3) designing and implementing system enhancements that further improve the user experience and advance the mission of E-Gov.  The Contractor will bring the necessary tools for all aspects of development and testing to the task; the Program will only be responsible for the ownership of the core component software. Web Development and Operations requires skilled resources necessary to manage the hosting, site design, application development, testing, and deployment of the Program??s Web site(s). Web site and Management requires consideration of the Program??s goals, the user experience, the target market needs, legal and budgetary constraints, and feedback from stakeholders and program metrics.
The Measurement and Metrics task involves measuring, analyzing, and reporting the performance of the program and its assets. The contractor must be able to gather, analyze, interpret, document, and present performance metrics. Metrics will be shared internally, publicly, with DOL management, other organizations, and will reflect not only the progress of the Program, but also the outcome of its activities. Measurement and Metrics require the contractor to have a thorough understanding of the purpose, tools, and methods for measuring program and product performance.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center research facility of the National Institutes of Health serves the patient care and clinical research needs of the NIH intramural research program.  Its mission is to provide patient care services, training, and the environment in which NIH clinician-scientists creatively translate emerging knowledge into better understanding, detection, treatment, and prevention of human diseases.  On an annual basis, the Clinical Center admits approximately 7,000 patients and supports over 100,000 outpatient visits.  Patients seen at the Clinical Center come from all over the world to participate in research protocols aimed at developing new knowledge of disease processes, new treatments, and expanded comprehension of basic biologic systems.

The office of Financial Resources Management (OFRM), CC provides efficient and effective financial management of programs that fully support the CC and the NIH in meeting its goals and objectives.  OFRM is responsible for managing all of the CC financial operations to include: developing and monitoring the annual hospital operating budget; identifying Institute cost and volume utilization information; developing impact assessments for new protocols and initiatives; performing financial and workload audit and control functions; defining business requirements for new clinical information systems and supporting modules that document and monitor patient care; and developing presentation and support materials for various NIH and hospital governing bodies.  The strategic goal and the continuation of the goal is that the CC/OFRM began the design and development of a hospital Executive Information System (EIS) to allow participating NIH Institutes the ability to quickly access and analyze information across a broad range of hospital functions.

The initial phase of the EIS initiative was to develop patient census dashboards for hospital and IC leadership.  Each dashboard contains hospital patient statistics including inpatient and outpatient census, admissions, average daily census, etc.  This phase of the initiative was achieved in January 2004.  Simultaneously a continuation of the development started in the creation of a hospital executive dashboard with key organizational performance indicator which was implemented in April, 2004. The completion of this pilot dashboard primarily focused on maintaining and the current system and dashboards, with some additional evaluation to include clinical service metrics.

In 2005, the system underwent a major upgrade to a new software version and the main EIS dashboards were re-engineered for improved speed.  Also, the patient census dashboard was expanded to include new content, including Average Length of Stay (ALOS), patient discharge, and new patient count information.  

In the beginning of 2006, project work included much-needed enhancements to the existing system architecture and database machines; a complete re-design of the system?s ad-hoc reporting module; and training users.

In mid 2006, EIS development work included expansion of the system to include Central Hospital Supplies (CHS)/Lawson cost data in both CHS Dashboard and CHS Ad-Hoc Reporting Modules and training users.

The current phase of EIS work began in September.  This phase includes expansion of the EIS to include  new outpatient visit related data elements from Scheduling.com for ad-hoc reporting; expansion of the CHS/Lawson module and deployment to additional users; standardization of hospital locations across projects for consistent reporting; creation of a monitoring project; research into making the system Section 508-compliant; and training users.

The next phase of EIS work is slated to begin in February 2007.  This phase will include expansion of the EIS to include patient quality performance indicator information, specifically in a dashboard; addition of off-site outpatient visits to the existing census data in the system; standardization of hospital locations in the Census Dashboard and Census Ad-Hoc Modules for consistent reporting; developing and deploying a data dictionary project; and training users.

Evaluation Criteria:  It is essential that the consultant possess the below certification(s), skills, training, and experience.  These are required and essential to the EIS project.  The below necessary certification(s) skills training and experience must be possessed by the individual proposed to perform the work.  Also, the below must be possessed by an individual currently employed by the company offering the proposal.  1) The consultant must be a MicroStrategy Certified Engineering Principal (MCEP).

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY).

The Cannon Load Bank L-3 System is the best possible product to support the 290th JCSS Tactical Quiet Generators.  We currently have seven L-63 load banks at the 290th JCSS and have the requirement for one more.  We need to keep all of our load bank systems the same for generator system and maintenance uniformity.  The weight, size, and features all meet the 290th JCSS specifications which will keep all power production systems the same.  Uniformity is important because it will allow all generators to be the same and interchangeable.  Also, no further training will need to be provided.  This will also allow us to account for the equipment on the same equipment detail and on the supply equipment account.  Furthermore, it will also keep our entire generator configuration lists, aircraft load lists, and evacuation lists the same and uniform for all of our generators.

Lumeta Enterprises will be assisting DISA personnel with successful deployment of IPsonar.  Once deployed, this will provide DISA with Situational Awareness of the global network (SIPRNet and NIPRNet), including the customer enclaves.  This will detail any unauthorized hosts or unauthorized connections to the network as well as itemizing network anomalies that deviate from security policy.  5.   Scope.

The Government intends to make an award to a single offeror who can provide all items identified and as specified herein. Successful offeror shall be the responsive responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Technical acceptability of item offered to meet Government requirement to include detailed outline/description of training offered (2) Price and price related factors. Inquiries and information received after the established deadline shall not be considered for this particular acquisition. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Only written responses will be accepted. E-mail responses must be in MS Word, Excel or PDF format. Technical and/or administrative questions must be submitted in writing to Charlotte.Laughlin@dhs.gov or Ella.Chapman@dhs.gov.  All responses to this notice shall be received no later than December 21, 2006, 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST).   


The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase. 


1.   Agency and Contracting Activity:  The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Grants and Training, the Preparedness Directorate, Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP),  Anniston, Alabama, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition.


2.   Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved.  The CDP requested approval to solicit for a specific "brand name" purchase, installation and training for a Motorola MCC 7500 IP Dispatch Console Radio System for the CDP Operations Center.  The Motorola System is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  This system would enhance the current CDP Motorola XTL5000 Consolette Base Station, 800 MHz emergency services radio system capabilities that is in use in the CDP Operations Center. 


3.   Description of Supplies/Services.  This requirement is for the purchase, installation and training for the Motorola MCC 7500 IP Dispatch Console Radio System.  The Motorola MCC 7500 is a compatible and integrated component with the ASTRO 25 Trunking System and is fully compatible and can be integrated with the existing CDP 800 MHZ radio system for continued interoperability and effective communications.  The MCC 7500 will connect directly to the IP (Internet Protocol) network without interface boxes, digital voice gateways, or backroom electronics. In addition, the MCC 7500 does not require a Central Electronics Bank (CEB).  This system will allow the CDP to continue to be compatible with the local emergency management community. This "brand name" Motorola, is the only known source that can provide the equipment, upgrades and integration for this system.  


4.  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (5) as stated in FAR 6.302-1, entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements".


5.  Demonstration that the Nature of the Acquisition Required Use of the Authority Cited.  The CDP emergency communication system was upgraded in 2005 with the Motorola XLT 5000 Consolette Base Station, 800 MHz emergency services radio system. This is the only radio system that currently provides the critical interoperability and communications between the CDP and the Calhoun County Emergency Management community during emergency operations.  The CDP's  radio system uses and takes advantage of the Calhoun County Emergency Radio system and infrastructure.  The CDP benefits from the Calhoun County FCC license, frequency and access to other emergency services.   


The Calhoun County Emergency Management community is in the process of upgrading their current system to a Motorola ASTRO 25 Trunking System. In order for the CDP to continue to communicate effectively and preclude any delays in the time of crisis, the CDP system has to be compatible with the Calhoun County Emergency Management system. The Motorola MCC 7500 is a compatible and integrated component with the ASTRO 25 Trunking System that can be fully compatible and integrated with the existing CDP 800 MHZ radio system.  


Integration of the MCC 7500 positions with the current radio system would enable full participation in end-to-end voice encryption for secure communication, priority handling of emergency calls, and agency partitioning. 


6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  Efforts have been made to identify other contractors for this requirement by synopsizing this requirement in FedBizOpps; the single government point-of-entry (GPE) for Federal government procurement opportunities. All interested Motorola dealers/distributors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in the acquisition.


7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.  The Contracting Officer hereby determines that the cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable based upon sufficient competition obtained by posting the combined synopsis/solicitation to FedBizOpps and the vendor's commercial product price list.


8.  Description of Market Research.  Upon initial receipt of this requirement, a market survey was conducted to determine if this requirement could be solicited among small businesses under the GSA Schedule.  It was determined that this was a new state-of-the art product and was not on GSA schedule with Motorola or its suppliers.  Based upon this information, market research was limited to the Motorola Government Sales Representative exploring options that would provide an upgrade to the existing CDP system and be compatible with the upgraded system to be installed within the Calhoun County emergency management community.


9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.  
As an integral member of the Calhoun County emergency management community it is essential that equipment used by the CDP be compatible with the equipment used by the local emergency management community. To do otherwise would jeopardize the CDP's ability to interact and communicate effectively with the local emergency management community.  If the CDP cannot effectively communicate and interact in a time of crisis, it would significantly impact safety and human life.


10.   A Listing of the Sources, if any, that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.  The only source considered for this procurement action is Motorola and its dealers/distributors. No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition.


11.  A statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition of supplies or services are required.   No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition will be taken, as the Motorola "brand name" MCC 7500 IP Dispatch Console Radio System is the only known system capable of satisfying this agency?s requirement. 


12.  Contracting Officer's Certification.

I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Scope of Work for Modifications to the Existing Chiller Plant at Fort Defiance Indian Hospital:

1.	Convert the two cooling tower two-speed fans to variable-speed operation. The towers were manufacturer by Marley Cooling Tower Company and the Model is 22215 QUADAFLOW. Work will involve removing the existing motors and starters, furnishing and installing new 40 hp, premium-efficiency severe duty motors, furnishing and installing new 40 hp NEMA 1 variable-frequency drives (VFDs), and new external oil pumps for gearboxes. Work includes power wiring of motor, VFS,s and oil pumps, wiring the VFDs to be controlled by the Johnson Controls? Metasys EMCS (Energy Management and Control System), programming and commissioning of the EMCS.

2.	Convert the condensing water pumps to variable-speed operation. Work will involve removing existing starters, furnishing and installation of two 40 hp VFDs, NEMA 1 to the existing pumps for flows to be efficiently controlled and easily adjusted. This includes power wiring of VFSs, wiring the VFDs to be controlled by the Johnson Controls? Metasys EMCS (Energy Management and Control System), programming and commissioning of the EMCS.

3.	Automate the existing variable-frequency drives on the chilled water loop. Chillers are YORK International Model YT (Style J). The existing VFDs are manually set to a constant speed. The VFDs must be connected to the EMCS, which will control them and the bypass valve to ensure proper chilled water flow through the chillers and adequate supply to the cooling coils around the facility.  The flow through the chillers should be scaled to the load with the minimum chilled water flow.  Work will involve furnishing and installing two differential pressure transducers, EMCS wiring for transducers and VFDs, and EMCS programming and commissioning. 

4.	Once all items 1 through 3 above have been completed, optimize the chiller plant controls to minimize energy and water use. For any combination of cooling load and outside humidity, there is an optimal combination of condenser temperature and flow and chilled water temperature and flow that minimizes the energy and water use of the plant.  Implement an optimal control strategy to monitor the plant, and adjust the set points in order to achieve optimal operation. Develop algorithm and sequence and program it into the EMCS.  Commission the work.

Response: The contractors are not expected to bring their own expertise of the federal student financial aid system. Expert opinion is based on data from the 2-day workshop.

A1. (1)UPS A, 225 kVA has 2 external battery strings with 40 batteries on each strings which  equals 480 cells.
(2)UPS B, 225kVA has 2 external battery strings with 40 batteries on each strings which equals 480 cells.
(3)UPS C, 500kVA has 2 external battery strings with 80 batteries on each strings which equals 960 cells.

Q2. On line item 0004 & 0005, are you looking for a price for one time battery replacement quote for total quantity of 320 batteries? and what year will we be replacing all batteries? 

A2. (1)UPS A, All batteries were replaced in 2005.
       (2)UPS B, All battries were replaced in 2004.
       (3)UPS C, is the latest model, manufactured and installed in 2006 with new batteries.

During the last year of the contract any batteries that have not replaced in four years must be replaced.  The intent is to have all batteries in each UPS replaced during the contract performance.  As batteries are found weak or defective, the batteries should be replaced during preventive maintenance and inspections. 

Q3. You have a brand new UPS (your line item 0002) which comes off warranty later this year.  Will you want is done on this UPS (and external battery cabinets) DURING warranty?

A3. Yes, our new 500kva UPS and external battery storage cabinets are included in this maintenance contract.  The warranty expiration date for the UPS C is June 1, 2007.  Therefore, the Preventive Maintenance  will be start from June 2, 2007.

Q4. On line item 0007, you mentioned DC Cap replacement quantity 12 for UPS B and 16 for UPS A. Since both UPS are 225 KVA, will you confirm the cap. numbers are right?. 

A4. UPS A was manufactured 01/1991 and UPS B was manufactured 08/2001, the  difference in age explains why UPS A has 16 capacitors versus UPS B with 12 capacitors.

Q5. You requested that s Preventive Maintenance be performed during normal M-F 8-5 unless the UPS must come OFFLINE.   We put the equipment in bypass (utility power) when performing maintenance.  Can this be done during business hours? Or do you want pricing to encompass all possible hours?
