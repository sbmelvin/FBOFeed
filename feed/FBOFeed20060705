<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Geology Discipline, Coastal and Marine Geology Team (USGS) is responsible for conducting research on coastal processes, coastal change, and coastal hazards. The Coastal Evolution: Process-based, Multi-scale modeling project intends to develop and apply numerical models to examine these issues on a wide variety of scales.  The team requires the expertise of a contractor to assist with the development and application of state-of-the-art models to studies at prior, present, and future field sites. This will be a negotiated acquisition in accordance with (IAW) the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.  Full and open competition will be provided for.  This acquisition is set aside for participation by small business concerns, under NAICS code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services, for which the associated size standard is $6.5 million in average (last three years) annual revenue.  The USGS is contemplating a contract with one base year and one option year. A brief description of the required services follows. The contractor shall: 1) Provide assistance with the modeling of coastal processes using the Delft3D and NearCoM models.  The contractor should have experience with the model components, including FLOW, SWAN, REFDIF-S, and SHORECIRC.  This includes the creation of both flow and wave modeling grids from bathymetric data, model calibration and validation, sensitivity studies, and visualizations of model output. 2) Compare field observations of waves, hydrodynamics, and morphological evolution to the predictions of numerical models.  Time series and statistics of observed data shall be compared with model predictions.  Model accuracy and errors shall be quantified. 3) Compare field observations of runup and swash.  Time series images of runup and swash obtained from remote video monitoring will be utilized and compared to model predictions of run-up and water level due to wave setup and wind setup.   4) Compare field observations of shoreline change and morphological evolution of the nearshore region to model predictions.  A methodology for applying model results to predict shoreline change will be developed and the results of simulations will be compared to recent observations using all terrain vehicles, personal watercraft, and remote imaging system. Complete specifications and required deliverables will be provided with the Request for Proposals, which is anticipated for release on or about 24 July 2006.

<DESC>DISRUPTIVE MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES (DMT)
SOL: BAA06-34, Full Proposals Due 1600 ET, October 19, 2006

DESCRIPTION
The rate at which asymmetric threats evolve has increased the speed with which new systems and platforms must be produced and increased the need to distribute new technologies (e.g., upgraded body armor) to a larger number of troops.  Ironically, at the same time, increased lethality of our modern weapon systems has resulted in a reduction of the number of large systems required to accomplish missions.  This new environment places a premium on fast and affordable manufacturing processes.  Furthermore, when the cost of manufacturing spare parts is taken into consideration, it becomes clear that new approaches to defense manufacturing are critically needed to guarantee the future success of the military. 

To address this shortfall, this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is focused on disruptive manufacturing technologies that will have a pervasive impact on DoD systems and platforms, both current and future.  Note that while the substitution of higher performing components (for example, ceramics for metals or new semiconductors) is an important area of research, this is NOT the purpose of this BAA.  

A Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) for this program provides further information on Disruptive Manufacturing Technologies (DMT), the submission, evaluation, and funding process, white papers, proposals, teaming information, and other general information. The DMT PIP is available online at http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/DMT.pdf 

Successful proposals to this BAA will be focused on reducing the fabrication time as well as the cost of materials and/or components that are currently used (or currently programmed for use) in existing platforms or would be used if their price was reduced.  Thus, each proposal must have at least one component challenge problem that will culminate in the qualification of the manufacturing approach for existing materials/components where time, price and performance metrics exist for benchmarking.  

It is anticipated that the challenge problem components will be qualified as preferred spares or as part of a spiral upgrade to the system.  This requirement will ensure that all the fabrication and related finishing and nondestructive analysis tools are in place to provide quantitative benchmarks with the conventional manufacturing processes.  That said technologies that are pervasive beyond the specific challenge problem will be considered more favorably.  

TOPICAL AREAS OF INTEREST TO DMT
The following list illustrates some of the possible research areas (these examples are not meant to be all inclusive). Any disruptive research topic that can be justified against the criteria found in this BAA will be acceptable.

 
Raw Materials: 
Approaches for significantly reducing the cost of raw materials especially through a radical change in the process that changes the cost paradigm. 

Tooling:
Approaches for rapidly defining and producing ‘production quality’ tooling or approaches for completely eliminating tooling.  

Part Manufacturing: 
Approaches that reduce the cost of manufacturing, such as technologies for fabrication of composite parts without the need for an autoclave or near-net-shaped metallurgical fabrication of a high value metal such as titanium.  

Precision Assembly:
Approaches that reduced the cost of producing precise finished parts.  For example, improving the weldability of metals such as titanium, or production of alignment jigs and gages.

Manufacturing Equipment: 
Approaches to (1) significantly reduce the cost of capital equipment and therefore the total cost of parts made in small lot sizes, or (2) significantly increasing the uniformity and repeatability of production, thereby enabling a mixed product stream comprising diverse processes, devices, and materials to be efficiency fabricated on high-volume manufacturing equipment.

Of particular interest is manufacturing tools that enable affordable low volume manufacturing of Microsystems Components, including Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS), electronics, and photonics.

Photonics: 
Approaches for significantly reducing the cost of integrating photonics into military systems.  This could include approaches for dramatically reducing the packaging cost of key components, e.g., transceivers that can consume up to 90 percent of the cost of the final component, cabling costs, fiber optic backplanes, integrated PWB/photonic modules.  

Software Producibility: 
Software enabled products that can adapt to new environments, are critical to ensuring critical functionality and long life for complex manufacturing systems.  Methodologies and tools for developing adaptive software are needed.  How can adaptive features be built in at an acceptable cost?  How general can these adaptive features be?   How can one ensure that destructive adaptation be prevented?  

The following list illustrates examples of current DARPA efforts that would qualify under this BAA in order to provide further guidance on what would be considered to be a DARPA Manufacturing Technology program:

The goals of this program will be enhanced by a multi-disciplinary team of companies and technologists.  Expertise may include materials science and engineering, machine design, process modeling, technical cost modeling, structural mechanics, nondestructive analysis as well as application specific expertise.  The team may include technology companies, part fabricators, and tooling companies.  Most importantly, it is critical that each research team identify which team member will serve as the Systems Integrator (SI) and take ultimate responsibility for acceptance and implementation of successful technology.  The SI will be responsible for liaison with the military acquisition command responsible for the purchase and qualification of the class of components to be demonstrated.  Since team composition will ultimately determine the success of this program, a teaming website is provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at http://www.sainc.com/DMTTeaming.

WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS
Before proposers put together a full proposal, it is highly recommended that a white paper be submitted in response to this BAA.  This white paper should clearly state the uniqueness of the disruptive manufacturing idea presented in the context of existing defense manufacturing capabilities.  The white paper should also describe the proposed approach and explain why it is unique.  Further, the proposer should estimate the direct and/or indirect cost savings that would result from a successful project and the extent to which the project would have pervasive impact relative to number of Defense systems impacted.  Key quantifiable milestones expected in the effort should be described.  Also, a brief discussion of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members should be provided.  Finally, an estimate of the program costs and duration (in months) should be included.  White papers should not be longer than 8 pages.  

A website http://www.sainc.com/DMT0634 has been set up to facilitate the submission of white papers.  White paper submissions may also be made by attachment to an e-mail sent to BAA06-34@darpa.mil (Word 97 or higher is recommended).    WHITE PAPERS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 1600 ET, Thursday August 24, 2006.  

FULL PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS
The PIP outlines necessary details for full proposal submission.  Proposals shall consist of two volumes:  Technical and Cost.  Both volumes should be included as a single document when uploaded to the website.   FULL PROPOSALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 1600 ET, Thursday October 19, 2006.  

EVALUATION CRITERIA
Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, listed in order of importance:   

Scientific and Technical Merit of the Proposal
Proposers must demonstrate that the disruptive manufacturing technology that they proposed is innovative and unique, that they have an understanding of critical technical issues and risks related to the success of that technology and that they have a plan for mitigation of those risks.  Successful proposals will also demonstrate a full understanding of the current processes that are to be replaced and provide detailed technical justification of why the proposed technology will indeed improve the process.  Proposers should clearly and quantitatively recommend and justify technical milestones for both Phases I and II that are on the critical path to successful insertion of the technology.  

Value to Defense
Proposers must demonstrate the potential of successful research to radically change the cost structure of the manufacture of a critical material/part/component currently used in a DoD system.  Proposers must also quantitatively justify any claims of pervasive value of this technology to DoD in general.  Proposers must demonstrate they understand the path to insertion of this technology into existing and future DoD systems.  Efforts with shorter timeframes to insertion will be considered to have increased value to Defense.

Capability of the Personnel and Facilities to Perform the Proposed Effort
Proposers must demonstrate that their team has the necessary background and experience to perform this project.  This includes the identification of Systems Integrator and the potential role on the team of the ultimate Service/industry transition partner.  The balance of the technical capabilities of the team must match that required in the program plan.  The relevant experience of key personnel must be sufficient to provide confidence that the proposers can accomplish their objectives.  Proposers must demonstrate that the combined facilities of the team are sufficient to accomplish the objectives of the proposal.

Cost Realism
Costs of the proposal must be reasonable for the technical work described and provide a high value to the Government.  

Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HBCU, and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) BAA06-43 BioFuels; 
CLOSING DATE: One year from the date of publication in www.fbo.gov and www.grants.gov; PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS DUE: 4:00 pm(Arlington VA local time), 19 Sep. 2006.  POC: Dr. Douglas Kirkpatrick, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA06-43@darpa.mil; 
Proposers’ Day: 25 July 2006 (See bottom for more information)
Website: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/BioFuels/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for BioFuels.  

The Defense Department has been directed to explore a wide range of energy alternatives and fuel efficiency efforts in a bid to reduce the military’s reliance on oil to power its aircraft, ground vehicles and non-nuclear ships. DARPA is interested in proposals for research and development efforts to develop a process that efficiently produces a surrogate for petroleum based military jet fuel (JP-8) from oil-rich crops produced by either agriculture or aquaculture (including but not limited to plants, algae, fungi, and bacteria) and which ultimately can be an affordable alternative to petroleum-derived JP-8. Current commercial processes for producing biodiesel yield a fuel that is unsuitable for military applications, which require higher energy density and a wide operating temperature range.  The detailed specification for JP-8 properties may be found at http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/Files/t83133e.pdf.  Proposers should exclude Section 3.1 of MIL-DTL-83133E, which requires “petroleum, tar sands, oil shale, or mixtures thereof” feed stocks.  Subsequent secondary processing of biodiesel is currently inefficient and results in bio-fuel JP-8 being prohibitively expensive. 

The goal of the BioFuels program is to enable an affordable alternative to petroleum-derived JP-8. The primary technical objective of the BioFuels program is to achieve a 60% (or greater) conversion efficiency, by energy content, of crop oil to JP-8 surrogate and elucidate a path to 90% conversion. Proposers are encouraged to consider process paths that minimize the use of external energy sources, which are adaptable to a range or blend of feedstock crop oils, and which produce process by-products that have ancillary manufacturing or industrial value. Current biodiesel alternative fuels are produced by transesterification of triglycerides extracted from agricultural crop oils. This process, while highly efficient, yields a blend of methyl esters (biodiesel) that is 25% lower in energy density than JP-8 and exhibits unacceptable cold-flow features at the lower extreme of the required JP-8 operating regime (-50F). The focus of this program is to develop alternative or additional process technologies to efficiently produce an acceptable JP-8 surrogate fuel. Potential approaches may include thermal, catalytic, or enzymatic technologies or combinations of these. It is anticipated that the key technology developments needed to obtain the program goal will result from a cross-disciplinary approach spanning the fields of process chemistry and engineering, materials engineering, biotechnology, and propulsion system engineering. The key challenges are to develop and optimize process technologies to obtain a maximum conversion of crop oil to fuel.  The resulting product should comply with current aviation fuel specifications and standards including MIL-DTL-83133E (with the exception of Section 3.1).  

While the efficiency of the oil to JP-8 conversion process is the primary objective of this solicitation, the cost and availability of the necessary feedstock materials should also be considered. The development of conversion process technologies compatible with oils from a broad range of crops, potentially including new crop stocks selected specifically for their oil harvest, is preferred. Proposers will be required to provide a production cost model supporting their assertions of affordability.

It has been demonstrated that oil-producing crops (seeds and algae for example) can be genetically modified or selected to have certain desired agronomic characteristics, such as a higher yield of specific triglycerides. Proposers to the BioFuels program are encouraged to consider the use of selected crop oils (or mixtures) including specific cultivars, strains, etc., to maximize the conversion energy efficiency (crop oil to fuel). While the use of existing crop strains or cultivars is allowable and encouraged, efforts in genetic engineering or modification of crops are outside the scope of the BioFuels program and proposals for such efforts will not be considered.  

The program will be an exploratory evaluation of processing crop oils into a JP-8 surrogate biofuel, resulting in a laboratory scale production to be tested at a suitable DOD test facility. The successful proposer is expected to deliver a minimum of 100 liters of JP-8 surrogate biofuel for initial government laboratory qualification. This final deliverable is in addition to any interim materials the proposer provides the government for intermediate test and evaluation purposes. Proposers should clearly identify the schedule and scope of any requested in-progress testing the government is to perform.  

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fbo.gov and www.grants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal at any time up to the BAA closing date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA06-43) on or before 4:00 pm (local Arlington VA time), September 19, 2006.  

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 § 217 and PL 105-261 § 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, and other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiation.  

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are in descending order of importance: (a) Technical Approach; (b) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the BioFuels Program Objectives and the DARPA Mission; (c) Offeror’s Capabilities and Related Experience; (d) Technology Transition Approach; and (e) Cost Reasonableness and Realism. Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

SECURITY:  The Government anticipates proposals submitted under this BAA will be UNCLASSIFIED.  Guidance regarding the marking, packaging, and delivery of classified proposals is provided in the Proposers Information Pamphlet (PIP) associated with this BAA.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal is provided in the Proposers Information Pamphlet (PIP) associated with this BAA.  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA may access these documents at www.fbo.gov and www.grants.gov. 

Proposers’ Day:  DARPA realizes that non-conventional DoD and DARPA performers will be required for successful execution of the BioFuels program.   In an effort to disseminate information about BioFuels expediently, DARPA will be hosting a Proposers’ Day.  Proposers’ Day is currently scheduled to be held in the following location: Adam’s Mark Hotel, Denver Colorado, July 25, 2006.   DARPA views the Proposers’ Day as a venue to not only provide information about the BioFuels Program, but to promote discussion on the topic, address questions from potential proposers, and provided a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.

Potential proposing organizations will be limited to sending a max of four attendees.

Proposers’ Day Registration Information: Please send e-mail to BAA06-43@darpa.mil not later than July 14, 2006 if you plan to attend. In your e-mail, please include your name, company name, phone number, e-mail address, and citizenship. Foreign nationals should complete and return a DARPA Foreign National Visitor Request (DARPA Form 60) not later than July 14, 2006, if they wish to attend the Proposers’ Day. The DARPA Form 60 will be sent to you based on declaration of citizenship.

The Proposers’ Day will be unclassified and open to all potential bidders. The BioFuels program may be subject to U.S. Export Controls (International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) and National Security regulations. All performers must meet the requirements for participation set by those regulations. The Proposers’ Day is voluntary. Attendance is not required to propose to any potential BAA that may be issued on this topic. This information will also be available through the BioFuels website: http://ww.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/Biofuels/index.htm

The financial application provides both financial and operational data in a format that enables USTRANSCOM managers to make more informed financial decisions.  The application solution leverages existing systems, interfaces and infrastructure including the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW).  This allows operational users a better understanding of transportation financial impacts relative to operations.

<SUBJECT>F--Wild Horse Adoption Services in Southern Nevada
<SOLNBR>NAR060093
<RESPDATE>082306
<ARCHDATE>07052007
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for contractor run adoption events within the Southern part of Nevada for a base year plus two one year option periods. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for contractor run adoption events. Wild horses and burros on public lands are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of December 15, 1971 (as amended) by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and United States Forest Service (USFS).  Excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands as resource conditions and other factors warrant.  Once gathered, excess animals are placed in facilities where they are prepared for placement in private maintenance by private citizens within the United States through the Adopt-a-Horse and Burro program.  Generally, a ready adoption market exists for burros; however, adoptions of wild horses have lagged behind in recent years, resulting in a backlog of wild horses available for adoption.  This has also led to escalating costs to feed and care for the animals.  Recent demographic information for the horse industry also indicates the baby boomer generation is approaching middle age (45-65 years of age), leading to increasing demand for horses with some training.  By increasing the number of gentled/trained horses available for adoption, it is expected that the number of successful adoption will increase and the number of wild horses held and the cost to care for these animals will decrease. General Services - The objective of this contract is to procure services in Clark and Lincoln Counties within the State of Nevada to adopt and/or gentle/train between 50-100 (for all contracts combined) wild horses in private homes on a yearly basis.  The contractor shall provide all the necessary facilities, personnel, equipment, supplies and services to accomplish the following: Adopt and/or gentle/train a minimum of one stock trailer load (10 horses) of wild horses, aged 1-4 years of age.  Least resistance training methods will be used (what comes naturally to the horse). The contractor may train these animals to any level desired to enhance their adoptability, but training is not required; Place an order with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for the number, age and sex of horses the contractor wishes to adopt/train.  Horses will be selected by BLM based on the contractor's order and will be primarily common colors (bay, brown, sorrel, black); Contractor is responsible for transporting the animals from the designated BLM facility to his/her location, and for keeping, feeding, and providing humane care for the animals while they are at the contractor's facility (including trimming feet, providing veterinary care, boostering vaccinations and maintaining current Coggins testing as necessary).  BLM will reimburse the contractor for necessary veterinarian expenses in accordance with paragraph C.6.D; Solicit adopters, market the animals and adopt them to qualified individuals.  Included is explaining BLM adoption requirements to potential adopters and helping them complete the required paperwork.  The contractor will work with the COR to obtain approval of applications and PMACAs for qualified adopters.  This may be done by FAX; The contractor agrees to mentor successful adopters for one year to assure a high percentage of the animals are successfully titled to the adopter(s) of record at the end of one year.  Additionally, the contractor will systematically collect feedback from potential adopters in order to determine degree of customer satisfaction and provide customer feedback results to BLM. This is not a complete list of the specifications, but a general overview to help prospective offerors decide whether or not to download a copy of solicitation NAR060093, which will be available on or about July 19, 2006. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided.  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Agilent Technologies, Inc. for a digital Bit Error Rate (ratio) Tester (BERT).  The BERT will be used for research in optical and electrical digital waveform metrology, eye pattern measurement, and system jitter metrology.  The work is targeted at state of the art communications at data rates of 10 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s.  The research requires repetitive measurement of pseudorandom or user defined bit sequences and requires that the pattern generator have the capability of changing the relative delay between the trigger pulse and the pattern through software, external analog modulation, and through a jittered external clock.  The external delay modulation shall have at least 1 GHz bandwidth and be capable of 100 ps or more modulation.  The electrical pattern generator of the BERT must be suitable for generating non-return to zero (NRZ) data patterns at data rates from 0.62 Gb/s up to at least 12 Gb/s.  The system shall be compatible with 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 6.4 Gb/s PCI-express, and OC-48 and OC-192 standards.  Be capable of adjustable pulse amplitude up to 2 volts and have pulse transition duration (20% to 80%) less than 20 ps.  Have pattern timing jitter less than 9 ps peak to peak and be capable of generating pseudorandom bit sequences (PRBS) of length 2n-1, (n equals 7, 9, 10 and 31) with variable marker density and extended ones or zeros.  It must be capable of generating user defined pulse sequences, capable of generating trigger signals synchronized with the PRBS sequence, and capable of generating trigger signals at the data rate or fractions of data rate (1/8, 1/16, 1/32).  It must also be capable of generating manually programmed data sequences and triggering on specific (less than or equal to 16 bits long) sections of the sequence.  The BERT shall include a synthesized system clock.  The system shall be capable of automatically changing delay between trigger and data by 300 ns or more and include an interface with the computer/network controller for running automated test sequences, controlling relative trigger/data timing, and loading manually generated data sequences. The interface/control software must have a graphical user interface.  The interface/control software must control both the generator and analyzer. The software must be capable of eye contour measurement and “bath tub” plots of timing and amplitude margin.  A cost effective modular design for future addition of additional pattern generators and error detectors and low cost upgrades to bit rates up to 100 Gb/s is also required.    This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  The Agilent system N4873A-ATO is the only system that meets all of NIST’s requirements. This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Rima (e-mail preferred). Anticipated award date is July 21, 2006.

<DESC>The goal of the Transparent Urban Structures (TUS) Program is to improve the collection, understanding, and dissemination of intelligence for the urban conflict.  The key focus of this program is to develop advanced technologies that make urban man-made structures transparent, thereby eliminating the safe harbor that buildings provide to hostile forces and their malicious activities.  This capability will be provided through basic phenomenological research, hardware and algorithm development of sense-through-wall technology that can directly support tactical expeditionary urban operations in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  Sense-through-wall systems resulting from this research will be integrated into emerging net-centric Navy and Marine Corps Command & Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2 and ISR) acquisition programs through a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) .  

The program is structured around the following thrust areas:     

1.)  Developing sense-through-wall technologies which enable behavior/activity classification by determining intent of personnel within structures.

2.)  Developing sense-through-wall technologies which enable standoff detection of weapons and/or explosives caches within structures.  Any relevant technology will be considered, for example: RF, gamma-ray, x-ray, neutron, acoustic and terahertz.

3.)  Creating three-dimensional image and mapping capabilities of man-made structures that update in real time.

4.)  Providing decision aids by fusing sense-through-wall content of suspect structures.

5.)  Optimizing sensor planning and facility/behavior/activity classification by augmenting and exploiting contexts from all intelligence sources.

White Papers are encouraged prior to submitting a full proposal.  White papers will be evaluated to determine whether an offeror is encouraged to make an oral presentation of its white paper to a panel of Government evaluators.  An offeror may submit a full proposal without submitting a white paper or making an oral presentation.

Approximately $10M is available in FY07.   ONR plans to issue an annual BAA for this program.  The total funding for the program is anticipated to be $33M during FY07-FY11.

Attached:  Scope of Work:  Fulfillment House for NPS Fundamentals Training Program Program Description "National Park Service Fundamentals" is a five-part course of study that encompasses a broad understanding of the mission and goals of the National Park Service (hereafter "NPS").  A contractor is required to manage the assembly, storage and distribution of training materials related to this training program (hereafter "Fundamentals").  The primary need is the assembly, storage, and distribution of approximately 14 notebooks.  Note that this contract shall be awarded for a base period and three (3) option periods.  The NPS Training Manager for Universal Competencies provides program oversight.  The NPS Fundamentals Program Assistant, stationed at Albright Training Center, Grand Canyon, Arizona, is the Contractor's principal contact (Contractor Officer Representative - identified by appointment letter).  Contractor should note that NPS Fundamentals is an evolving program.  The following description is based on current operations.  Circumstances may require reasonable accommodation of emerging program needs.  An example of an accommodation is handling fluctuations in the numbers of mailing to individual employees, either fewer or greater than the number provided below, which are based on averages.  Materials Two notebooks are used in the program, one for NPS Fundamentals I-II, and one for NPS Fundamentals III-V.  The notebooks ideally are shipped directly to employees at any or all of the approximately 400 National Park Service units and offices in the United States.  Occasionally, a shipment of notebooks for a group of approximately 30 employees must be shipped as a whole to a specific training location.  Materials currently used in the NPS Fundamentals training program consist of individual items that the Contractor shall assemble into sets or kits as follows:  Item #1 "	NPS Fundamentals I-II binder (12" x 11 ¾" x 2 ½"-3 ½"). "	Cardboard NPS Fundamentals shipping carton (13 1/8" x 12 1/8" x 3 ¾") "	Tabs for NPS Fundamentals I:  9 tabs total, hole-punched, to be put on the binder posts. "	8 ½" x 11" plastic CD-Rom sleeve, hole-punched, to be put on the binder posts. "	CD-Rom to be inserted into the sleeve (above).  "	Letter from the Chief of Training (single 8 ½" x 1" sheet), to be laid on top of the tabs.  Item #2 "	24 tabs for NPS Fundamentals II (approximately 5/16" thick) Item #3 "	NPS Fundamentals III-V binder (12" x 11 ¾" x 2 1/2"-3 ½").   "	Cardboard NPS Fundamentals shipping carton (13 1/8" x 12 1/8" x 3 ¾") "	Tabs for NPS Fundamentals III:  9 tabs hole-punched, to be put on the binder posts.  "	Tabs for NPS Fundamentals IV:  9 tabs, hole-punched, to be put on the binder posts (approximate thickness of NPS Fundamentals III & IV tabs together is 5/16" per package.)  Item #4 "	24 tabs for NPS Fundamentals V (approximately 5/16" thick) "	"Course Objective Text Sets" V Tasks The following services are required:  1)	Transfer of existing materials from Nashville, Tennessee into Contractor's facility.  Transfer of materials shall be completed no later than October 30, 2006.  2)	Begin distribution of notebooks/materials immediately upon receipt (no later than November 6, 2006.  3)	Changes to the curriculum are ongoing.  The Contractor may receive new materials from a wide variety of Contractors.  The Contractor is responsible for:  removal of outdated materials from notebooks that may have been assembled but not yet shipped; re-cycling of outdated materials; providing for the smooth transition from old to new materials; and, continuity of service during the transition.  Contractor shall begin distribution of new materials within one week of receipt.  Note: These occasions rarely happen.  4)	The Contractor shall propose a process for the distribution of all materials as described above.  The current process is outlined in the charts included at the end of this scope of work.  Contractor should validate this process or recommend changes to it, and provide a visual flowchart illustrating the proposed changes.  Once approved, changes in the process shall be approved in advance by the Contractor Officer Representative (COR).  There may be several times during the year when a special course is offered requiring a different shipping process.  Arrangements for these special courses shall be negotiated on a case by case basis, but costs should be commensurate with costs for the normal (i.e., new employee shipments).  5)	Occasionally, items may be misdirected, or fewer numbers will be needed than anticipated.  In either case, the NPS shall be entitled to return the items to the fulfillment house for storage and re-issuance, as needed.  Additional Requirements "	The Contractor shall create and maintain a secure website allowing the NPS to place online orders and access current inventory.  The website should reflect realtime values of inventory. "	The ordering process should automatically access USPS and provide unique tracking numbers to each package, print packing lists, and automatically email NPS Fundamentals staff of the shipping date and tracking number.   "	All materials shall be stored in a secure, dry environment protected from rodents, dust, and other elements of deterioration.  The storage facility shall be available for unannounced inspection by NPS staff at least twice annually.  "	Contractor shall provide at least two contact names who will be available to NPS staff.  Factors to Consider "	Approximately 1400-2000 new employees enroll in the NPS Fundamentals program each year.  Training materials shall be delivered on time to individuals and to training locations.  Accountability is paramount.  "	Item#1 and Item#3 are shipped to individual NPS employees.  These employees are stationed at approximately 400 parks and offices administered by the NPS.  Proposals should provide a minimum and maximum cost for shipping, and/or an average cost by which to calculate shipping these items for the year.  Only actual costs shall be reimbursed and shall be documented in writing in each invoice.   "	The NPS shall provide an Microsoft Excel spreadsheet listing individual employees scheduled to receive Item #1 and Item #3, including street addresses and phone numbers.  "	Shipping information for group or bulk shipments (e.g., 30 set of Item #2 to a specific training location) may require last-minute shipping but in general, the NPS shall provide shipping addresses at least two weeks in advance.  "	The majority of group/bulk shipments (at least 54 shipments) of Item #2 and Item #4 shall be to two shipping addresses only:  Albright Training Center, Grand Canyon, Arizona, 86023 and Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, 25425. "	Invoices may be submitted monthly, but not less than quarterly, beginning November 1, 2006.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Secretary of Tenders Committee, National Electric Power Company, Zahran Street, Al Swayfiyeh, P.O. Box 2310, Amman, Jordan 11181, Phone:  +(962) 6- 5858615 Ext. 6452; Fax:  +(962) 6- 5818336 or 5856421       Jordan Reactive Power Compensation and Transmission Loss Reduction Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a Feasibility Study on the Reactive Power Compensation and Transmission Loss Reduction project.

The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a small, largely land-locked country that is notably resource-poor.  Over the past ten years the country’s electricity production has steadily increased to meet growing power demands; these high growth rates are expected to continue for the next 10 to 15 years.  In response to this growth, and in accordance with the Government of Jordan’s program of economic reconstruction and development, the country’s energy sector has been undergoing significant development.   As a part of its broad reform policy, the Government of Jordan has made a number of decisions in the energy sector aimed at encouraging competition and private sector participation, particularly in the generation and distribution of electricity.  

The existing Jordanian national electrical network is composed of main substations, which are dispersed across the Kingdom to ensure the supply of electrical energy to all consumers.  Jordan is moving toward a pool model for the electricity market and the country is considered a main crossing point for a number of electrical interconnections in the future, including: the electrical Interconnection project of the Mediterranean countries (MEDRING); the project of the Pan Arab Electrical Interconnection; and the Regional Interconnection project (EIJP).  Therefore, a plan to optimize reactive power compensation and transmission loss reduction is considered essential to reinforce the Jordanian electrical network and permit it to participate in the above-mentioned interconnection projects.     

Preliminary technical studies on the Jordanian national electrical network demonstrated that it would benefit significantly from the optimization of reactive power compensation and a reduction in transmission loss.  The Project would strengthen the infrastructure of the current interconnection, and build trade capacity, which will allow for the establishment of a large electrical market for exchange and trading of electricity between the countries in the North Africa/Middle East region.  Jordan would also benefit from the electricity wheeling charges from the transfer of electrical energy among the interconnected countries.  Since Jordan occupies a strategic location between east and west, improving reactive power compensation and minimizing transmission loss will facilitate such power exchange. 

The Project would help the Government of Jordan establish independent energy resources, which is one of the government’s highest priorities for FY 2006.  The Reactive Power Compensation and Transmission Loss Reduction Project would promote this objective by decreasing transmission loss in the country’s power distribution lines.  This would reduce fuel consumption and greatly help Jordan expand its power systems and increase the efficiency of transmission operations.  Implementation of this Project would also enhance the role of the Jordanian network, which is a main crossing point for many electrical interconnection projects in the Middle East.  Additionally, optimization of reactive power compensation would further increase transmission capability, improve the quality of the power supply, and improve the reliability indices.

 
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $158,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Banco del Ahorro Nacional y Servicios Financieros, Sociedad Nacional de Crédito,
 Institución de Banca de Desarrollo (BANSEFI), Attn: David Estefan G., Eje 10 Sur 
Río Magdalena, No. 115, 1er Piso, Colonia Tizapán, San Ángel, C.P. 01090, México, D.F.,
 Phone: 011-52-55-5481-3434; Fax:	011-52-55-5481-3449
The Grantee, Banco del Ahorro Nacional y Servicios Financieros, Sociedad Nacional de Crédito, Institución de Banca de Desarrollo (BANSEFI), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for the Financial Literacy Education Project in Mexico.  

U.S. remittances to Mexico for 2005 are estimated to have reached $20 billion, an amount exceeding all foreign direct investment and development assistance to Mexico and second only to the income of PEMEX from oil exports. Although remittances could significantly impact Mexico’s economic development, limited financial education and trust in the banking sector among recipients, primarily in rural areas, has largely contributed to infrequent use of formal financial services and impeded the potential for leveraging the development impact of remittances.  Less than thirty percent of the Mexican population is estimated to be using bank accounts or other basic financial services.  

Mexico’s Ministry of Finance, Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público highlighted the need for financial education in Mexico during U.S. – Mexico bi-lateral Partnership for Prosperity (P4P) meetings in 2005. Mexico’s National Savings Bank, Banco del Ahorro Nacional y Servicios Financieros, Sociedad Nacional de Crédito, Institución de Banca de Desarrollo (BANSEFI) has taken the lead on this Project.

The objective of this Project is to increase Mexico’s capital mobilization through increased savings rates among low-income Mexican population. A secondary goal is to ensure that Mexican financial institutions are fully aware of the profitable market that remittance recipients represent if appropriately tailored products are properly marketed to them. This Project demands a team of high level financial experts coupled with video technicians that will be able to produce a digital recording of this professional financial literacy training module for application by the Mexican banking sector. This Project is intended to provide training for educators that will educate these Mexicans on the financial products and services that are currently available from financial institutions operating in Mexico, while simultaneously instilling a level of trust that encourages the recipients of remittances to maximize their value by utilizing the formal banking sector.   

The Terms of Reference (TOR) include the following: (1) Develop Financial Literacy Education Training Module (2) Conduct Financial Literacy Education Training and Media Recording (3) Assessment of Results of Financial Literacy Education Training Modules (4) Prepare and Conduct a Seminar for Mexican Financial Institutions on Financial Literacy Education Training Module and Market Potential of Low-income Families (5) Development Impact of the Financial Literacy Education Project (6) Prepare Final Report on Financial Literacy Education Training Program.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $697,550 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT CONTRACT FOR
THE USAID OFFICE OF FOOD FOR PEACE


A.	BACKGROUND

The Office of Food for Peace (FFP) of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA), provides administrative, technical and financial oversight for the Public Law 480 (P.L. 480) Title II program. Title II represents the largest amount of United States Government (USG) resources committed to global food insecurity, providing over $7 billion of assistance since 2001. FFP makes available Title II resources to private voluntary organizations (PVOs), international organizations (IO), primarily the World Food Program (WFP), and foreign governments to address food insecurity resulting from short term emergencies and longer term development problems in food deficit countries. 

Title II programs operate in an environment characterized by increased frequency and severity of natural and manmade disasters; the heightened diplomatic, military and humanitarian demands on the U.S., including the war on terrorism; and the destabilizing potential of HIV/AIDS, conflict, and increased numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons. 

Under the new FFP Strategy Plan for 2006-2010 (www.usaid.gov/hum_response/ffp), FFP has expanded its basic food security conceptual framework to make explicit the risks (economic, social, health and political risks as well as natural shocks) that impede progress toward improvements in food availability, access and utilization.  

Efforts to improve the measurement of Title II impact will continue under the new strategy.

<CONTACT>Deborah Carey, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-875-4229, Fax 703-875-6085, Email careyda@state.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of State has a requirement for seeking the services of a vendor to provide compensation data that will assist the Office of Overseas Employment within the Human Resources Bureau in formulating pay and benefit plans to employees known traditionally as foreign service national, FSN, employees and locally employed LE, staff.  The local compensation plans cover over 40,000 staff members among a wide variety of U.S. federal agencies present in a country.  The Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires each local compensation plan be based on prevailing wage rates and compensation practices for corresponding types of positions in the locality of employment.  The local compensation plans form the basis for all compensation payments to FSN and LE staff.

Therefore, it is the intent of the U.S. Department of State to select one or more vendors who have an adequate proprietary total compensation database from one or more non-US countries that will provide the Office of Overseas Employment the basis for recommending and making revisions to local compensation plans consistent with the departmental regulations, Foreign Affairs Manual and Foreign Service National Compensation Handbook.

The selected vendors (one small business set aside) will provide advice upon compensation issues relating to specific market conditions.  Of particular importance will be expertise in assessing labor markets where volatile economic and social conditions exist related to hyperinflation, currency instability and warfare.  A capacity to develop local market based total compensation information relevant to the given situation is required.  The vendors shall also provide up to date compensation data (pay and benefits) in published reports published on a periodic basis from up to 173 or more non U.S. countries for actual benchmark survey jobs in qualified survey companies.  The timing of individual country reports should coincide with or shortly follow general salary adjustments made by public and private enterprises in the country.

It is anticipated that more than one award will be to the responsible offerors, one award will be made as a small business set aside.  The contract periods will be for one base year and four one year options.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS PLEASE.  The solicitation will be posted here in FEDBIZOPPS on or around July 20, 2006.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State has created a retirement package of recognition gifts for retiring employees from the Department.  This retirement package of recognition gifts would be for approximately 600 employees consisting of departing Civil Service and Foreign Service employees annually.  The retirement package consists of a crystal block sculpture, sculpture base, packaging for sculpture, engraving on the sculpture, U.S. Flag display case, U.S. Flag and certificate holder.

The prospective vendor must acquire, warehouse, assemble, personalize and deliver the retirement package, including the boxed engraved sculpture, flag, flag case, flag certificate and the leatherette bound retirement certificate.

Therefore, it is anticipated this procurement will be conducted in two phases.  For the first phase the vendor will be required to submit their sample crystal block sculpture of the expanding universe and their technical proposal.  The vendors that are most likely to be selected for award will then submit their cost proposal for phase two of this procurement.  It is anticipated award will be made to the vendor that provides the best value to the government which will be based on the factors specified in the solicitation.

The solicitation will be posted here in FEDBIZOPPS for interested vendors on or about July 20, 2006.  No telephone calls please.  Please note this requirement is reserved as a small business set aside.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command intend to procure Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the Apache (AH-64D) D Unique components.  The nature of this contractual action will be a modification to an existing sole source long-term Partnership  Contract with McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company (MDHC) which has three unexercised option years remaining.  This contract provides for up to a thirty four (34) month period of performance.  The PBL program shall be implemented in two distinct phases; P hase I, Transition; Phase II, Full PBL Implementation.  This is a fully integrated effort.  Apache AH-64D Airframe Unique components are those components that are either manufactured or procured by the Contractor, which are found only on the AH-64D Longbow  Apache helicopter.  Except for Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), the PBL program contractor will be required to provide all other equipment, material, labor, facilities, technical support and screening, performance tracking of hardware and software, t o include technical publications and Integrated Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs), and other logistical support resources and engineering services deemed necessary to support and sustain Apache Longbow Airframe D Unique Components.  The specific PBL sup port services required of the PBL contractor will include depot-level component repair for highly complex items, below depot level repair support, system component support, unique consumable items supply, test equipment support, and the necessary supply / retrograde transportation infrastructure up to and including delivery of serviceable components to USG specified combat unit Supply Support Activities (SSA).  This procurement is sole source to McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company, doing business as McDonn ell Douglas Helicopter Systems (MDHC), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code 8V613, 5000 East McDowell Road, Mesa, AZ 85205.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.  2304(c)(1), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, entitled Only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Only Boeing possesses the required maturity in the pertinent tech nologies and associated disciplines to perform this requirement.  Additionally, the product support data required is not readily available to allow another source to perform on the program.  Developing a second source would cause prohibitively significant delays and/or failures due to the enormous learning process involved and lack of technical support expertise available.  As the current sole responsible source for product configuration management, MDHC is the only source possessing the knowledge of the mo st recent capabilities, interface requirements with the Apache Longbow weapon system.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Offerors are encouraged to contact The Boeing Company, for subcontracting opport unities on this effort.  This requirement is currently unfunded; award will be withheld pending receipt of sufficient funds.  No telephone or e-mail requests will be accepted.  Request will be by datafax or mail only.  You may datafax your request to, ATTN : AMSAM-AC-AL-D, William D. Greene, Contracting Specialist at (256) 313-8194.  Request for Proposal will be posted to the AMCOM public Website on or about July 15, 2006 at https://wwwproc.redstone.army.mil/acquisition/ See Numbered Note(s): 22,26.

<SOLNBR>W91QUZ06DZ0XXX
<RESPDATE>081806
<ARCHDATE>10172006
<CONTACT>Neal Dedicatoria, 703-325-3310
<DESC>1.0	SUBJECT This is a Request for Information (RFI) for methods to provide backup power and environmental controls to support Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).  Responses to this RFI are due by 4:00 PM on August 18, 2006.  See section 8.0 for further information. 2.0	INTRODUCTION The United States Army is implementing VoIP at camps, posts, and stations in both the continental United States (CONUS) and outside the continental United States (OCONUS).  Operational requirements and user expectations are that the VoIP system(s) will con tinue to operate in the event of a power failure.  This means the VoIP system must be carefully designed and deployed, providing appropriate monitoring, power conditioning, and environmental controls (cooling and ventilation).  This RFI seeks information r egarding design approaches and technical solutions for addressing the conditions above. 3.0	REQUIREMENTS There are two basic requirements that should be considered 3.1  Reliability. Requirements for reliability and power backup are specified in DISA Generic Switching Center Requirements (GSCR), Appendix 3, (contact Arthur Olson or Neal Dedicatoria, via email at arthur.olson@us.army.mil or neal.dedicatoria@itec4.army. mil for Appendix 3).  It states in part, The components that comprise the [Command and Control Voice Grade Local Area Network] systems for [Command and Control] users shall meet the appropriate GSCR switch type backup power requirements (e.g., 8 hours for  Multifunction Switch (MFS), Small End Office (SMEO), or End Office (EO) for all devices including the phones. For a PBXl, the backup power requirement is 2 hours.  Accordingly, it is expected that if there is a power failure, an entire VoIP system will c ontinue to function for 8 hours if the telephone switch type is a MFS, SMEO or EO.  For a Private Branch Exchange (PBX1), the requirement is 2 hours.  This requirement also assumes that Internet Protocol (IP) telephones will be getting their power from net work devices. 3.2 Environmental controls.  The requirement for environmental controls, cooling and ventilation is to ensure that VOIP services remain operational within the parameters specified in Appendix 3, GSCR . The preferred approach would be the applications of te chnologies and design approaches that would minimize the addition of air-conditioning equipment or structural building changes. 4.0	APPLICATION In a typical camp/post/station, the legacy telephony system has high availability that is provided by built-in battery backup and power generators that are located at the dial central office (DCO) and Area Distribution Nodes (ADN).  Bundles of copper wire is distributed from the main distribution frame to intermediate distribution frames or punch-down blocks within the legacy telecommunications rooms at user occupied buildings. Service is extended from the legacy telecommunication room to the user telephone  instruments.  Since the telephone instruments obtain their power from the dial central office or ADNs, separate power backup is not required at the legacy telecommunications rooms at user occupied buildings.   For VoIP the situation is different.  The VoIP telephones within user occupied buildings, are powered either by the data lines or by the wall outlets. In-line power does not require power at the desktop as the VoIP telephone draws power from the data switc h, which is the preferred approach. If the VoIP telephone is powered by the wall outlet then power backup is still required. At the dial central office and ADNs the data switches, VoIP servers and gateways are typically protected by modular, redundant battery backup with an internal bypass that is connected to power generator equipment and adequate cooling and ventilation. However, at the user building locations the telecommunication room(s) typically are connection points to telephones and computer workstations, and house passive cross-connect points, patch panels, and punch-down  blocks for copper and fiber cable.  The rooms usually provide little to no cooling and airflow features or battery backup services.  The telecommunication room usually contains 1 to 3 racks of equipment and can draw 500 watts to 4000 watts of single-phase AC power. The AC power, 110-60 Hz, 220-50 Hz is country and location dependent. The configurations typically contain either a single room with a single Layer 2 data switch (figure 1), or multiple rooms with multiple data switches (figure 2). The main communications room entrance to the multiple room configurations is typically a Layer 3 data switch with subordinate rooms containing Laye r 2 data switches tied together via fiber-optic riser cables supporting up to 1000 ports.  The user-occupied building generic categories are: "	small (48-144 users): 2ea 16amp/220 volt power supplies "	medium (145-336 users): 2ea 20amp/220 volt power supplies "	large (337-720 users): 2ea 20amp/220 volt power supplies The telecommunications room is normally grounded to the common building ground, and normally has a dedicated electrical circuit(s) from a common user-occupied building electrical distribution panel.  The user-occupied building normally has only one power s ource. Figure 1: Example User-occupied Building with One Telecommunications Room (TR) (Contact Arthur Olson or Neal Dedicatoria via email for Figure) Figure 2: Example User-occupied Building with Multiple Telecommunications Rooms (TRs) (Contact Arthur Olson or Neal Dedicatoria via email for Figure) The data switches are envisioned to provide 802.3af-compliant Power over Ethernet (POE) to the IP phones, and by exception, the IP phones may obtain power from a local power supply brick.  The subject of this RFI is to provide continuous VoIP service to ma intain operation of the data switches and IP phones during a power failure. 5.0	ISSUES AND CONCERNS The challenge in maintaining VoIP operation in user occupied buildings during a power failure is two-fold.  First, adequate backup electrical power must be provided for 2-8 hours, depending on the telephone switch type.  Second, all the VoIP-related electr onics must continue to operate.  This means that adequate environmental conditions must be maintained, either with HVAC or with technology that consumes less power, thus generating less heat while maintaining services. This is complicated by the nature of typical TR environments where the data switches and POE sources are located.  The rooms can be specifically constructed as TRs, but sometimes they are a plywood backboard, an alcove, or an inset.  Moreover, Army camps, posts, and stations may be located in  hostile environments such as deserts or the Artic. This RFI seeks solutions for solving both problems so that VoIP operation will be maintained in user occupied buildings during power failures. 6.0	SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE  Following is a suggested outline with suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are fr ee to develop their response as they see fit.  Section 1  Conceptual Alternatives  Briefly describe one or more alternative architecture concepts for backup power and environmental controls, including the reliability and availability characteristics of the alternatives.  Discuss the differences between Continental United States (CONUS) a nd Outside Continental United states (OCONUS) concepts or solutions, if any.  (2-4 pages per alternative, with one diagram per alternative identifying the brand/type of equipment that would typically be deployed) Section 2  Feasibility Assessment Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements.  (1 page per alternative) Section 3  Cost Estimates Provide a rough order of magnitude cost estima te for each alternative, including non-recurring and annual recurring costs.  Also, discuss cost drivers and cost tradeoffs. (1-2 pages) Section 4  Additional Materials Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate. 7.0	DISCLAIMER  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returne d. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.   8.0	CONTACT INFORMATION  Following is the Point of Contact (POC) for this RFI: Mr. Neal Dedicatoria Contract Specialist (Intern) Army Contracting Agency, ITEC4 Office: 703-325-3344 Neal.dedicatoria@itec4.army.mil Technical Point of Contact Mr. Arthur Olson (732) 532-6114 arthur.olson@us.army.mil Please submit responses via e-mail in Microsoft Office format by 4:00 PM on August 18 , 2006, to the POC at: (email address).

<CONTACT>Steven Bobby, 202-493-4786
<DESC>ABSTRACT: Office Equipment Screening Information Request (SIR) Strategic Sourcing Initiative for the procurement of Office Equipment (Nationwide, Alaska, Hawaii & Territories).  Office Equipment under this procurement will primarily consist of Multifunction Devices, Printers, accessories, and maintenance and lease agreements.  The FAA intends to contract with a commercial office equipment company that is on the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule 36 for multifunctional devices (MFDs) and GSA Schedule 70 for printers. Offerors may submit a proposal for either equipment category (MFDs and Printers) or a combined proposal for both.   Requirements for both Office Equipment segments will include shipping and delivery to over 850 facilities located in the 48 contiguous states (includes the strict of Columbia), Alaska, Hawaii, and various U.S. territories in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Pacific (Guam, American Samoa, and Wake Island). The FAA anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm-fixed pricing per line item for the base year and four (4) one-year options.  Currently the estimated annual total of purchases for both Multifunction devices and printers is approximately $8M. This source selection is conducted in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System. Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal is judged to represent the best value to the Government. The FAA reserves the right to award one contract, multiple contracts, or one contract for MFDs and one contract for printers, whichever is in the best interest of the FAA.  The Government reserves the right not to award a contract, depending on the quality of the proposals submitted and the availability of funds.  All interested sources should first download the Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Proposal (RFP) from this site.  All responses to this SIR/request for offer should be submitted electronically per the instructions in the SIR Section L. To submit your electronic proposal, contact the Contracting Officer (CO), Mr. Stephen Bobby, by email at steven.bobby@faa.gov.  Please provide Company Name, The First and Last Name for the company point of contact, Address, City, State, Zip, Email Address, and Phone Number.   The CO will then email the Offeror a website address  log-on name, and password information.  See Supplier Training Manual Section L Attachment IV. The date and time for receipt of electronic responses is 3:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, June 30, 2006 with signed paper submittal received July 3, 2006.  Any responses submitted after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined unacceptable; therefore, not considered as one of the qualified companies.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary. ABSTRACT: Office Equipment Screening Information Request (SIR) - cont'd. The FAA will accept questions regarding this SIR within five business days of the release of the SIR on the FAA Contract Opportunities website.

<DESC>This synopsis is hereby cancelled. delivery support ACSC requires in creating, marketing, and delivering coursewares. 

1.1.1 Program management support includes planning, programming, staffing, and strict adherence to educational theory and accreditation standards of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), as well as adherence to Joint Staff and Headquarters, United States Air Force educational requirements. It also includes integrating coursewares with a Curriculum Management System (CMS) for worldwide delivery, the establishment of asynchronous, collaborative-learning environments for student-faculty interaction, and the creation, delivery, scoring, and results-posting of student learning assessments. Lastly, program management includes student enrollment, status-tracking, and grade reporting, as well as faculty marketing, recruitment, and training.

1.1.2 Distributed courseware development and delivery includes developing online coursewares, presented via print, streaming video, and interactive learning modules/simulations, to as many as 4,000 students worldwide via a CMS that features asynchronous, collaborative learning. Coursewares will be Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliant and will address the following subject areas:

1.1.2.1 Military History and Strategy

1.1.2.2 National Security Strategy and Decision Making

1.1.2.3 Leadership and Command

1.1.2.4 Joint Force Organization, Planning, and Employment

1.1.2.5 Cultural Awareness

1.1.2.6 Current Operations

1.1.3 Modularity. Each of the courses will be modular – independent of the others, so that each can be modified without requiring modification of the entire program. Additionally, the master’s degree will integrate the existing online Professional Military Education (PME) course that is currently being offered for non-degree development of military officers. 

2. MISSION STATEMENT

2.1  The Mission of ACSC is as follows:  “To our students... Inspire critically thinking Airmen to lead Air & Space forces in Joint/Combined operations. To our faculty and staff... Provide an intellectually stimulating environment that attracts, develops, and rewards the finest team of educator-leaders possible.”

<DESC>Contractor to conduct an evaluation of the current version of the Transportation Financial Management System (TFMS) program release, determine the required changes to meet the stated objectives, and implement those changes.  This action includes completing interfaces, revising the data model, confirming capability to meet the system requirements and documenting all actions.  The effort will include completing the requisite reports for basic financial analysis for all three Transportation Component Commands (TCCs), as well as, USTRANSCOM and the Defense Courier Service (DCS). The completion of this effort will result in a Financial Data Warehouse and reporting capability that meets all stated objectives for the system.  The overall development objective is to build on the successes accomplished during the previous periods with the implementation of USTRANSCOM financial interfaces and related financial applications. The financial application provides both financial and operational data in a format that enables USTRANSCOM managers to make more informed financial decisions.  The application solution leverages existing systems, interfaces and infrastructure including the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW).  This allows operational users a better understanding of transportation financial impacts relative to operations.

The overall development objective is to build on the successes accomplished during the previous periods with the implementation of USTRANSCOM financial interfaces and related financial applications. The financial application provides both financial and operational data in a format that enables USTRANSCOM managers to make more informed financial decisions.  The application solution leverages existing systems, interfaces and infrastructure including the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW).  This allows operational users a better understanding of transportation financial impacts relative to operations.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   Amendment #1 NOTE:  This requirement can result in the award of multiple purchase orders to obtain the data required in the Statement of Work. Technical Questions Question #1:  It is unclear from the Statement of Work whether the EPA's intent for this requirement is  asking for a contractor to submit explicit data reports for fuel/fuel additive toxicology studies already completed, or identify one facility that will provide a single detailed report from possibly several studies conducted in various laboratories.  In the latter case, it would be assumed that the  raw data might be sent to the lab for report preparation.  Could this be clarified?   Answer:  The EPA's intent with this requirement was to leave open the possibility that the Government might purchase data from more than one contractor (see note above).  One contractor would not provide their  data to another contractor. Question #2:  The statement "successful offerors shall retain possession of their data and the right to publish reports referring to such data" suggests that multiple contractors could submit  detailed reports to the EPA?  Answer:  See note and answer #1. Question #3:   However, the descriptions of Task 2, subtasks 1-7 suggest data is being acquired, if not from internal sources, then outside sources, for evaluation?  Answer:  Task 2 refers to the contractor's own study and the data derived from the study.  Subtask 5 may be confusing because it should have the  verb "describe" inserted after "shall".   As the Statement of Work indicates, the EPA does not intend to purchase information "that has already been fully reported in accessible publications."  However, the EPA is looking for unpublished ancillary information from or about a previously reported  study.  The EPA is especially interested in data from studies that have not been published even in partial form.  The EPA does NOT intend to have sources submit their data to another contractor or to have one contractor obtain data from other sources.  However, we reserve the right to use a "third  party" contractor to conduct analyses of data that we have procured through this process.   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00164.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-09.   A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.   The NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is  500 employees.   STATEMENT OF WORK Title:   Provide data from toxicological studies of fuels/fuel additives (alcohols and ethers) to be used in EPA health assessments.   Program Office: ORD/NCEA-RTP Period of Performance:  12 months from date of award Estimated Hours/Level of Effort:  2,930  hours BACKGROUND: Various alcohols and ethers have been used or considered as fuels and fuel additives (F/FAs) in an attempt to formulate "cleaner" gasoline in an effort to reduce levels of carbon monoxide, ozone, and toxic air pollutants.  Although the purpose of these F/FAs is to reduce air  pollution levels, such chemicals need to be evaluated for their own potential toxicity under certain conditions.  Thus, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is interested in compiling health effects information on F/FAs such as DIPE (di-isopropyl ether), ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl  ether), EtOH (ethanol), MeOH (methanol), MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether), TAME (tertiary amyl methyl ether), and TBA (tert butanol).  Health assessments of some of these chemicals (MTBE, ETBE, EtOH, MeOH) are underway for the U.S. EPA's IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System) program, and  Section 1506 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 further reinforces the need to evaluate such F/FAs.   The number of published toxicological studies of F/FA chemicals varies widely.  For example, ethanol has been investigated extensively whereas DIPE has not.  Even a well-studied substance such as  ethanol may have been investigated primarily by one route (ingestion) whereas other routes (e.g., inhalation) may be more relevant to F/FA use and likely exposure pathways.  Under Section 211(b) of the Clean Air Act, the U.S. EPA has exercised its authority to require manufacturers of several of  the above-named F/FAs to conduct toxicological testing of mixtures of these respective alcohols or ethers with baseline gasoline, using the inhalation route of exposure.  Although the U.S. EPA's authority to require such testing under CAA 211(b) is limited to the inhalation route, other routes,  especially ingestion, are also of importance in attempting to understand the broad environmental and health implications of these F/FAs.  Peer-reviewed, published reports of health studies are preferred for use in U.S. EPA health assessments, but such reports may not provide as much information as  desired or necessary for modeling and other analyses used in health assessments.  For example, data on effects in individual animals may be needed for analytic purposes, but published reports often do not include this level of detail.  Unpublished data may also be used in assessments so long as the  data are available in a manner that can be subjected to peer review in the context of the assessment's preparation.  There is reason to think that researchers and research organizations in the scientific community have detailed data from studies that could be useful for U.S. EPA assessments of  F/FAs.  In some cases, these data may have been the subject of published reports, but in other cases the data may come from studies that have not yet been reported in the published literature.  In the latter instance, studies may be in various stages of completion.   This requirement is not  intended to fund the initiation of new experimental studies, nor is it intended to obtain information that has already been fully reported in accessible publications.  Rather, this requirement seeks to obtain unpublished data from existing studies that have been completed, at a minimum,  experimental exposures and collection of "raw" effects data.  For example, tissues from selected target organs may have been collected from laboratory animals exposed to F/FA chemicals in toxicological experiments.  Under this requirement, pathological evaluations of tissues could be conducted,  along with statistical analyses of the data.  Ancillary data on individual experimental animals, including food and water consumption, body weights, time until death, and similar information, would also be required.  Potential offerors should indicate the nature and extent of data available,  including the specific chemical(s) and route(s) of exposure; the chemical concentrations administered; the number, gender, age and species of animals for each exposed and control group; detailed descriptions of the endpoints examined and/or quantified (e.g., tumor sites, number and classification  of tumors); the statistical analyses completed or planned; the relationship of the data to any previously published report(s) on the same chemical from the laboratory in question; and any other information, including provisions for quality control/assurance, that would help the U.S. EPA determine  the utility of the data for health assessment purposes.   Successful offerors shall retain possession of their data and the right to publish reports referring to such data.  Procurement or consideration of an offeror's data shall not imply an endorsement of the study by the U.S. EPA. Tasks Task  1:   After award of a purchase order, the contractor shall be required to develop a Joint Quality Management/Quality Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP), specifying how the data will be compiled, evaluated, statistically analyzed, reported, and transferred in electronic format.  The QAPP shall  address at a minimum the topics listed in the QA attachment   The QAPP shall be submitted to the US EPA Project Officer for approval within four (4) weeks of receiving award of the purchase order.  The intent of the JQM/QAPP is to ensure that the data, data analysis, and reporting of the results  are of acceptable quality and support reconstruction of the conduct of the study by outside review.   The requirements in QA attachments, "EPA Requirements for Quality Management Plans" (http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/r2-final.pdf) and "EPA Requirements for Quality Assurance Project Plans"  (http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/r5-final.pdf) shall be followed.   Task 2:   The contractor shall prepare a report that includes a detailed description of the experimental methods (including information on the dose regimen for chemical administered, the experimental subjects, the endpoints  measured), QA procedures (see Subtasks 1-8 below), data handling procedures, statistical analyses, and results, along with a narrative description and discussion of the results.  This information is expected to be more detailed than typically provided in journal articles or similar publications of  comparable experimental studies.  The report shall be accompanied by the complete dataset in an acceptable electronic format (e.g., Excel, Lotus 123) as an appendix to the report.  The dataset shall include identifiers for individual animals, their respective experimental condition/group, food  consumption (if available) and body weight data, qualitative and quantitative data on toxicological endpoints measured (e.g., number and type of tumors), time of death, and any other available relevant information.  Subtasks 1-7  1. The contractor shall describe all procedures and methods that  will be used in the data collection effort and how they will be documented.  The contract shall also indicate whether the data collection will be carried out in a certified environment, such as a GLP accredited lab, and under generally accepted, citable protocols, including those dealing with the  humane care of experimental animals. 2. The contractor shall identify how study records (e.g., methods, data, supporting documentation) are maintained (including where and how this documentation and the data record will be provided to the U.S. EPA). 3.  The contractor shall provide application of  the statistical method, including: a) method executions and any applicable analysis/visualization techniques; (b) anticipated data portability and/or data storage requirements; 4. The contractor shall provide statistical method integrity: (a) verification that the correct version of the method and  correct input/output files are used during method evaluation and analysis of results (b) archiving method results and periodic review of archives for obsolescence. 5. The contractor shall input and output data characteristics and requirements:           (a) sources of original data;            (b)  criteria for data acceptance or rejection for the purpose of the current project;           (c) any modifications to the original data necessitated by the current project;           (d) data input/output;           (e) data format conventions, conversion issues, maintenance, and archiving. 6.  The  contractor shall provide procedures for recording data and supporting information, noting that the intent is to provide a data record that, in conjunction with the methods section, supports an independent review and the ability to reconstruct the conduct of the study as well as to evaluate the  conclusions in the report based on the study data and study record.  7.  The contractor shall include other applicable procedures designed to ensure the quality of the study, the transparency and integrity of the study record, and the ability to reconstruct the study based on the report and  accompanying record that will be provided to the USEPA. Reporting Requirements The contractor shall have up to 11 months from the date of award to prepare and submit a draft report to the USEPA for review and approval.  The draft report shall include the complete dataset as an appendix to the  report.

6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years (extension optional) 
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS, Dushanbe, Tajikistan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)	Background

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR) is a regional USAID Mission with responsibility for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s assistance program for the five Central Asian Republics.  This program is directed at supporting a program of policy reform, humanitarian assistance, economic recovery, democratic and social transition in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Tajikistan poses one of the most difficult development challenges in the region.  This small isolated country was already the poorest of the republics when part of the Soviet Union, but civil war and economic collapse since independence have now reduced over 80% of the population to poverty.  The country has begun to see a political and economic turnaround since peace accords were signed in 1997.  Tajikistan is on the front line of pressing U.S. concerns in the region: narcotics trafficking and terrorism, Islamic extremism, democratic transition, economic reform, and management of region's vast water resources.  USAID assistance to the country was initially focused on urgent humanitarian needs and supporting the peace process.  Under the new assistance strategy for Central Asia, USAID is increasingly supporting the country’s longer-term development needs, while still meeting humanitarian needs.     
USAID/CAR Tajikistan Country Office is responsible for oversight and coordination of approximately $18 million annually assistance portfolio implemented through approximately 35 institutional contractors and international private voluntary organizations (PVOs), and for coordinating on behalf of the U.S. Ambassador a U.S. Department of Agriculture food aid program involving four U.S. PVOs and the United Nation's World Food Programme (WFP).   
     
B)  Basic Function 

Under the overall direction of the USAID/CAR Regional Mission in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the direct supervision of the Tajikistan Country Officer, the incumbent participates in the conceptualization, design and overall management of USAID/CAR’s policy strategy/portfolio for all Mission’s strategic and cross-cutting objectives in Tajikistan.  The incumbent serves as the Development Assistance Specialist and de facto Deputy Director in USAID/CAR/Tajikistan Country Office.  In that position s/he is responsible for assisting in oversight and coordination of approximately $18 million annually assistance portfolio implemented through four institutional contractors and 20 international private voluntary organizations (PVOs).  As a TCO Deputy Director the incumbent participates in supervision of 10 Foreign National Personal Services Contractor (FNPSC) employees.    
	
C)  Scope of Work

The Development Assistance Specialist is the alter ego of the Country Officer and assumes the responsibilities and authority of the Country Officer in his/her absence.  This requires that the incumbent is fully familiar with all programs and activities, the issues and objectives involved, and the implementation partners and local counterparts.  As needed, the Country Officer may delegate specific responsibilities or assignments to the Deputy, on either a short-term or long-term basis.  The Deputy is required to travel frequently within Tajikistan to monitor USAID activities and to travel, as well, to the USAID/CAR Regional Mission office in Almaty, Kazakhstan to consult with Mission management and technical support office staff.

Areas of responsibility for the position of deputy country officer include:

Email or faxed documentation is preferred as mail delivery may be untimely.  To ensure consideration of applications for the intended position, please reference the solicitation number on your application, and as the subject line in any cover letter.  Selection will be made by a Mission committee no later than August 11, 2006.  

USAID/CAR expects to award a personal services contract for an off-shore US Citizen for two-year period from on or about September 17, 2006 to on or about September 16, 2008.  The contract will be signed by August 25, 2006.  On or about September 17, 2006, the incumbent shall proceed to Dushanbe, Tajikistan to commence performance of the duties specified, subject to medical and security clearance.  The duty post for this contract is Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  

10.  Benefits include post differential, housing, and other benefits per USAID regulations.  Basic household furnishings, will be available in quarters to be provided by USAID. 

11.  Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, is located in the extreme west of the country, about a one-hour drive from the border with Uzbekistan. Dushanbe was formed in 1922, when three small settlements of 5,000 people were united.  It became the capital when Tajikistan became an autonomous republic in 1924. The city lies in a sheltered river valley at 2,300 feet above sea level, below the Hissar Mountains. The Varzob and Kofarnihon Rivers flow through Dushanbe. Because of its sheltered location, Dushanbe is often spared the more extreme weather conditions prevalent elsewhere in the region. Winters are similar to those in Washington, DC, with cool, damp weather and occasional snow.  Spring is generally mild and rainy, while Tajik summers are hot and dry, with temperatures in some areas well over 100 °F.  Autumn weather is generally pleasant and dry.  In all seasons, temperatures can vary considerably during the course of the day. 
 
Now a city of 700,000, Dushanbe in its center retains the atmosphere of its original planners in the 1920s — wide, tree-lined streets with mostly low-rise apartment houses and office buildings painted white or pastel colors. Although traffic has begun to pick up with increased availability of gasoline, it is still comparatively light.  Because of the trees, walking or bicycle riding is pleasant much of the year.

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Cesar Fausto, Contract Specialist, Ph:(505) 256-6447, Fx:(505) 248-3206
<DESC>The New Mexico VA Health Care System (NMVAHCS) is searching for sources that can provide the following for the Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Clinical Research Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC):  Purchase of an Atlas Copco Model ZT18© Oil Free Rotary lobe, two stage, air cooled compressor with an integrated IMD© heated compression air desiccant dryer and Silvan© 240 Gallon Receiver Tank. The Atlas Copco Model ZT18© must meet the following specifications to accommodate the needs of the VACSP manufacturing requirements as providing totally oil free air and corrosion free air that meets or exceeds the standards required for pharmaceutical manufacturing.  It is imperative that VACSP meets those standards and can guarantee that the products they manufacture and process have the safety, identity, strength, quality and purity to be in accordance with cGMP (21CFR part 211.65).  The VA Cooperative Studies Program (VACSP) has ever increasing demands for manufacturing capsule and tablet drug forms and the film coating of tablet forms. Additional equipment units have been added to the tablet/capsule bottle filling line. Many of the equipment units use compressed air for their operation. In some instances, the compressed air comes into direct contact with drug product (referred to as critical contact points) and in all instances the compressed air becomes part of the ambient room air. The compressed air must meet pharmaceutical grade air standards and be free of moisture, oil, and particulates.  The footprint of the new system must not exceed 20 square feet.  The entire system (other than the receiver tank) must be enclosed in a single cabinet for maximized compactness, ease of cleaning and maintenance, and quiet operation.  The system must provide totally oil and moisture free pharmaceutical quality compressed air.  Delivered CFM should be no less than 90 and sound level no more than 75dB(A).  Operation noise level must be quiet enough for installation in a work area (i.e. not enclosed in a separate room due to noise level).  The system must be energy efficient using full load/no load operation and provide limited loss of initial compressor pressure throughout the system.  The desiccant dryer system should use the heat generated by the compressor for operation as no additional energy will be required and will allow 100% of air flow through the unit.  The manufacturer should be ISO certified.  The requested system must meet all the VACSP requirements for a new system. Totally oil free and moisture free compressed air is an absolute requirement because of the VACSP drug manufacturing and processing operations.  Our research has found no other such system of such a compact size in a single enclosed system that incorporates a desiccant dryer utilizing the heated air from the compressor for its energy source. Energy use reduction is an ever increasing concern of the government and this system is very energy efficient. Space has become a critical factor due to increasing needs and the requested system is one third the size of the current system.  The system must be delivered no later then August 31, 2006.  Warranty on parts and labor must be five (5) years.  This sources sought does not constitute an order of any kind nor does it guarantee that an order will be generated in the near future.  At this time there is no RFP (solicitation).  This notice is simply to assist us in conducting market research.  If you have any questions please contact Cesar T Fausto by e-mail or fax.  If your company is able to offer this type of product, then please either fax your request or e-mail it fax number 505-248-3206 email:     Cesar.Fausto@csp.research.med.va.gov.  Just let us know that you are an interested party.  No additional information is required.  We will contact you should we take any action on this requirement in the future.  Any interested parities must reply prior to July 10, 2006 at 1400 Mountain Time.

AIR COMMAND AND STAFF COLLEGE’S ONLINE MASTER’S DEGREE
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT FOR DISTRIBUTED LEARNING COURSEWARE DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY

STATEMENT OF NEED

1. OBJECTIVE 

1.1 The objective of this Statement of Need (SON) is to describe, for preliminary planning purposes only, the requirements of the Air Command and Staff College (ACSC) for programmatic support in preparation for the launch of its online master’s degree program slated for January 2008 implementation. This SON captures in general terms the program management and distributed courseware development and delivery support ACSC requires in creating, marketing, and delivering coursewares. 

1.1.1 Program management support includes planning, programming, staffing, and strict adherence to educational theory and accreditation standards of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), as well as adherence to Joint Staff and Headquarters, United States Air Force educational requirements. It also includes integrating coursewares with a Curriculum Management System (CMS) for worldwide delivery, the establishment of asynchronous, collaborative-learning environments for student-faculty interaction, and the creation, delivery, scoring, and results-posting of student learning assessments. Lastly, program management includes student enrollment, status-tracking, and grade reporting, as well as faculty marketing, recruitment, and training.

1.1.2 Distributed courseware development and delivery includes developing online coursewares, presented via print, streaming video, and interactive learning modules/simulations, to as many as 4,000 students worldwide via a CMS that features asynchronous, collaborative learning. Coursewares will be Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliant and will address the following subject areas:

1.1.2.1 Military History and Strategy

1.1.2.2 National Security Strategy and Decision Making

1.1.2.3 Leadership and Command

1.1.2.4 Joint Force Organization, Planning, and Employment

1.1.2.5 Cultural Awareness

1.1.2.6 Current Operations

1.1.3 Modularity. Each of the courses will be modular – independent of the others, so that each can be modified without requiring modification of the entire program. Additionally, the master’s degree will integrate the existing online Professional Military Education (PME) course that is currently being offered for non-degree development of military officers. 

2. MISSION STATEMENT

2.1  The Mission of ACSC is as follows:  “To our students... Inspire critically thinking Airmen to lead Air & Space forces in Joint/Combined operations. To our faculty and staff... Provide an intellectually stimulating environment that attracts, develops, and rewards the finest team of educator-leaders possible.”

<CONTACT>Martha Daugherty 562-626-7368
<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego, Seal Beach Division, is soliciting information for the purpose of identifying potential vendors for fault tolerant microwave equipment meeting the general requirements identified in Attachment 1.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Corona Division, in conjunction with the Southern California Offshore Range (SCORE) presently has a 155Mb/s microwave shot between Naval Air Station (NAS) North Island to San Clemente Island (SCI).   Due to topography the shot has been done in two legs.  The first leg is a 10 mile shot from NAS North Island to Mt Soledad.  At each end there is an Alcatel MDR-4308s hot standby radio connected to an Andrews UHX-8 antenna.  The second leg is a 72 mile shot from Mt. Soledad to SCI.  At each end there is an Alcatel MDR-4308s high power, quad diversity unit connected to a pair of Andrews UHX-12 antennas.  High power/quad diversity is required be!  cause of the long distance and poor propagation characteristics of the over-the-water shot.  SCORE requires more bandwidth between NAS North Island and SCI in order to meet expanding fleet training requirements.  An additional capacity of 155Mb/s is required.  There is no room on the Mt. Soledad tower to add additional dishes.  Also, the Peak tower is not rated to withstand the wind loading of additional large dishes.  A second standalone microwave with its own dishes is not an option.  Sharing waveguide and antennas places stringent frequency and bandwidth requirements on new microwave. There is no solicitation package available; the RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the Government compensate the respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information for the Government. It is requested that information in response to this RFI be submitted NO LATER THAN 02 August 2006 to Ms Marty Daugherty, Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego, Seal Beach Division, 800 Seal Beach Blvd., Bldg 239, Seal Beach, CA 90740 or by e-mail at: martha.daugherty@navy.mil.  Interested parties may provide any information (specifications, brochures, product application papers, etc) on current or emerging products that address the stated objectives to the above address. The in!  formation provided may or may not be used to assist the Government in formulating and refining its approach for addressing its needs.  Responses should also include the following:  (1) name and address of firm; (2) business size, including average annual revenue for past three years and number of employees; (3) ownership, indicating the following applicable business types:  large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), woman-owned, HUBZone, and/or Veteran owned; (4) number of years in business; and (5) company point of contact, including name, title, phone, fax and e-mail address. The primary purpose of this RFI is to gather information on available and emerging Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Non-Developmental equipment that meet the requirements set forth in Attachment 1.  The information provided may or may not be used to assist the Government in formulating and refining its approach for addressing its needs.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION


SAIC-Frederick, Inc., on behalf of the National Cancer Institute’s Mammalian Gene Collection program, is requesting the following information from companies actively offering contract DNA synthesis: 

What would be the effect on the overall costs if two different clones for every cDNA ORF were synthesized, if the pairs of clones differ by a single base of the target?  Specifically, for each assigned ORF, in addition to synthesizing one clone with its naturally occurring stop codon, what is the effect on cost in getting a second version of the construct which has the second base of the stop codon (of the same ORF) substituted with a “C” (converting all three versions of stop codons to serine codons).  Thus for the target gene, there would be two synthetic ORFs, each with and without a stop codon generated.  What is the effect on the cost if 2 to 4 thousand cloned ORF sequences are targeted?  Would the cost be impacted by the size of the construct or its GC content?

The information above is requested in order to prepare an adequate Request For Proposal.   Please email your responses to Jeanne Lewis,  jlewis@ncifcrf.gov not later than 4:00 pm EST Wednesday, July 12.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541611 ($5 million) which have the capability to carry out an investigation of public perceptions regarding limits to health care spending and approaches to allocating resources, using a method that will inform/educate participants as well as eliciting their views.  Potential approaches include but are not limited to deliberative focus groups, deliberative polls, and citizens’ juries.  The firm must be able to identify and secure a relevant population-based sample or groups of laypersons for this project, and it must be able to propose and justify how the method chosen for obtaining public input will advance the development of practical mechanisms for obtaining this type of input for ongoing and future policy decisions.  This project will address the conventional wisdom that the American public is unwilling to consider “rationing” or to admit to the necessity of making choices among competing uses of health care funds, an assumption that is frequently referenced as a basis for justifying policy related to decision making as well as specific choices in health care.  The project will re-examine these assumptions and specifically investigate the willingness and ability of the public to use economic information, including cost-effectiveness analysis, to set priorities and make choices about spending on health care services.  

Sources must have an understanding of and experience in all aspects of running deliberative focus groups or other methods of elicitation that involve informing/educating participants as well as eliciting their views.  They must be able to demonstrate their ability and creativity in identifying participants from diverse backgrounds and geographic locations and in instrument development.  Sources must also document a successful track record of running large projects in a timely and efficient manner.  Staff must include a Project Director who shall have, at a minimum, a Doctoral degree in a health and human services-related specialty and not less than 15 years work experience including at least 5 years focusing on efforts specifically relevant to this project.  Other staff must include mid or senior level professionals with experience in all aspects of survey research, qualitative research methods, and deliberative methodology as relevant to the proposal submitted.  

Interested small businesses should submit their capability statements (no more than 10 pages in length) to Gayle McClelland, Contract Specialist, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Division of Contracts Management, 500 Gaither Rd, Rockville, Maryland 20850, no later than 2:00pm eastern standard time, on October 3, 2005 .  Capability statements should be tailored to this request and identify the source’s capabilities to complete this requirement, including information on key staff experience and education, and a description of corporate experience with similar projects.  Capability statements should be submitted in an original and two (2) copies.

<CONTACT>Wendy Lopez, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3066
<DESC>The US Army, TACOM-Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, Picatinny, NJ anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the production of the Setter to Platform Cable Assembly for the Enhanced Portable Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (EPIAFS).  The RFP will be for one production year with options for an additional four production years, for a total five production years. The EPIAFS Setter to Platform Cable Assembly is part of the EPIAFS system which will be capable of setting the XM982 Excalibur projectiles and all NATO standard inductive fuzes. The EPIAFS system consists of three electronic components: A Platform Integration Kit (PIK), a handheld Setter, and a setter to gun Cable.  The PIK is a gun-mounted data processor that sends and manages the data stream from multiple interfaces. The setter is a handheld device which inductively couples data and power to either the Excalibur projectile or applicable fuzes.  When used alone, the Setter must replicate the functionality of the M1155 PIAFS.  When this Cable Assembly is connected to a Howitzer with an automated fire control system, such as the Light Weight (LW) 155 Towed Howitzer M777A2 or the M109A6 Paladin Digital Fire Control System, the EPIAFS can receive and inductively supply a stream of data, power, and timing pulses to initialize a precision guided GPS projectile such as Excalibur.  Excalibur is a GPS Precision Guided Munition which requires power and Gun, Target, Fuze, and GPS data to be sent over an inductive interface to initialize the projectile. Funds are available for this acquisition.  These Cable Assemblies will be furnished as Government Furnished Material to the EPIAFS systems contractor.  The Request for Proposal which will address a requirement to producethese cable assemblies will be posted on or about July 19, 2006.  Point of contact for this requirement is Wendy M. Lopez, AMSTA-AQ- APC, Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. Email: wlopez@pica.army.mil

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

This document constitutes justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  It is executed on behalf of:  												Agency					Contracting Activity
	USSOCCENT/CCJ6- P			6th Contracting Squadron
	7115 S. Boundary Blvd,			2606 Brown Pelican Ave
	MacDill AFB, FL 33621-5101		MacDill AFB, FL 33621-5000

2.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING PROCESSED:   

The action being processed is for a Sole Source, firm fixed price, delivery order, for SecNet11 (Secure Network) Secure Wireless LAN product, deployable kits (Long Range, Standard and Co-Located kits) and training.  The above mentioned items will be awarded to: Harris Corporation, 2400 Palm Bay Road, Palm Bay, Florida 32905.  Phone (321-727-5055), Fax 321-674-2571.  This is a new requirement and requires FY 06 O & M funding be used.

3.	DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY’S NEEDS:

This contract is for deployable Secure Wireless LAN communications (NSA Approved Type 1).  

4.	AUTHORITY:

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as cited in FAR 6.302-1.  

5.    	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE OR BRAND AUTHORITY:

Currently, Harris Corporation is the sole provider of the SecNet-11 product line as well as the co-located, long range and standard kits.  They are also the only contractor capable of giving the training required to properly use the equipment in the field.  SecNet-11 is the only Type-1 Secure, wireless local area network solution to be endorsed by NSA.  The SecNet-11 product line consists of the SecNet-11: Wireless Network Interface Card, Wireless Bridge and Key Fill Cable.

6.	DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE.

This money was awarded as a C2IP initiative.  C2IP provides the Combatant Commands a capability to implement timely, low-cost, near-term improvements to their command and control systems.  These funds are used to adapt and evolve existing command and control systems to meet unique requirements that arise due to unforeseen situations.  Immediate funding for such requirements result in discernible improvements in the readiness and combat capability of the commands by virtue of the Combatant Commanders’ enhanced ability to command and control their forces.

GSA has already determined the price to be fair and reasonable as per FAR 8.404(a)(i).  
 
8.	DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED.

Market research will not be conducted since Harris Corporation is the only NSA approved source for the Secure Wireless LAN, Type 1 product.  SECNET-11 provides the Commander a unique capability to improve his ability to Command and Control.  This system is a unique requirement and the technical solution designed in house. 

9.	A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESS, IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION.

This does not apply.

10.	A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED.

In the future, market research will be conducted to see if other vendors can carry this item at a competitive market value. 

11.      	TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE CERTIFICATION

I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<SUBJECT>J -- Retrofit of Communication Tower Trailers
<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Mt. Weather Emergency Operations Center (MWEOC), Mt. Weather (Bluemont), VA  intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Teltronic Inc., Beltsville, MD for the purchase of equipment and services to retrofit four communications tower trailers for the Mobile Emergency Response System (MERS) and Land Mobile Radio (LMR) equipment and satellite communications equipment.  The retrofitted travel trailers will be used to provide voice communications in the field for the support of the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) and The Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) program.  FEMA requires retrofit of the Motorola equipment currently located in four trailers to be compatible with the equipment that is already in the NDMS and US&R programs.  FEMA requires that all of the tower trailers be identical in their equipment and configuration so that any unit can operate independently or in conjunction with the other units in the system. Currently there exists limited equipment in each unit and depending on the mission needs each has to be reconfigured or equipment swapped between units to meet the mission profile. FEMA also requires that the existing units all be brought to the same firmware level in order to eliminate the need of having to carry multiple laptops to program the equipment in the different trailers.  It is necessary that the Contractor have certified technicians to work on FEMA’s existing Motorola Government owned equipment and be licensed by Motorola to provide the software upgrade to the existing Motorola equipment.
The Contractor shall overhaul existing Government furnished repeaters which will be aligned, repaired and tested to ensure the equipment meets current factory specifications.  Units must be capable of functioning in the digital and analog modes.  Antennas, duplexers, power supplies and RF PA’s are to be replaced as needed.  The Contractor shall also provide the following equipment:  Telwave wattmeters and carrying cases, IS PolyPhasers, Cellwave antennas and duplexers, Bud equipment racks and black shelves, Motorola power amps and power supply’s.  Interested parties may respond by identifying their capability to provide the required retrofit services and to provide the necessary equipment, to include descriptive literature and capability statement.  Interested parties must also provide proof that they employ certified technicians and are licensed by Motorola to provide the required software upgrades.  Responses shall be sent via email to Sandra.nixon@dhs.gov and must be received no later than 3:00 PM/EST on July 17, 2006.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responses received by the date identified above will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This is not a small business set-aside requirement.  NAICS Code is 811213,  Small Business Size is $6.5 Million.  However, this notice serves as a means to locate any potentially qualified small businesses who could perform the required retrofit services and provide the necessary equipment.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Program Management and Analysis Program (IRM/OPS/PMA).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Cisco switches.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government?s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Cisco 4506 switches have been identified as a key component of the Department of State infrastructure.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the switches must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cisco 4506 Switch as a key component of the Department's networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State?s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department?s requirements as a key component of the Department?s networking system.  The Cisco 4506 Switch has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for GITM deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec) B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C) Seller is providing these products via Cisco authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales. D) Full Cisco warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. To bid on this item, Sellers must be Cisco Gold or Cisco Silver Certified Federal Resellers. No Exceptions.

DOS found a significant &quot;side benefit&quot; of standardizing our printer hardware (in addition to the cost savings noted above) in the money savings we experience in toner cartridge purchasing.  As all of our printers use only  three different print cartridges.  Introducing other models will not allow us to experience the cost savings we currently enjoy for bulk purchasing Print output continuity via redundancy i.e.  our users are able to route their print jobs to any one of several different printers.  AS each printer is configured in the same way (because they are the same make of printer), no changes need to be made to the output selection.  The users are guaranteed to get the same output from each printer (of the same type, of course) A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. *NO COMPATIBLES.  MUST BID NEW ONLY, HP ONLY (NO REFURBISHED, NO LIKE-MFR WILL BE ACCEPTED!)

<DESC>GSA’s Southeast Sunbelt Region announces a contracting opportunity for agency construction management (CMa) services in connection with the design and construction of a proposed twenty-five to thirty million dollar (hard construction cost) project in the Fairlie Poplar Historic District of downtown Atlanta, GA.  The proposed project is an annex to the existing Elbert P. Tuttle United States Court of Appeals Building (Tuttle Building Annex).  The 120,000 gsf project is the adaptive use of two existing historic, five story buildings with basements, new construction of a loading dock and tunnel connection to the existing Tuttle Building for administrative office space for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.  The project is being delivered using the design-build “bridging” methodology.  The "bridging" architect-engineer is Stevens & Wilkinson Stang & Newdow of Atlanta, GA.   A contract for abatement and demolition based on complete construction documents is scheduled for award to an 8(a) certified firm in Sept 2006. This CMa contract is scheduled for award about Oct 2006. The bridging design is scheduled for completion in mid-Jan 2007.  A separate design-build contract based on approx. 35% complete contract (bridging) documents is scheduled for award in May 2007.  The design documents for the project are being produced using Revit v9.0 and Constructware is the ePM collaboration tool.

Scope of Work
CMa services under this contract will generally include design management, construction management, and building commissioning services.  The CMa through a multi-disciplinary team shall assist GSA in performing design reviews using Dr. Checks of the final design intent documents by the Bridging A/E and the production of construction documents by the Design Build contractor’s A/E (Architect of Record).  The CMa shall assist GSA in managing and administering the contracts for construction with the abatement/demolition contractor and with the Design Build contractor for all other work.  The CMa shall perform Building Commissioning services to verify and document that the performance of the facility and its various systems meet the design intent as well as the functional and operational needs of the building owner and the occupants of the building.  There may also be a contract option for the CMa to provide post-construction services consisting of move planning related services for the occupants of the building.  The CMa will be required to staff an office at the job site during the construction phase of the project.

Selection Process
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to firms interested in competing either as prime or as consultant to the prime for the contract for these services.  This is not a request for proposals.  All services shall be performed under the direction and supervision of professional licensed architects and/or engineers.  
All offerors will initially be ranked based on technical qualifications for this particular project and the evaluation criteria listed and described herein.  A shortlist of at least three offerors will be established and the short-listed offerors invited to present their qualifications and submit to interview questions.  GSA will then rank the short-listed offerors in order of technical qualification.  GSA will then enter into fee negotiations with the offeror ranked as the most technically qualified for this project.  Assuming that agreement can be reached on a fair and reasonable fee with the top ranked offeror, GSA will enter into a contract with that offeror.  If agreement cannot be reached on a fair and reasonable fee, GSA will terminate negotiations with the top ranked offeror and enter into negotiations with the second most highly qualified offeror.
The “offeror” as used in this RFQ is a firm, association, joint venture, partnership, or other legal entity which will have contractual responsibility to GSA for the services under the contract.  An Offeror consisting of more than one firm as prime contractor shall clearly describe the form of legal entity and clearly describe the role and responsibilities of each firm.  Joint Ventures must clearly identify their contractual arrangement with each other and the roles and responsibilities of each joint venture entity.     

Offeror’s qualifications will be evaluated based on the criteria listed and described below as derived from information in Offeror’s submittal and for short-listed offerors, from Offeror’s submittal, interview, and references.

The projects submitted shall be the projects by the Offeror which it believes to be most comparable to the project described in this RFQ.  The narrative shall address the offeror’s roles and responsibilities on the projects submitted and how the client’s objectives were satisfied through the services provided by offeror on the submitted projects.  The narrative shall relate the relevance of the projects submitted to the subject project of this RFQ.  The submission should include tangible evidence such as certificates, testimonials, awards, peer recognition, etc. demonstrating client satisfaction and project performance with regard to quality, schedule, cost, and safety.

The narrative shall describe the lead person’s proposed role and responsibilities on this project.
Responses to this RFQ shall include a composite Standard Form (SF) 330, Part I, Contract-Specific Qualifications for the proposed project team and SF-330, Part II - General Qualifications for the prime firm and each proposed consultant.

In support of the agency's efforts, the CM shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the above goals.  The use of subcontracting consultants will be reflected in a Small Business Subcontracting Plan to be submitted with the proposal and included in the contract.  All interested large business firms are reminded that while not required to subcontract any work, the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum extent practical with the small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small, HUBZone small, veteran-owned small business, and service-disabled veteran owned small business firms submitted as part of their original teams.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<SUBJECT>66 -- Upgrade for an existing Coherent 890 laser including a  Verdi V18 (Nd:YV04 laser)

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires an upgrade to an existing Coherent 890 laser.  This Commercial upgrade is required in order to undertake a newly funded competence project.   NIST requires Ti:Sapphire (Ti:S ) optics, Ti:S  pump mirrors, and Ti:S pump power.  As part of the NIST competence program, NIST is developing a very high force optical trap with minimum heating, which requires >3 W of laser power at 800 nm, with any added performance increasing NIST’s utility. To do so, there needs to be as much power out of a Ti:S laser as possible. To get the maximum power out of the existing Ti:S laser, NIST needs the highest possible laser pump power at 532 nm.  Only Coherent makes an 18 W laser, diode pumped, solid state laser at 532 nm. As part of this project, NIST is refurbishing an existing Coherent 890 laser (S/N 93391425).  NIST requires that accompanying this laser installation there be a complete refurbishing of this Ti:S laser, with new optics. Further, the complete system needs to be integrated and the full system shall produce at least 3 watts of laser power at 800 nm.  The stiffness of the resultant optical trap is proportional to the laser intensity. It is a requirement for a high force, yet precise optical trap, with excellent stability in trap stiffness, which requires excellent stability in laser intensity noise.
The new laser shall be an all solid state, diode pumped, frequency doubled Verdi V18 (Nd:YV04) laser (532 nm), proving single mode operations (M2 <1.1). Argon ion lasers are not compatible with the existing infrastructure (Plumbing, space, and electrical power).  Power stability is an important requirement for the end use and power stability of the pump laser and will directly affect the power stability of the Ti:S laser.  The laser intensity noise < 0.03% RMS measured over 10 Hz to 1 GHz.  This large difference affects the experiments ultimate goals of producing as stiff an optical trap as power. Hence, the project requires the 18 W pump laser, and the following items:

<DESC>This amendment is to answer questions regarding the brand name justification. BEP is not accepting equal products for this requirement. The following memorandum describes the reasoning: 

The Chief Information Officer Directorate has made a determination to standardize on state-of-the-art, DELL servers throughout the Bureau, both in the Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX facilities. Standardized DELL network servers provide for standardized motherboards containing standardized drivers that facilitate network management both with regard to initial imaging as well as subsequent network administration/management via the Bureau's Microsoft System Management Server (SMS). The Bureau's previous policy to purchase multi-brand servers did not provide for standardized network management. Additionally, a number of these "low cost" servers did not facilitate provisions for additional memory. When they did, different motherboards were oftentimes required, as were different network cards. 

Standardization not only facilitiates network administration/management, but also provides for enhanced asset management across the enterprise. Dell servers, providing for standardized mother boards across multiple generations of PCs, best meets the Bureau's needs.
