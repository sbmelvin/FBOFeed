<DESC>NASA/Johnson Space Center (JSC) plans to issue a noncompetitive Request for Proposal (RFP) to Lockheed-Martin Space Operations for a one-year extension (9 month basic period, and 3, 1 month options) to the Science, Engineering, Analysis and Test (SEAT) contract (NAS 9-19100), covering the period from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be released during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2002. This extension allows for the continuation of the following engineering and science activities: design, development, fabrication and assembly, and certification of flight hardware; software and ground support equipment; performance of structural, thermal, materials, guidance and navigation, and control system analysis; development and sustaining engineering of real-time engineering and human-in-the-loop simulation systems; performance of research and development in all of the engineering disciplines; performance of earth science research; performance of photo and television analysis. Translation of life science experiments into payloads and integration into space vehicles; provision of crew training an payloads mission management; and maintenance and operations of major engineering test facilities in support of all NASA JSC missions.  In addition the SEAT contractor is responsible for supporting astronaut crews in Earth observing activities including planning training cataloging and analysis.     Authority for the one-year extension comes from a deviation to FAR 17.204(e), NFS 1817.204(e) and NASA Procurement Information Circular 00-22 requirements granted by NASA Headquarters on September 6, 2002.    This extension will promote maximum industry participation by allowing for the completion of current JSC competitions thus freeing necessary resources to support the SEAT recompetition.	In addition, the one-year extension will allow NASA additional time to assess the impacts of ISS Program consolidations activities on SEAT contract requirements.      The Government does not intend to acquire commercial items using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26.  See Note 22.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NA NSN:  8415-01-478-3517;  This solicitation is restricted to ADI Technologies, Incorporated, 1487 Chain Bridge Rd  Suite 204, McLean  VA  22101 as they are the only known contractor who meets the requirements.  In addition, ADI possesses the Technical Data Package (TDP); therefore no government owned TDP is available for the Overvest.  In addition, the risk of producing the Overvest to meet OSHA and federal regulatory guidance is such that a new producer may be unable to adhere.  The aforementioned contracto r is a small business concern.  This proposed action will result in a firm fixed price, three-year requirements type contract with two concurrent 100% options to extend the period of performance.  First Article Testing is required.  The maximum estimated q uantity is 2,700.  FOB is destination.  The overvest is a one-size-fits-all vest and has a slide fastener closure down the length of the back for ease of donning and to allow the Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) cylinder to be changed during a mis sion.  The arm openings and bottom of the overvest are elastic.  The overvest provides splash protection to the SCBA.  The overvest is constructed of Lantor/Remploy LR6.  The panels are sewn together and taped.  The tape is heat sealed on all seams.  This item is part of a chemical resistant Improved Toxicological Agent Protective Suit.  The overvest is made up of an industrial and chemical warfare agent protective material that provides splash protection for the SCBA.  It should allow full range of neck mo tion and should not inhibit full movement of head, neck, and arms.  Overvest is used in Mode Level B.   NOTE 22 APPLIES

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ 08855,  pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This is to be issued under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The procurement is for the following items: 1) #13471401 AKTA Purifier 10 (1 each); 2) #18608300 FRAC 950 Fraction Collector (3 each); 3) #18608313 FRAC 950 Rack C Micotitre Pit (3 each); 4) #13464301 EVO SFF 1.7GHz Unicorn Control (2 each); 5) #13439701 Unicorn 4.0 Upgrade (1 each); and 6) #18114277 Unicorn PCI Control Card (1 each). This system will allow a new high pressure analytical analysis that requires pumps that can operate under high pressure, but that can also be used for other preparative protein purification purposes (0-3625 psi pressure range and 0.01-10 ml/min flow rate range).  This system will be compatible with existing chromatography systems already in use in the laboratory allowing transfer of methods and results files between systems.  This system must have a wetted flow path that it inert to halides.  The controller should allow programs to be time-,volume-, or column volume-based.  The fraction collector should be fully integrated into the system and controllable by the system software.  The system must be specified for use refrigerated at 4 degrees C.  It must include a three-position injection valve for automatic loading of the sample onto the column.  Documentation of each run should be automatic and exhaustive.  A UV detector that monitors simultaneously on at least three wavelengths is required.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 10 days of date of notice to Dee Lunney at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Amersham Biosciences.  The NAICS Code/Size is 334516/500EM.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.*****

<DESC>The Department of Justice, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13, intends to issue separate sole-source Purchase Orders to Wilbert Briggs and Joyce Brewer, both in the Washington, D.C. vicinity, to provide technical support services to recommend/perform an approach to the design, development, testing and implementation of various financial applications on PC/LAN and Mainframe platforms interfacing to FMIS in the Teradata environment. The work consists of maintenance, user support, redesign and enhancement of the Debt Collection Module. It is critical to the Department s efforts to comply with the mandates imposed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 and it s self imposed Five-year Plan, to retain the services of contractors with detailed knowledge of the FMIS, the processes supported by the Debt Collection Management Module, the actual code comprising the modules, the multitude of modules supporting the payment, accounting and management reporting activities which comprise the services provided to the other organizations by the Finance Staff. The cost and the time to develop the requisite technical capabilities within other contractors would result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through full competition. Furthermore, this would delay the completion of the new systems and seriously jeopardize meeting deadlines. Briggs and Brewer are uniquely qualified to perform this service by their years of experience with the FMIS, including specifically the development of the Debt Collection Management Module. Responses received as a result of this notice of intent shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses will not be considered as either proposal or bids. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition, based upon the written responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received at the address above by COB 09/13/2002.

<DESC>THIS ITEM PREVIOUSLY POSTED UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER F08635-03-R-0003.  The Precision Strike System Program Office (SPO), Air Armament Center, Eglin AFB, Florida is issuing a sources sought synopsis in response to the need for an aerial decoy, in relation to the Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) mission.  The Precision Strike SPO plans to contract for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of a low cost, expendable, air launched vehicle that can present the radar signature and operational flight profile characteristics of a fighter/bomber/attack aircraft with sufficient fidelity to stimulate, deceive and decoy threat Integrated Air Defense System (IADS).  The aerial decoy is anticipated to be the first in the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) system family.  Provisions for spiral development of a stand-in jammer to counter early warning, acquisition, and fire control radar systems must be considered.  The short duration, expendable, low cost nature of the vehicle should be considered first in application of existing technology to the various vehicles.  It is desired that the physical appearance of all MALD family vehicles (decoy, jammer, etc.) appear to be identical to the casual observer.  As a threshold, the vehicle will be capable of being carried on and launched from a USAF B-52H bomber and F-16C/D fighter aircraft with objective carriage on the F-15C-E, B-1B, C-130, A/OA-10, B-2, F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).  Any requirement for communication between the host aircraft and the MALD will be design dependent. A cost type contract for SDD is planned for award in the third quarter of FY03, and will be of approximately 60 months duration including 24 months of seamless verification .  The end product will be a low cost, producible, expendable decoy.   The development contract will contain an option for a 150 unit Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase prior to proceeding to a full rate production decision.  The acquisition strategy objective is to use, wherever possible, already developed and mature technologies and components in order to achieve a low cost and timely solution.  The most current MALD documents have been placed in the on line data exchange system - ATIMS for review and will be updated on a continuing basis.  Access to ATIMS is through the website http://atims.hill.af.mil.  A Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP) and subsequently a Request For Proposal (RFP) will be placed on the Government Website www.fedbizopps.gov.  The Program Office anticipates the release of the DRFP approximately 60 days from this announcement.  Interested firms are requested to submit information outlining their capabilities no later than 15 days after publication of this notice to Ms. Karen Schutt, AAC/WMGK, 102 W "D" Ave, Suite 300, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6808 or by email at karen.schutt@eglin.af.mil.  Contractual questions should be addressed to Ms. Karen Schutt, Contract Specialist (850) 882-9514, ext 2243 or Mr. Statia McNeese, Contracting Officer, (850) 882-9514, ext. 2115.

<DESC>This is a draft request for proposal for acquisition of the Visual Information Management System (VIMS) for the Defense Visual Information (DVI) directorate of the American Forces Information Service (AFIS.)  This draft is published with the intention of obtaining comment from interested sources regarding acquisition approach, including the use of a Statement of Objectives (SOO) as a requirements specification document, the line item structure and the use of indefinite quantity line items to satisfy customer demand, as well as the use of the evaluation criteria shown in the draft RFP. The VIMS will help meet DVI modernization objectives by using advanced technologies to ingest, index, store, search, distribute, and manage Visual Information. The system will also supply DVI the ability to capture and automate the storage of motion media, still media, graphics, audio, and documents/text.  The SOO calls for innovative approaches to accomplish these objectives.  The line item structure is designed to promote innovation by allowing potential offerors the ability to configure solutions to various requirements within the generalized line item descriptions.  The indefinite quantity line item descriptions and the estimated annual quantities to be ordered against these line items are still being established at this time.  The overall structure of these line items can be determined by examining appendix 7 to the SOO.

All interested parties are advised that this is only a draft RFP.  It has not been subjected to higher headquarters review, and may change as a result of such reviews.  No offers will be accepted as a result of the publication of this draft RFP.  It is published merely to determine if there are any impediments in the approach taken to obtaining a system that meets the stated objectives.  This approach includes the use of indefinite quantity line items to make versions of the system available to authorized visual information activities according to their needs.  

Comments should be directed to Bill Gilmore at (909) 413-2412, fax (909) 413-2432, e-mail gilmorw@dodmedia.osd.mil.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Prevention Studies Branch (CPSB), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure services from Dr. You-Lin Qiao, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 10021, PR, China, for data entry and analysis of the epidemiology questionnaire to the Shanxi Province Cervical Cancer Screening Study.  The services are being procured in accordance with simplified procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The Cancer Prevention Studies Branch (CPSB) requires data entry and file development of epidemiologic data on cervical cancer in a high-risk population of women aged 35-50 years who have not had prior access to cervical cancer screening services.  The ultimate purpose of this research project is to analyze epidemiologic data in women who have chronic Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) of the oncogenic subtypes in order to test specific dietary and other lifestyle hypotheses related to risk of cervical cancer.  The data file and forthcoming data analyses will be used in the future to identify serum biomarkers and tissue concentrations of food components related to cervical cancer risk with the ultimate goal of conducting a potential cancer prevention trial of phytochemicals or food sources to reduce cervical cancer incidence.  The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has recently completed a survey of women aged 35-50 years in Shanxi Province China, where the age-standardized mortality rate of cervical cancer is the highest in all of China and where cervical cancer screening is non-existent.  An epidemology tool was pretested and piloted for this survey and interviewer-administrated data were collected on 10,000 women.  These women represent all women in the ages specified above who reside in several randomly selected villages in the province.  The tool included questionnaire items about dietary intake, lifestyle and demographic characteristics, reproductive history, family history of cancer, and reproductive disease.  HPV status was assessed by several screening modalities including the direct test, self-test, as well as biopsy and colposcopy, by a team of gynecologists from The Cleveland Clinic.  A woman aged 35-50 years who is diagnosed with HPV oncogenic subtype is by definition suffering from chronic HPV and therefore all positive diagnoses in this population will be analyzed as members of the high-risk group for cervical cancer.  Given the large sample size of 10,000, there is the opportunity to compute individual food-specific associations with risk.  Period of Performance:  upon award of purchase order through 12 months.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) applies to this requirement.  Dr. You-Lin Qiao of The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences is the only source known to the NCI who is the Principal Investigator of this survey.   This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on September  16, 2002.   If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB), Division of Cancer Control and Populations Sciences (DCCPS) plans to enter into a sole source contract with The Miriam Hospital, Centers for Behavioral & Preventive Medicine, Lifespan Academic Medical Center & Brown University, 164 Summit Avenue, Providence, RI 02906 to prepare a database of investigators, interventions, and instruments used in tobacco cessation and reductions programs.  Research for this database will include those studies that utilize pharmaceutical products as the focus or as adjuncts with other interventison for tobacco cessation or reduction.  Tobacco control research is a major focus of the NCI.  There currently is no database of ongoing tobacco control research programs that includes work sponsored by the variety of non-government organizations. (e.g. Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, pharmaceutical industry) as well as government-funded research (NCI, NIDA).  Such a database would help NCI in determining how best to apply its tobacco control resources.  The Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine (CBPM) at Brown Medical School has been a major contributor to tobacco control research over the past two decades.  Within CBPM, The Nicotine and Tobacco Research Center continues to conduct numerous research studies, ranging from investigations of biobehavioral mechanisms and genetics of tobacco addictions to public health intervention and policy evaluations.  The CBPM faculties maintina valuable contacts with other tobacco researchers and communication networks, which will be important to this project.  Judith DePue, Ed.D, MPH, will manage the work of this contract, with ongoing collaboration and oversight by Dr. Niaura.  Dr. DePue has been involved in tobacco resarch for 20 years as a project manager and investigator, as well as Co-Investigator on a NIDA-funded project "Immunizing Youth Against Tobacco Use", NCI funded TTURC, Project 3, "Efficiency of Sustained Cessation for Population" and complete NCI-funded "Helping Parent in the Pediatric ER to Quit Smoking.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Laryngeal and Speech Section (LSS), Motor Control Division (MCD) plans to procure an Articulograph AG200 from Carstens Medizinelektronik GmbH, Nelkenweg 8, D37120, Lenglern, Germany.  The supplies are commercial and are being procured in accordance with simplified procedures authorized in FAR Part 13  The North American Industry Classification System code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees. The proposed purchase, the articulograph AG200, is the only noninvasive device that is suitable for measuring the movement coordination of all the speech articulators. The articulograph uses three or six transmitters that produce a weak alternating magnetic field. The magnetic field induces an alternating current in sensors that are affixed to the major speech articulators (tongue, jaw and lips), allowing one to obtain the distances of each sensor from the transmitters.  The spatial co-ordinates of the sensors as well as their angles are concurrently measured, stored and displayed in real time. The proposed item has 8 channels, which allow for highly accurate spatial (?0.01 mm) and temporal tracking of four or more motion points on the tongue and single motion points on the upper lip, lower lip, and jaw along with one reference point.  Based on these configurations, this device meets the requirements of our project since all the relevant two (and potentially three dimensional) movement and acoustic information related to normal or deviant speech articulation can be obtained simultaneously. The Articulograph AG200 will replace an outdated and discontinued articulograph system that was purchased by NIH in 1988. The configuration of the older device is not suitable for current research.  Carstens Medizinelektronik is the only source known to the NINDS that can provide the aforementioned instrument.   This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on September 16, 2002.   If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.

<DESC>The NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, Office of Protected Resources intends to negotiated on a non-competitive basis with the Marine Acoustics, Inc. NMFS requires an Acoustic Propagation Verification for a personal computer that is self contained in terms of the parameters that are need to make and display estimates.  Marine Acoustics, Inc. has recently developed an Acoustic Integration model that estimates "takes" of marine mammals from acoustic sources.  The AIM model was the primary means of estimating takes in Environmental Impact Statements for the North Pacific Acoustics Laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and the Navy's Low Frequency Active Sonar.  The AIM model amalgamates sound source characters, local environmental factors, animal population sizes, and the dive behavior of individuals as a function of range and depth, and can render this in either graphic or tabular form.  The calculations of safety zones is based on acoustic propagation loss which can be quite complex, depending on the environment and the kind of sound source used.  Errors in calculating safety zones can lead to large errors in estimating take levels.  The APV will include the governing user interface, graphics program, acoustic model, and all necessary supporting databases.  The APV will be made available as a PC based application intended only for NMFS headquarters.  It will have a single site license for a maximum of six workstations for a period of three years.  The contractor will provide training in the use of the APV only to NMFS headquarters personnel.   Award will be made under the Simplified Acquisition procedures.  All sources capable of satisfying this requirement are invited to submit proposal information as to their capabilities and any other pertinent data to the address listed by September 19, 2002.

<DESC>The NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Protected Resources intends to negotiation on a non-completive basis with ICF Information Technologies, Inc. to develop a web from end software for the Marine Mammal Authorization Program (MMAP).  The program will support integrating state and federal import of data of commercial fishermen in Category I and II.fisheries.   The Marine Mammal protection Act (MMPA) 118 requires NMFS to publish in the Federal Register a list of commercial fisheries and a statement describing the marine mammal stocks interacting with and the approximate number of vessels or persons actively involved in each commercial fishery.  Authorizations are granted to each person engaged in fishing in a category I and II fishery and must be obtained on a yearly basis.

<DESC>NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service, Office of Science and Technology plans to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Mr. James E. Kirkley to develop an IMPLAN model of the fisheries and gear types in the Mid-Atlantic States.  This work is in accordance with a wide array of federal legislation and policies which require the analysis of the potential economic impacts of fisheries management (ex., Sustainable Fisheries Act  through National Standard 8, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Executive Order 12866, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)).  NMFS needs to be able to access the economic importance of commercial fisheries and related sectors to the U.S. economy (i.e., processing, wholesale, distribution, and retail)).  The  Government requires the contractor to develop a strategy for an I/O model capable of providing estimates of the economic contributions of fisheries and related products to the U.S. economy.  There are six primary tasks:  (1) data/needs assessment for developing state/regional impact assessment models; (2) collection of secondary data or information from other sources necessary to develop a national I/O model; and  (3) construction of a national I/O model based on IMPLAN, an "off-the-shelf" software for developing I/O models; (4) develop EXCEL, or other spreadsheet-based I/O assessment framework; (5) estimate the economic importance of commercial fisheries and related products to the U.S. economy in terms of sales or output, income, and employment; and (6) prepare report summarizing research, the I/O model, impacts, and use of the I/O framework.  To better determine the needs of the agency relative to enumerating economic impacts, the contractor will review the following:  (1) all legislation that requires an assessment of the economic impacts of federal management or regulation; (2) existing and previous lawsuits that focused on issues related to economic impacts; (3) and agency policies that recommend an assessment of the potential economic impacts of management and regulation.  The review will focus providing information to the agency about when economic impacts must be assessed and the potential nature and scope of the types of impacts that must be assessed. The proposed work involves two major steps:  (1) data/needs assessment, and (2) development of national model and estimation of economic impacts of U.S. commercial fisheries and related products.  It is anticipated that the data/needs assessment will require approximately 6 months calendar time, approximately 32 hours.  The development of the national model and estimation of the economic impacts will require approximately 1,150 hours; that will be continuing over a 12 month period.  Award will be processed under the Simplified Acquisition Procedure.  All sources capable of satisfying this requirement are invited to submit proposal information as to their capabilities by the required due date, September 19, 2002.

<CONTACT>Jeanette C. Roybal Contract Specialist 5059886083     jeanette_roybal@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS), in conjunction with the Federal Highway Administration (FEWA) and the Denver Service Center (DSC), proposes to relocate approximately one-quarter mile of County Road-248 (locally referred to Ruins Road) within the boundaries of Aztec Ruins National Monument (AZRU).  The road section will be relocated about 60 meters south of the existing road and is necessitated by traffic safety concerns at the entrance to the AZRU visitor center and a curve near the southeast corner of East Ruin, and by concerns for damaging vibrations to the historic AZRU visitor center building and possibly the main ruins of the monument. To meet National Historic Preservations Act 106 compliance information needs, two phases of archeological testing have recently been conducted within the proposed new right-of-way alignment and resulted in the delineation of the western boundary of archeological site LA 1674 and added additional information to our knowledge of the depth and character of the archeological site.  However, the north, east and south boundaries of the site are not known nor is the general character of much of the buried deposits of the site.  OPTION A The general work to be performed by the Contractor includes:  - conduct a magnetic and resistance geophysical survey of approximately 13,200 square meters (3.3 ac) of     site LA 1674.  - interpret the results of that geophysical survey.  - if determined necessary (and approved by NPS),  ground-truth no more than three select anomalies by     conducting limited archeological excavation to determine their character.  - provide the results of this investigation in a report meeting professional standards, and   - provide the NPS with all materials generated during this project. OPTION B The general work to be performed by the Contractor includes:  - conduct magnetic, resistance, and ground penetrating radar geophysical surveys of approximately 24,000      square meters(5.9 ac) of site LA 1674.  - interpret the results of that geophysical survey.  - if determined necessary (and approved by NPS), ground-truth no more than six(6) select anomalies by    conducting limited archeological excavation to determine their character.  - provide the results of this investigation in a report meeting professional standards, and   - provide the NPS with all materials generated during this project.

M?xico C.P., 91700, email: raul@apiver.com, tel: + 229 9232170 ext. 2202, 2203  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for the Veracruz Port Expansion Project.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) has approved a grant to the Administraci?n Portuaria Integral de Veracruz, S.A. de C.V. (APIVER) for a feasibility study on the Veracruz Port Expansion Project.

The Port of Veracruz is Mexico?s largest port.  It handles an estimated 30% of total port traffic and 50 % of cargo that moves through the ports on the Gulf/Caribbean cost.  It is the gateway to Mexico?s industrialized and more densely populated central region. Cargo traffic increased from 8.2 million tons in 1994 to 13.7 million tons in 2000.  Total cargo throughput is estimated to grow to 28.4 million tons by 2010. Growth is expected to be driven primarily by grain and containerized cargo.  The port is also expected to handle increased traffic of automobiles, neo-bulks (such as steel), liquid bulk and general cargo.

APIVER?s expansion project is based on forecasts that its throughput capacity, especially in grain and containers, is likely to reach capacity by 2010.  The existing port?s long-term operations are constrained by a poor layout, the surrounding urban area that limits expansion options, vessel size restrictions (maximum draft is 14 meters), ship navigations difficulties and poor connections to road and rail networks.  APIVER needs to expand its terminal capacity in order to maintain the competitiveness of the port.

APIVER considered a number of potential sites for port expansion and concluded that Bahia de Vergara offers the best combination of location, development potential, environmental impact, and cost.  APIVER has conducted a number of studies to plan this project, including a Master Plan for port expansion; an analysis of potential sites; study of the environmental impact of the development of Bahia de Vergara; pre-feasibility of the Bahia de Vergara port expansion.

The estimated project cost is $7,816 million pesos (or US$840 million) over 25 years. The expansion project at Bahia de Vergara will cover a total 1,083 hectares, including 708 hectares of land for terminals, intermodal facilities and other port activities and an estimated 30 berths, including eight container berths, four grain berths, three liquid berths, three roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) berths, and two mineral berths.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $408,000 grant to the Grantee from TDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up.  Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 4:00p.m., local time Veracruz Mexico, Friday, October 11, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plans to issue an order on a sole source basis to Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Washington, DC, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) simplified acquisition procedures. The objective of the procurement is to develop infrastructure for evaluating the environmental performance on biobased products. The project will involve compiling existing datasets on eight feedstocks (corn, soybeans, canola, wheat/wheat straw, rice straw, cotton, wool, and starch from plants) and developing proposed environmental performance indicators linked to biobased products. During data compilation, the project investigators will gather information from existing sources, in the US and Europe.  The information gathered on upstream life-cycle phases for bioproduct harvesting will make it possible for a large number of biobased products to be evaluated on the basis of the most up-to-date, relevant data possible.  The project investigators will analyze and review the data and then prepare the dataset for each of the eight feedstocks.  The sources used in each of the datasets will be documented transparently according to the latest international life-cycle standards. Project investigators will start from the indicators developed for BEES 3.0 for building products and adapt these to biobased products.  Specific issues such as land use, land erosion, consumption and run-offs of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides will have to be taken into account and specific metrics will have to be defined and agreed upon both compilation of data and development of environmental performance indicators will be evaluated over the course of two meetings by an advisory board including representatives from the agricultural and life-cycle assessment communities.  The goals of the advisory board would be to validate the proposed approach for evaluating the environmental performance of biobased products, and assess the relevance of the agricultural datasets compiled under this project and identify any additional data sources.  Pricewaterhouse Coopers has unique knowledge to perform these services as they are the developers of the premier U.S. life cycle inventory database, and they have unique expertise in its application to BEES (Building for Environment and Economic Sustainability) and to biobased products. They successfully applied their database to the BEES evaluation of biobased motor oils and transformer oils for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1991 and 2001. The period of performance will be from date of award through September 30, 2003. The anticipated award date of this purchase order is on or about 5 days from the date of this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. Interested persons may identify their intent and capability to respond to this requirement no later than the response date above. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For information, call the POC identified below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This modification to BAA 02-16 outlines the adversary team (Red Team) requirements for the validation plan and final demonstration of the Survivable JBI architecture described in the original BAA.  Proposals submitted for this effort must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 4:00 PM (ET) Friday, September 27, 2002, in order to be considered during the initial Red Team proposal evaluation.  Amendments to both the FedBizOpps announcement and the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) are provided in the following paragraphs.  Organizations on teams awarded contracts for the Design Phase of this program will not be considered for this Red Team role.  The PROGRAM SCOPE section of the BAA is amended to include the following paragraph: An independent Red Team will be selected for the duration of this program.  This team will participate in the design phase by providing an assessment of the design factors by identifying weaknesses, flaws and ways and means of attacking the proposed architectures.  This will include identifying single points of failure in the architecture, residual vulnerabilities, and developing attack trees and validating the degree of difficulty of exploiting branches of the attack tree.  The Red Team will participate in "White Board" sessions with the designers, and participate with a Blue Team in developing Rules of Engagement for the final demonstration scenario.  One award up to $650K is expected to be made for the Red Team effort.  The BACKGROUND section of the PIP is amended to include the following sentence: One award is expected to be made for an independent Red Team effort that will span both phases and conclude with the sustained attack of the final demonstration.  Award for this effort is expected to be up to $650K.  The PROGRAM SCOPE section of the PIP is amended to include the following sentence: As part of the assessment, an independent Red Team will evaluate factors addressed by the competing architectures and the effectiveness of the resultant approaches.  The PROGRAM PHASE DESCRIPTIONS section of the PIP is amended to include the following paragraph:  An independent Red Team will be selected for the duration of this program.  DARPA expects to make one award up to $650K for this effort. This team will participate in the design phase by providing an assessment of the design factors by identifying weaknesses, flaws and ways and means of attacking the proposed architectures.  This will include identifying single points of failure in the architecture, residual vulnerabilities, and developing attack trees and validating the degree of difficulty of exploiting branches of the attack tree.  The Red Team will participate in "White Board" sessions with the designers, and participate with a Blue Team in developing Rules of Engagement for the final demonstration scenario.  This team will attempt to deny, disrupt, degrade or otherwise harm mission critical functionality of the JBI by conducting a prolonged, determined cyber attack during the final demonstration.  The GENERAL INFORMATION section of the FedBizOpps notice and the EVALUATION AND FUNDING PROCESSES section of the PIP are amended to include the following paragraph:  For evaluation purposes, a Red Team proposal is the document described in PROPOSAL FORMAT Section IV (see below).

<DESC>This is a draft request for proposal for acquisition of the Visual Information Management System (VIMS) for the Defense Visual Information (DVI) directorate of the American Forces Information Service (AFIS.)  This draft is published with the intention of obtaining comment from interested sources regarding acquisition approach, including the use of a Statement of Objectives (SOO) as a requirements specification document, the line item structure and the use of indefinite quantity line items to satisfy customer demand, as well as the use of the evaluation criteria shown in the draft RFP. The VIMS will help meet DVI modernization objectives by using advanced technologies to ingest, index, store, search, distribute, and manage Visual Information. The system will also supply DVI the ability to capture and automate the storage of motion media, still media, graphics, audio, and documents/text.  The SOO calls for innovative approaches to accomplish these objectives.  The line item structure is designed to promote innovation by allowing potential offerors the ability to configure solutions to various requirements within the generalized line item descriptions.  The indefinite quantity line item descriptions and the estimated annual quantities to be ordered against these line items are still being established at this time.  The overall structure of these line items can be determined by examining appendix 7 to the SOO.

All interested parties are advised that this is only a draft RFP.  It has not been subjected to higher headquarters review, and may change as a result of such reviews.  No offers will be accepted as a result of the publication of this draft RFP.  It is published merely to determine if there are any impediments in the approach taken to obtaining a system that meets the stated objectives.  This approach includes the use of indefinite quantity line items to make versions of the system available to authorized visual information activities according to their needs.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION IS TO PROVIDED CLARIFICATION TO THE ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS POSTED ON August 12, 2002.

The requirement is to procure an Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS) and related supplies and services for the CH-46E aircraft. The primary components of AIMS are an onboard Processor Unit, a Display Unit, and miscellaneous aircraft installation components. AIMS is a consolidation of support equipment functions, a majority of which are currently performed by the Chadwick-Helmuth 8500C or Chadwick-Helmuth VXP Balancer/Analyzer. 
An additional function of AIMS will be engine data acquisition. AIMS, when installed in the CH-46E aircraft, will provide for integrated rotor track and balance capability, continuous monitoring of vibration levels of all dynamic components and engine performance parameters. AIMS will also provide for future implementation of aircrew in-flight warnings for basic vibration exceedances and engine parameter exceedances. The benefits of an onboard monitoring system include the preservation of aircraft structure and electronic components life, tremendous reductions in maintenance man-hours due to enhanced trouble shooting /fault isolation and the elimination of ground support equipment requirements. The requirement includes the aircraft kits, ancillary hardware, and engineering services necessary to upgrade CH-46E aircraft.

The Government intends to procure these items on a sole source basis with Chadwick-Helmuth Company, El Monte, California. Chadwick-Helmuth was selected and qualified by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Boeing Helicopter, as the source for the 8500C Balancer/Analyzer, previous generation of the VXP Balancer/Analyzer. AIMS will use the same proven algorithms as developed for the 8500C and VXP systems. Since AIMS is simply the latest generation of the equipment we are already using with a few additional functions/capabilities, Chadwick-Helmuth is the only company that can meet the government?s needs within the timeframe required. The knowledge and experience on CH-46E rotor track and balance and vibration analysis resides at Chadwick-Helmuth. In addition, they own the proprietary data for the current systems that are being adapted for on aircraft monitoring vice routine maintenance being performed with support equipment. The duration of the BOA will be through October 2005.

The requirement is to procure Aircraft Integrated Maintenance Rotor Track and Balance systems (?AIMS systems?), and related supplies and services for the CH-46E Helicopter.  It includes aircraft kits, ancillary hardware, and engineering and technical services necessary to upgrade CH-46E aircraft.  The main components of the aircraft kit include: AIMS Processor Unit, Acquisition Control Unit, Memory Card, Sensors, Aircraft Installation components and Ground Software.  This product is an adaptation of the existing VXP Balancer/Analyzer previously procured from Chadwick-Helmuth for the CH-46E.   The AIMS monitoring system when installed in the CH-46E aircraft will provide continuous monitoring of rotor track and balance data, vibration levels of all rotating pumps and drive shafts and will provide aircraft crew and maintainers immediate feedback of the aircraft operating condition and engine performance. The Government intends to procure these items on a sole source basis with Chadwick-Helmuth Company, El Monte, California, which is the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System and the only known company with the knowledge, experience, and technical data required to fulfill this need.  Chadwick-Helmuth was selected and qualified by the Original Equipment Maintenance (OEM), Boeing Helicopter, as the source for the 8500C Balancer/Analyzer is currently being used for the CH-46.  The AIMS rotor tracker and balance system function will be performed using the same proven algorithms as developed for the 8500C system.  The duration of the BOA will be through October 2005.  note 22.

<DESC>Request for Information for Design of an Interactive Computer Driven Simulation Environment Modeling the Navy?s Enlisted Processing System

1.0 SUBJECT

This is a request for information (RFI) to develop an interactive (i.e. man-in-the-loop) computer assisted SIMulation modeling the business processes among three inter-related Navy groups, (1) Navy Personnel Plans & Policy (N13), (2) Commander, Navy Recruiting Command (CNRC) and (3) Chief of Naval Education and Training (CNET).  The purpose of the simulation exercise is to determine impact of policy changes using a systems approach.  The simulation is designated SimPPRT.

2.0 DESCRIPTION

CNRC is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of an interactive computer driven simulation, SimPPRT.  The simulation should enable the Navy?s Personnel triumvirate to participate in ?war gaming? sessions to test how proposed polices and budgetary decisions will impact the flow of Sailors through the initial training pipeline.  This should include simulating the impact on the recruit market and the flows through boot camp and ?A? school.  Such simulation games have been widely used to both train and evaluate combat.  To date the application of this technology to personnel situations has been limited.  

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

&#61607; Conceptual technical alternatives for a computer assisted simulation
&#61607; Technical feasibility assessments
&#61607; Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.)
&#61607; Schedule estimates
&#61607; Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing SimPPRT.

3.0 REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for SimPPRT.  For purposes of responding to the RFI an information exchange meeting will be held for interested parties (see Section 5.0 below). 

&#61607; SimPPRT must allow for each Navy personnel group to interact with the simulation in the conduct of simulated exercises (?war games?) from diverse locations (presumably via the Internet) in real-time mode.
&#61607; In addition to operating in an interactive mode, SimPPRT must have the capability to operate in a constructive context.  This capability can be either stochastic or deterministic.
&#61607; Access to SimPPRT must be platform independent and controlled by username and password.  It should allow users to logon independently or in-group sessions.
&#61607; SimPPRT must have the capability to save scenarios and a replay capability storing these scenarios in a library for future reference.  Users will be able to designate their scenarios as public or private.
&#61607; SimPPRT must be designed in modules that are capable of being run either independently or in concert.
&#61607; The modules should cover the planning process, the recruiting process and the training process.
&#61607; The planning module should model the impact of external events on requirements and resources and should handle the interactions between the other modules to minimize disturbances in the system.
&#61607;  The recruiting module should model the market supply and placement of recruits into the training pipeline with the appropriate quantity, quality and timing.
&#61607; The training module should model how recruiting results along with changes in resources and requirements impact training capacity and affect awaiting instruction time.
&#61607; SimPPRT must produce standard reports detailing all assumptions and pertinent results of scenarios.
The purpose of the RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.

4.0 SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE

Following is a suggested outline and for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit.

Section 1 ? Conceptual Alternatives

Briefly describe one or more architecture concepts for SimPPRT, including the hardware and software requirements for both client and server locations.  Discuss the flexibility for the architecture to expand the scope of the players and interaction in the future.

<DESC>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation, 41 USC 253, FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Census Bureau (BOC) intends to award a sole source contract to Anthony E. Dorsey for developmental support, operational support and consulting services associated with the conversion of the Decennial Census paper data collection to an automated data collection system. The Census Bureau is planning to collect data using Mobile Computing Devices (MCD's). This is a critical and massive undertaking designed to improve data quality and reduce costs on the 2010 Census. In addition, this is a pioneering effort both for the planning divisions and the operational divisions. The Contractor must have an in-depth knowledge of the Census Bureau's historical files, procedures, organizations, and operations. The need for staff with both technical expertise and the Census background is necessary.

The contractor will conduct an ongoing review of decennial specific hardware, , and Census designed software, used during the census tests and the census by Field Division at HQ and in the Regional Offices. The focus of this review will be on troubleshooting, identifying potential problem areas and suggesting or creating job aids and/or training materials to train all levels of field and automation support staff to quickly identify and resolve hardware problems. Mr. Dorsey is uniquely qualified to fill this critical need.  In addition to technical expertise in automation hardware and in creating, testing, supporting and troubleshooting software systems, he has insight into Census Field operations and procedures as well as experience in, and knowledge of regional field offices.   The contractor will review all written, automation related, training and field materials to ensure that the materials clearly reflect the actual technology and include all the critical skills. Over the past five years he has worked on a multitude of critical activities involved in the development and support of Census data collection. Mr. Anthony Dorsey has experience developing automated data collection controls and designing and documenting automated data collection instruments for use in widely dispersed, large, scale Decennial Census Field operations.  Mr. Dorsey designed and programmed a prototype Census Bureau data collection instrument for use on a small hand held mobile computing device, which was the first such instrument used by the Census Bureau. Mr. Dorsey possesses a unique combination of knowledge, ability and a unique set of experiences in automated data collection.

Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that they are capable of performing this work and interested sources should submit technical capabilities, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau's needs.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted in writing to DiJon Ferdinand or via email (dijon.f.ferdinand@census.gov) at the U.S. Census Bureau, Acquisition Division, Federal Building #3, Room #G-314, Washington, DC  20233.  

This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available.  If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days from the publication of this synopsis, a contract may be issued to Anthony E. Dorsey without further notice.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service is currently analyzing the market place for a Commercial-off the Shelf (COTS) Rules-Based Tax Computation Engine that can be integrated into existing and future software developed by the IRS to perform tax calculations for Form 1040 series Tax Returns for tax years beginning with 1999 to present.   A Rules-Based Tax Computation Engine consists of three components    (1) The Engine itself, which applies the rules against the Return Data and arrives at the new computed tax; (2) The rules, which are structured language English rules that tell the engine how to compute the tax, and are written by tax law specialists utilizing a Rules Editor; and (3) The Rules Editor, which is a tool that allows a tax law specialist to enter, modify and save the rules in a format that the tax engine can utilize.  The IRS is interested in those contractors that can provide a COTS software solution that is able to run in the following potential environments: (1) Windows 2000 XP Pro Workstation  callable by programs developed in any of the following languages: Visual Basic, Visual Basic.Net, C++, and/or Java; (2) Sun Server  callable by programs developed in any of the following languages: C++, and/or Java; and (3) Mainframe  callable by programs developed in any of the following languages: C++, COBOL, and/or Java.  The format of the data on which the calculation will be performed could be any of the following: ASCII, XML, Oracle, DB2, or MS SQL databases. The IRS may make available to the contractor current software and hardware environments to allow for integration within the necessary databases to conduct this integration.  Through this RFI, the IRS seeks interested parties to furnish capability statements with information illustrating the existence of experience in the development and integration of the services listed above.  Interested parties shall also provide cover information that includes company name, points of contact, telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses for points of contact, and identifies the company as one or more of the following: (1) small business, (2) 8(a), (3) HUBZone small business, (4) small disadvantaged business, (5) women-owned small business, (6) veteran owned small business, (7) service disabled veteran owned business, or (8) large business.  IRS will use the responses to this RFI in an assessment of the contractor?s ability to provide the above COTS software.  Based on the assessment, IRS will decide whether to issue a solicitation.  This RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Response to this RFI will not be considered as a proposal or offer, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responses should be addressed to Internal Revenue Service, Office of Information Systems Acquisitions, Attn: Dennis E. Smiley, 6009 Oxon Hill Road, Oxon Hill, MD 20745, or submit electronically to Dennis.Smiley@irs.gov.  All final written responses to this RFI must be received by 1:00 P.M. EST on Tuesday, October 8, 2002.  Point of contact is Mr. Dennis E. Smiley, Contract Specialist (202) 283-1643 or Dennis.Smiley@irs.gov.

<SUBJECT>46 -- Technology Transfer Opportunity -  Developing Methods for Concentrating Arsenic in Water
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is working towards developing methods for concentrating arsenic in water (patents pending) to facilitate the testing for arsenic levels in water samples.  These methods currently allow for the concentration of arsenic levels from ppb to ppm within an hour using simple equipment.  Resulting ppm levels of arsenic can then be assayed using less expensive and more readily available (i.e. field testing) equipment than is required for ppb arsenic concentrations.

Sandia National Laboratories is seeking partners in this effort.  Industrial partners with experience in developing both near-term and future applications of water treatment methods described would be of particular relevance.

For further information, please respond by mail or fax to Alane Dulski by October 9, 2002 at:  Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM 87185-0115; Fax (505) 844-8011.  Please indicate the date and title of this FBO notice and describe briefly the manner in which your firm could best contribute to the further development and/or commercialization of this technology.

<SUBJECT>Joint Tactical Radio System - Maritime (Cluster III)
<DESC>DESC: The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) PMW 179-1 is releasing the Joint Tactical Radio System Maritime Fixed (JTRS-M/F) Cluster III Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) and Draft Performance Specification Release to Industry for information and potential sources sought.  These documents are currently considered DRAFT and potential industry sources and industry questions/comments are being solicited by SPAWAR in response to this announcement. The drafts of the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and the Performance Specification are attached. The objectives of the Joint Tactical Radio System Maritime Fixed (JTRS M/F) Cluster III program is to acquire a family of multi-mode, multi-band, software programmable radios and associated RF distribution and control equipment.  The intent is to increase operational flexibility, enhance joint interoperability, and reduce life cycle cost. JTRS M/F will be capable of transmitting voice, video, and data while operating in frequency bands from 2 MHz to 2000 MHz with capability to migrate below 2 MHz and above 2 GHz in the future.  In order to facilitate an orderly and cost-effective migration from legacy systems, the new JTRS M/F shall maintain backwards compatibility with selected legacy systems and provide a seamless technological transition path to support the next generation radio room. For purposes of this informational request, the JTRS M/F will be defined as a complete end to end communications system with a combination of hardware elements, supporting software infrastructure, and government furnished waveform applications. This system will include all RF distribution and control equipment to support voice, video, and data communications. Appendix A of the draft performance specification describes numerous legacy systems that are color coded to define how the new JTRS M/F system may be procured and integrated into existing shipboard and fixed site radio rooms. The JTRS Program is a series of related but independent joint acquisitions. The Army is the Executive Service lead for the joint activities executed by the JPO.  The JPO is responsible for defining, developing, validating, and maintaining the SCA and acquiring software waveform applications.  The JTRS M/F (Cluster-3) Program Manager (Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, PMW 179-1) is responsible for developing JTRS M/F hardware and an SCA compliant operating environment to include porting independently acquired waveforms, integrating the waveforms, and fielding the JTRS M/F as a final consolidated product in support of the fleet.  One of the key goals of the system is to ensure maximum scalability, modularity, and extensibility across all ship classes and fixed site platforms. In addition to this sources sought and informational release, there will be a JTRS-M/F Industry Day scheduled for sometime in October 2002 in San Diego or in the Washington DC Area to discuss the JTRS-M/F acquisition program status.  This Industry Day is an open forum and all interested vendors are encouraged to attend.  Briefings will be conducted with industry describing current JTRS-M/F program status.  Individuals and business firms interested in attending the Industry day are requested to send e-mail notification to the Contracting Officer, Mark Lopez (e-mail address: lopezm@spawar.navy.mil) identifying the names and  citizenship of individuals who plan on attending and the firms represented. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, all responsible parties that can provide data to demonstrate that they may successfully propose/bid to produce the JTRS-M/F system (or subsystems that will support JTRS-M/F) in a free and open competition as called out in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and Specification are encouraged to do so.  Interested parties shall provide comments and questions pertaining to the understanding of the requirements and objectives of the draft performance specification and SOO.   The government is also interested in hearing from industry comments on: 1) Proposed system architectures 2) Suggested Contract type 3) Engineering Approach/Technical challenges 4) Porting GFE waveforms 5) SCA compliant hardware and Operating environment issues 6) System Design Tradeoffs between threshold and objective requirements 7) Cost drivers - What particular requirements significantly increase the system cost? 8) Identify key risk areas 9) Schedule - Design and production timeline 8)  ROM by channel and 4-channel increments Responses indicating vendor interest, comments and questions, and relevant past performance information shall be in writing and no longer than 35 pages.  All responses shall be e-mailed to mark.lopez@navy.mil.   Responses received by 2:00 PM PDT on 10 October 2002 will be considered as a possible topic discussion at Industry Day in October. All other responses will be conversed at a later date.  Questions or requests for additional information must be in writing and e-mailed to mark.lopez@navy.mil . Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms in the Small Business Administrations (SBA) Regions 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8(Wyoming) and those 8(a) firms with bona-fide places of business in these SBA districts (See http://www.sba.gov/regions/map/ to view Region Map).  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) to be selected from 8(a) firms, within specified SBA districts, that meet the qualification requirements as set forth in this announcement.  Those firms that can demonstrate that they meet the qualification requirements will be awarded a BOA.  The estimated period of performance for the BOAs will be one year (1) with the Navy reserving the right to exercise options for up to four years, with no single option exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703 (c).  BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the specified SBA District Offices.  While there may not be opportunities in every district within the regions cited, potential work has already been identified for the Jacksonville and Miami SBA Districts in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, and the Dallas/Fort Worth and Harlingen SBA Districts in Texas.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The Navy will compete task orders issued under the BOAs among the BOA holders.  Each task order that is issued under the BOA shall constitute a separate contract. Each task order may contain pre-priced options for the continued performance of environmental work under the task order.  The BOA firm will be required to furnish all labor, materials, tools, management, supervision, laboratory testing, engineering and equipment required of the task order.  If adequate competition cannot be obtained from the BOA firms within the designated SBA District, the Navy reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent Districts.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, however there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000 for each task order that can be awarded to an 8(a) firm. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work.  Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future orders with the Contractor or to require the Navy to solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only.

QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 

Contractors that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA.  Upon submission of your proposal, Technical and Contractual personnel will review the proposal and the contractor will be determined to be either Acceptable or Unacceptable.  Those contractors whose proposals are found to be Acceptable will receive a BOA.  If an offeror receives an Unacceptable rating in any qualification factor, that offeror will not be given a BOA.  In order to be considered for a BOA, your submission must be accurate and complete. The Navy does not contemplate having clarifications or discussions, however, it reserves the right to hold clarifications or discussions should it be necessary. The deadline for submitting the qualification information is 09 October 2002 @ 1600 hours (4:00pm ET). Those contractors who respond by this date will be evaluated for potential issuance of a BOA so they can immediately begin participating in the program. 

Contractual Factor 1:  SBA 8(a) certification.  This factor considers the information that a firm is certified in a given SBA District. A firm may be certified in multiple SBA Districts by having bona fide places of businesses in those SBA Districts.  This factor considers the certification of the 8(a) firm in those districts.  Offeror shall submit information demonstrating the SBA District in which it is certified.  An Acceptable rating will be given to the offeror who submits a copy of the certification letter from their servicing SBA District Office, indicating the SBA address, point of contact, and certification date of acceptance in the 8(a) Program.  An Unacceptable rating will be given to the proposal that does not contain this information.
	Contractual Factor 2: Registration in the Central Contractor Registration database (www.ccr.gov).  This factor considers whether or not the 8(a) firm is currently registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.  Offeror shall submit information demonstrating that it is currently registered in the CCR. An Acceptable rating will be given to the offeror who submits information demonstrating that it has a current registration in CCR. An Unacceptable rating will be given to the proposal that does not contain this information.
	Contractual Factor 3: Bonded/Insured NAICS Code 562910. The contractor may be required to furnish a bid bond with proposals over $25,000.  Performance and Payment bonds may also be required.

An Acceptable rating will result from the offeror submitting documentation on the above listed personnel who have received the required OSHA Safety training and have presented the necessary certification for these personnel. The certification shall also reflect that the training has been renewed on an as needed basis. An Unacceptable rating will result from the offeror providing little or no accreditation, certification or current licensing information for its proposed cadre of personnel.  
	Technical Factor 6: Key Personnel Resumes (education, background, experience, type reports written, to whom). This factor considers the individual employees qualifications in RAO/LTM environmental work and their work experience, (e.g. the type projects they have worked on, degree of involvement in those projects and who/how they communicated with during the projects (i.e., written or verbal reports to clients, regulators, community members)). Education of the personnel is also a consideration for this factor. The offeror shall present the resumes of the personnel they are proposing for this work.  An Acceptable rating will result from the preponderance of personnel resumes disclosing that education, work background, experience demonstrate relevant, comprehensive and cogent experience with environmental RAO/LTM type work as set forth in the above Scope of Work. An offeror that provides little or no information or provides resumes of proposed personnel that have little or no qualifying education or experience will receive an Unacceptable rating.

Team Disclosure
		a.  Please disclose in your proposal any teaming arrangements.  The name of the company, point of contact, address and telephone number should be included.
		b.  In order to establish your bona fide place of business, only the information concerning the Prime 8(a) firm will be taken into account.

The Prime 8(a) firm should provide its bona fide office information (address, point of contact, telephone/fax, email address) for each office location.

BOA Task Order Competition- Orders issued under the BOAs will be competed among BOA holders. Each solicitation for an order will indicate the degree of detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time.  Individual orders will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms, and performance schedule. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. The contractor will be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors as well as a price proposal.   LIMITATION OF ORDERS:  The average range will be from $5,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000.   However, the Navy has no obligation to issue any orders under any BOA.
	1.  Competing for BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to those BOA holders in a given SBA District where the work will be performed.  
	2.  If sufficient competition or interest is not found in the given SBA District, the Navy will seek competition from adjacent districts by allowing those BOA holders to participate in the Task Order competition.
	3. The BOA holders will receive a request for proposal (RFP) from Southern Division.  The RFP will contain a Statement of Work describing the type of environmental remedial action operation (RAO) or long-term management (LTM) the Navy requires. Schedules, performance criteria and historical data for the particular system may be provided.  
	4. The BOA holders will respond with a Technical proposal detailing the requested information necessary to operate or maintain the described environmental system and will provide a firm-fixed Price Proposal for the requested services. 
	5. The Proposals will be reviewed using either Best Value or Low Price Technically Acceptable criteria. The best value process may consider such factors as Key Personnel, Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.   Best Value is a method of evaluation, which allows the combination of technical considerations in combination with price to provide the greatest overall value to the Navy.  The RFP will inform the BOA holders the method of evaluation, either Best Value or Low Price Technically Acceptable.

<DESC>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

Q1.	Will firms be able to enter the BOA Program after the initial submittal?
A1.	Yes, we plan to open the BOA pool semi-annually for new qualifying firms.

Q2.	What is the difference between low price vs. low price - technically acceptable vs. best value proposals?
A2.	Low price technically acceptable implies technical qualifications that low price does not.  See FAR Subpart 15.3 for best value. We anticipate using only low-price technically acceptable or best value criteria.

Q3.	Please explain, ?BOAs up to $3M is not competitive??
A3.	In the 8(a) program, projects under the $3M threshold are not competitive; but must be sole sourced.  SouthDiv received a waiver from SBA to compete projects under the $3M threshold.

Q4.	Please identify the SBA Districts applicable to the program?
A4.	http://www.sba.gov/regions/map/ SBA region map shows the Regions in SouthDivs AOR. There are approx. 30 SBA Districts within our AOR.

Q5.	If you have, say 10 BOA firms for a given SBA District, are you accepting 10 proposals from them or will you request proposals from only a selected number of firms?
A5.	We would be soliciting those firms holding BOAs within the SBA district where the work is to be accomplished.

Q6.	Once you have a BOA are you required to compete or are some task orders sole source?
A6.	The Navy plans to compete each requirement.

Q7.	In landfill remediations where there are lots of unknown contaminants, will tasks be based on fixed price and what will be the procedure for non-scope work encountered?
A7.	The Task Orders will be fixed priced and contain the Changes clause.

Q8.	Do you see the BOAs being used earlier in the CERILA/RCRA process than O&M or LTM (example, asbestos abatement)?
A8.	No, strictly RAO/LTM work, not R/A type work.

Q9.	Do you expect any Conflict of Interest between RAO and LTM?
A9.	No.

Q10.	Can 2 or more 8A firms join to go after a BOA, if so how will they be credited?
A10.	Yes, however they must still meet the size standard for the NAICS Code applicable. They will be evaluated under a teaming arrangement and only one BOA will be issued to the 8(a) firm identified as the Prime. 

Q11.	Service contracts (Remedial Actions) do not require (by 13CFR or FAR) offices to be located in the SBA District or geographic area of the work.
a.	Therefore, is it simply a condition of the contract that an office be in each respective district and or has there been a change to 13CFR or the FAR for this requirement?
b.	In a Joint Venture, teaming, or mentor prot?g? arrangement do the offices of the JV, MP, or team member counts toward this requirement? How about a subcontractor address?

A11a.	 There has been no change to the regulations. Although SBA can only impose geographical restrictions in construction, SBA and the Navy agreed to this requirement for these BOAs.
A11b.  No, the Prime 8(a) firm?s location will always be the indicator.
