<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: This requirement is to provide technical support for the 524 EMXS's CAST EMT 3500-3 Maintenance Test System. The United States Air Force (USAF) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with CAST Navigation LLC under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(1)(b).<br /><br />The CAST Navigation Test Stations function, is to test multi-million dollar aircraft electronic components.&nbsp; Sustainment of this stand is critical to the functioning of the weapons systems that it directly supports. The performance of CAST Navigation Test Station and it highly specialized ability to support multiple weapons system effectively, is essential to the mission of the 309th EMXG. Without the CAST Navigation Test Station(s) the 309. USAF believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delay to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. To procure another test station not already developed, would duplicate the effort and increase the cost required by the initial procurement of the CAST Navigation Test Station. Also, there is an issue of compatibility with existing hardware and software already procured from CAST Navigation. CAST <br /><br />CAST Navigation LLC is the OEM and provides fully trained and certified staff on its proprietary Navigation system. This proprietary systems includes both hardware and software, which is available exclusively to CAST Navigation. <br />In addition, CAST Navigation LLC is the only source for factory-certified, OEM replacement parts.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511, and the size standard is $27.5M.<br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (MST) on 10 Nov, 2015. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to david.bryan.8@us.af.mil. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a size standard of $38.5M.
<p>AFRL requires the purchase of a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for Mathworks software and software maintenance. The products to be acquired under this contract consist of Mathworks software, including Matlab, Simulink, and PolySpace product families as well as add-on toolkit and Blockset modules, which are available through the company's commercial product list. In addition, this contract will provide maintenance, support, and license renewals in periods not to exceed one year. The exact quantities and delivery times are not known in advance.</p>
<p>Market research revealed that possible alternative mathematical software available on the open market would not be fully interoperable with the current Mathworks platforms in use throughout AFRL nor do they possess the full suite of products required. The software development effort required to convert these products to be compatible with existing Mathworks platforms would require significant research, testing, and programming resources, as well as training for Government users and conversion of existing work. In addition, some of these products are community-based and, as such, have uncertain maintenance and support capabilities.</p>
<p>Mathworks is not directly available through a pre-existing Government-wide contract or DoD Enterprise Software Agreement. Establishing an IDIQ will eliminate duplicative efforts with respect to acquisition planning, small business coordination, solicitation, and pre-award evaluation.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for the purchase of the software licenses and maintenance described above. The identified sole-source provider/producer of these systems is as follows:</p>
<p>THE MATHWORKS, INC<br />3 APPLE HILL DR<br />NATICK, MA 01760</p>
<p>The Government believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force's requirements including duplicative acquisition planning, coordination, and evaluation, as well as costs related to training, installation, software development, engineering, maintenance, and support, that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Tabitha.Haggart@us.af.mil</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 11 December 2015.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

<DESC>Reference Sources Sought Notice that was posted under Reference Number HHS-NIH-ORF-SBSS-15-0001, this pre-solicitation notice provides information with regards to the Office of Research Facilities (ORF), NIH intent to issue a solicitation to WFT Engineers as described in the attached Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition for Post Design Architectural and Engineering Services. The A/E of Record, MW Design, a Joint Venture, was performing Post-Design services under Contract HHSN29220070009I, Order HHSN29200040. MW Design has notified the Government that effective September 30, 2015 MW Design would cease to exist. Hence, the task order was terminated.
<p>The ORF Program is seeking a reasonable path to obtain Post Design services immediately or as soon as possible since this complex, technically difficult, multiple phase electrical infrastructure replacement project has been awarded and is underway. Submittals and RFIs have begun to arrive; however, no A/E of Record is available to provide responses. Based on this, the ORF has suspended the construction pending the post design award.&nbsp; It is essential that Post-Design services be continued throughout the construction performance. The project will provide for a continuation of Post Design services, under a new contract, after September 24, 2015.</p>

<RESPDATE>111115

<CONTACT>Paula Cubillos, Acquisition Specialist, Phone 2022166213, Email pcubillos@usaid.gov - Curtrice Dorsey, Contracting Officer, Email cdorsey@usaid.gov
<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development's Mission in Colombia (USAID/Colombia) intends to award a contract modification to Tetra Tech ARD for the continued provision of strategic specialized technical assistance services and support the Government of Colombia's (GOC) Consolidation policy. In doing so, it allows USAID to make crucial contributions to the GOC's efforts in preparing for peace - the primary foreign policy priority for the USG in Colombia.
<p>The modification will provide a 12-month extension of these services at an expected cost of $15.2 million, which does not increase the total estimated cost (TEC) of $114,953,981 for contract no. AID-514-C-11-00002 awarded on April 20, 2011. The additional funds resulted from an unanticipated currency fluctuation. The $15.2 million in funding will be distributed in the following components: Economic Development, Social Infrastructure, Good Governance, Social Development and Cross Cutting.</p>
<p>USAID's CELI / Central mechanism was designed to support the Colombian National Territorial Consolidation Program, which focuses on increasing state presence and legitimacy in contested conflict territories to enable greater citizens' security and licit means of livelihood. USAID's contribution has resulted in significant gains by helping the GOC build democratic citizenship, licit market linkages and improved government performance in a sustainable, replicable manner.</p>
<p>The authority permitting other than Full and Open Competition is AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5), an award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays.</p>
<p>Award of the contract modification is planned for December 15, 2015. <br />Interested organizations may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement</p>

<DESC>SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is operated by Stanford University for the Department of Energy. As a management and operating contractor, subcontracts awarded by the Laboratory are not Federal procurements, and are not directly subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations in 48 CFR. Nonetheless, certain Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations may affect our DOE approved purchasing system, as required by statute, regulation, or contract terms and conditions.
<p>Sources sought for:<br /><br />An Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) that can convert 20-60 fs pulses of 800nm pump to 1140-2600nm pulses. The OPA needs to be able to accept pump pulse energies as high as 20mJ @ 20-30 fs and produce tunable IR pulses of up to several millijoule of energy.<br /><br />For 10mJ, 800nm Gaussian beam pump at 1 KHz, the energy of hte converted light (Signal + Idler) should be at least 2.5 mJ. The output pulse duration should be 1.2 to 1.5 times the pump pulse width. The time-bandwidth product shoudl be &lt;1.<br /><br />Source selection is lowest price technically acceptable method.</p>

NSRDEC has developed initial flexible device prototypes based on a combination of textiles, polymer gels, and silicone in the lab. The silicone material needs to interface with the textile and ultimately encapsulate the entire flexible device. We have proved out an initial device assembly process in the lab. However, there is still a need to optimize and standardize a procedure for silicone incorporation to scale-up our devices. This specialized equipment is not available in-house. Therefore, NSRDEC requires a low volume prototype, silicone molding company that (1) has extensive experience working with a wide range of silicones, (2) can quickly make customized molds for silicone packaging in-house to produce silicone films as thin as 125 m, and (3) work closely with NSRDEC in the device design process.  The silicone molding company shall provide services that include: <br>  <br> (1)	CNC milling for customized silicone molds, <br> (2)	Silicone research, development and engineering (RD&E) services, <br> (3)	Possess a wide array of silicone incorporation processes, to include injection molding and overmolding, and capability to analyze silicone molding quality, <br> (4)	Access to a wide range of silicone material supply, <br> (5)	Documentation of RD&E services that contributes to the final design (CAD files, production images, etc.) <br>  <br> Estimated Period of Performance: 01 January 2016 - 30 March 2016 <br>  <br> Responses:  All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  Information submissions should include available technology, capabilities, product literature, relevant company background/experience, contact information and cage code. Available product pricing may also be provided as part of the information submission. <br> Information submissions must be received by 10 November 2015. <br>  <br> Responses to this notice should be directed to stephanie.f.zopf.civ@mail.mil and christina.l.lewis23.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be taken as a future commitment by NSRDEC. <br>

<p>THIS IS STRICLY MARKET RESEARCH. NIAID/DAIDS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p>Background<br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of AIDS (DAIDS) supports the advancement of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supports the development of HIV/AIDS vaccines and other prevention measures. DAIDS sponsors more than 150 Phase I, II, III and IV clinical trials at over 150 clinical research sites in over 17 countries to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutics, vaccines and other preventive modalities. Over the past five years, the incumbent has conducted more than 90 work requests to support the DAIDS clinical research portfolio in the areas of clinical research, laboratory and training. The current contract for this work is entitled "HIV Clinical Research Support Services" (CRSS) and the incumbent contractor is Westat, contract number HHSN272201200009C.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of the proposed contract is to provide a broad range of clinical research support services to the current and evolving NIAID/DAIDS-supported clinical research portfolio and other infectious diseases that are of relevance to HIV infection and at risk populations, and to assist NIAID in the development and maintenance of a strong and responsive clinical infrastructure. Primary objectives are to provide a responsive and flexible infrastructure/base for both recurring and ad hoc support services to meet the scientific/technical requirements of the DAIDS research portfolio. This contract also has the objective to serve as a gap-filling mechanism to provide urgent or unanticipated services for emerging or evolving needs and provide prompt access to subject matter experts, consultants and subcontractors.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />a. Specifically, the CRSS contract will be responsible for the following: Provide clinical site research support activities to include capacity assessment, capacity building, audits to assess compliance with Federal regulatory and in-country requirements, and targeted site training.</p>
<p>b. Provide clinical trial support including support services for study-specific document preparation, translations, data management, biostatistical design and analysis, and project management.</p>
<p>c. Conduct laboratory audits to include good clinical laboratory practices (GCLP), current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) to assess compliance with Federal regulatory requirements and DAIDS policy requirements and perform other related laboratory support work.</p>
<p>d. Provide training support to include review and revision of training materials for support and management of DAIDS Learning Portal (DLP), training warehouse, and DLP help desk support.</p>
<p>e. Coordinate and collaborate with other DAIDS grantees and clinical research support contractors in the performance of the Performance Work Statement as listed in Attachments entitled "DAIDS Extramural Clinical Trial Portfolio" and "Current NIAID/DAIDS Clinical Research Support Contracts".</p>
<p>f. Project management and quality assurance for individual projects and for the overall contract.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance<br />It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) performance based type contract will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus six (6) one-year options (terms) that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible performance period of seven (7) years, beginning on or about May 15, 2017. The requirement will be for the delivery of 48.10 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and each option period (Years 2 through 7).</p>
<p>In addition to the above functions and services to be provided for the Base period, the Government may exercise, at its discretion, Options for additional level of effort to accommodate significant increases in work. These Options are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Option 1 - 6: Extend the Term of the Contract: The Government may exercise options to extend the term of the contract beyond the Base period (Year 1), annually, for a total contract period of up to 7 years of the performance.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Announcement.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), James A. Haley A. Haley Veterans Hospital, located in Tampa, FL, is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of businesses capable and interested in providing the service in accordance with the attached Statement of Work, for the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital, Tampa, FL.

This is a request for information only, the announcement number is VA248-16-N-0079.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS, OR BIDS. THE VA RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SOLICIT THIS SERVICE AS APPROPRIATE.

Contractor shall provide services in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) below:

Custom fabrication of the components of the Angel hands prototype
James A. Haley VA Hospital/Research Service
Background  
	This proposal is for the development and evaluation of a sling-less alternative to current patient lift devices, called 'Angel Hands', by inventor, Gary Kluckhuhn.  Angel Hands is a prototype medical device, designed to lift and transfer a person with a disability or injury from one surface to another--such as from bed to wheelchair and back-more quickly, easily and with much less caregiver exertion, minor patient discomfort, and minimal risk of injury to both than is possible with current systems. It is designed to accomplish patient lifting, repositioning, and transfer with one caregiver (and potentially autonomously by the patient alone), without requiring the caregiver to engage in any strenuous activity whatsoever. Angel Hands does not require the use of a fabric body sling, into which patients must be manually manipulated (i.e., their torso or other parts of their body lifted and/or their entire body rolled to properly position the sling) by as many as three or four caregivers (depending on patient size). Rather, patient lifting and transferring is accomplished by means of a pair of micro-processor controlled, mechanically driven opposing arms, in a clamshell configuration, which gently close beneath the patient to lift, and open to transfer-and feature powered belts on the contact surfaces to minimize friction. Angel Hands is designed to operate seamlessly with overhead lift systems in VA Medical Centers, nursing homes, other healthcare facilities and private patient homes (though still far less prevalent than floor lifts and other transfer devices). Instead of a sling, Angel Hands uses curved, opposing mechanical arms, which gently close together beneath the patient. Powered belts that wrap around the top and bottom surfaces of each arm allow the "hands" to slip gently between the users' body and the surface upon which they are resting. A current Angel Hands prototype has shown considerable promise in its capacity to lift and transfer a person more quickly, simply, and with much less caregiver exertion than sling-based systems.  This development will be completed and perform computer-based finite element analysis of the Angel Hands system, assembly the prototype and conduct extensive laboratory testing. Then, by means of focus groups and clinical trials, we will evaluate the technology in institutional settings, where its performance will be compared to conventional sling-based lift devices. We anticipate that the next generation of Angel Hands will perform very favorably in this comparison in terms of injury risk, usability and efficiency, and that this will lead to definitive full scale clinical trials and subsequent commercialization. The adoption of Angel Hands in VA hospitals and nursing homes could revolutionize dependent patient care, by substantially reducing caregiver injuries as well as time devoted to patient handling tasks, and thus present substantial savings in healthcare costs to VHA. Other compelling potential benefits include enhanced independence for persons with disabilities who may be able to operate the device without assistance.

<DESC>The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) and Army Cyber Command and Second Army (ARCYBER &amp; 2A) are initiating a Cyber Innovation Challenge for a software-based prototype model. The intent of the challenge is to evaluate the technical feasibility of a risk-based Cyber Situational Awareness (SA) capability tool at echelon. <br />As part of the global mission in cyberspace operations, Cyber SA can be decomposed into functions that rely upon technical elements such as analytics, storage, and visualization. This Cyber Innovation Challenge effort is focused specifically on the commander's ability to visualize the cyber risk posture associated with the networks and assets supporting the mission space. The visualization capability includes, but is not be limited to, various types of data sources such as network topology, friendly asset and open-source information, key-user and threat activity information, and overlays of cyber assets on terrain, while supporting interoperability with external mission-command systems. This type of approach allows for the aggregation of information in an Area of Operations (AO) to build a complete Cyber SA risk posture. In order to operate successfully in cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum, Cyber SA at this echelon must support Department of Defense (DoD) information-network operations and offensive and defensive operations. <br />As previously stated, the Cyber SA Innovation Challenge is focused on providing commanders and staff elements at the Brigade (BDE) level tailorable and time-relevant SA data, which facilitate risk-based decision-making. Therefore, the capability must include the ability to understand the cyber posture of the commander's area of responsibility, accounting for all segments of the battlespace (i.e., blue, red and grey). Based on relevance and classification level, the tool must allow for shareable data among the stakeholder community, support analytics on local data stores, and modeling and simulation activities as part of the overall cyber-execution model. The challenge's overarching goal is for the selected awardee(s) to deliver software-based Cyber SA prototype solution for which an operational evaluation of the capabilities' technical feasibility across various mission areas can be made. <br />An Industry Day is planned for mid-November in the National Capital Region which will provide Industry/Academia the opportunity to obtain further details and engage in discussion on Government requirements with the Government sponsors. Details of the Industry Day will be provided in a forthcoming notice, which will highlight Army requirements and the framework of a follow on Cyber Innovation Challenge event. This Industry Day will serve as an initial opportunity for interested members of industry and academia to meet and discuss details with key Army stakeholders, Army Cyber, TRADOC Cyber Center of Excellence (CoE), ASAALT Program Executive Offices (PEOs). Advance information can be obtained by contacting Mr. Larry Jennings at larry.l.jennings8.ctr@mail.mil.<br />The requirement will be released through an existing consortium community and will utilize Other Transaction Authority (OTA) as the framework, allowing industry to engage with government. This Industry Day is open to all interested parties across Government, industry, and academia.
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals or Request for Quote, but for planning purposes only. A contract award will not be made from this announcement. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of industry advanced notification of government intent.</p>

<DESC>Description:  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the Navy Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), the Naval Enterprise Networks Program Office (PMW 205), and the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) will host an Industry Day on 17 November 2015, at the following location:  Crystal Gateway Marriott 1700 Jefferson Davis Highway Arlington, Virginia 22202 08:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  Scope of Industry Day: The purpose of this announcement is to invite businesses to an Industry Day event that will allow the Government to gather information to assist the Navy and Marine Corps in determining an acquisition approach for any potential NGEN follow-on contract(s).  Information from this event and any future RFIs may be used to help the Navy determine the number, timing, structure (e.g., contract type), terms and conditions, and tasks of any potential contract(s) that may be issued as follow-ons to the current NGEN contract. As part of the days agenda, PMW 205 representatives and members of the Navy/USMC acquisition community will provide:  (1) present-day views of USN and USMC network scope and scale; and (2) conceptual views of the re-compete scope of effort, future portfolio of services, and future acquisition/procurement approach.  The Industry Day will incorporate panel discussions to facilitate the desired information exchange between Government and industry.  The Government intends to leverage service delivery infrastructure mechanisms that include: (a) the Navy Marine Corps Intranet; (b) the Marine Corps Enterprise Network; and, (c) the cloud, to include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS).  The key tenets of any potential future contracts include: global reach; speed to delivery; cloud-based services; innovation; mobility; data analytics; and, cybersecurity.  PMW 205 encourages small business participation in the Industry Day to increase the visibility of potential small business opportunities in the NGEN follow-on contracts.  Registration: Registration is limited by venue capacity and early registration is strongly recommended to expedite event check-in. Attendees may register via e-mail by sending a request to NGEN_Industry_Day@navy.mil including your name, company name, CAGE, names of attendees (five maximum), phone number(s), and e-mail addresses.  Registered attendees will be provided additional information regarding directions, parking, check-in, etc., one week prior to the event. Registration on the day of the event will begin at 7:00 a.m. Please plan to arrive early.  Organizations are limited to five (5) attendees. However, in the event the Industry Day is over- or  under-subscribed, PMW 205 reserves the right to adjust participation limits as necessary. The cut-off date for pre-registration is November, 15 2015, at 1600 EST.  There is no fee for any Industry Day activity.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Emesis Bags. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MN 1412-04_Emesis Bags are eligible for participation. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Emesis Bags products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the subject QSL. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is December 2015. Among vendors who are on the subject QSL, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Emesis Bags.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required.<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Emesis Bags. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $450,881 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.
<p><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the subject QSL who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below</strong>. In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-16-Q-200016 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-84 effective 5 October 2015.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p>See attached documents titled: <br />1) Requirements - HSCG38-16-Q-200016, for a list of required parts.<br />2) Terms and Conditions - HSCG38-16-Q-200016, for applicable clauses, instructions, and evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. <br />Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>
<p>NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 02 November 2015 at 4:15 pm EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 3 November 2015. E-mail quotations are preferred and may be sent to dawn.b.oconnor@uscg.mil. Please indicate HSCG38-16-Q-200016 in subject line. Quotations may also be mailed to the following address:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>1. Are you looking for just scripts or the entire production and end product to be delivered?</p>
<p>Entire production.  However, please note response to #2.  In addition, as noted in the statement of work, "the format will be a 30 minute scripted satire produced by a team with a demonstrated ability to engage and entertain audiences in Cuba."</p>
<p>2. To what extent does the Licensee expect that the Licensor will provide the production talent and crew (such as host, supporting actors, cameraperson, makeup artist, editor) and post/production facilities (such as camera equipment, studio space, editing equipment) on a weekly basis to produce the 10 episodes?</p>
<p>OCB is willing to provide certain production elements and technical personnel, but not talent.</p>
<p>3. Within responses to the RFQ, will pages dedicated to a Table of Contents, List of Acronyms and Abbreviations, and additional annexed visual aids be counted in the total six-page limit?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>4. Is the correct solicitation number listed in the solicitation title (BBG50-Q-16-1020MD) or in the body of the solicitation (BBG50-Q-16-1015MD)?</p>
<p>The correct solicitation number is BBG50-Q-16-1020MD, and the RFQ has been amended to reflect that.</p>
<p>5. Is this a follow-on requirement? If so, could you please provide the incumbent contract number for this opportunity? If not, is this a new requirement?</p>
<p>This is a new requirement.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.

The following pertains to this Amendment:


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q1.  Criterion 1, definition of a project:  The solicitation identifies the following to be considered a project:  a task order on an IDIQ contract, a standalone contract, or an IDIQ contract.  Would multiple task orders at the same site/installation be considered a project if the presented task orders are under a single IDIQ contract and are substantially complete?  

A1.  No, part of an IDIQ will not be considered a project.  A project can be one task order, one standalone contract, or one entire IDIQ contract.

Q2.  Criterion 1, definition of a complete IDIQ program:  For ongoing IDIQ contracts, will the Government allow offerors to present completed task orders under that IDIQ program as a project, if the work described in the project relates only to those completed task orders?  

A2.
  Again, you may submit completed or substantially completed task orders individually as projects or the entire IDIQ contract as a project.  Multiple task orders under an IDIQ may not be combined to make one project.

Q3.  Criterion 8, DoD work awarded within the past 12 months:  Does the dollar amount include new awards only, or new awards and modifications to existing awards?  For example, if a task order awarded in 2013 was modified in March 2015, should the $ amount of that modification be included in the volume of work?  

A3.  The reported dollar amount should include new awards and modifications to existing awards.

Q4.  Page limits:  Would the Government confirm the following are NOT included in the 70-page limit:  Part IIs, copies of ISRs, copies of JV agreements, copies of PPQs and/or CPARS/ACASS ratings, Small Business Subcontracting Plan draft, proof of firmâ€™s registration/licensure as an architectural and/or engineering firm by state, and letters of commitment from subcontractors?

A4.
  Correct, the above attachments are not included in the 70-page limit.

Q5.  Page limits:  If offerors include an acronym list, is the acronym list included in the 70-page count?

A5.  Yes. 

Q6.  Font limits:  Would the Government allow use of 10-point font for tables or graphics?

A6.  No.  Please use 12-point font for all parts of the proposal.

Q7.  Please confirm that a Prime NAVFAC Atlantic remedial action contractor has an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and is prohibited from pursuing the CLEAN contract since the potential exists that same firm might remediate the sites they investigated as part of the CLEAN contract?

A7.  Please see the posted synopsis and NFAS 5252.209-9300 Alt I.

Q8.
  Please confirm that recent experience for resumes under Criterion 2 can include the last ten years.  

A8.  Yes.

Q9.  Please confirm that ACASS/CPARS for IDIQ contracts used in Section F should be submitted for only the work featured in the project description given that some IDIQ contracts have hundreds of task orders.

A9.  No, if an IDIQ contract is submitted as a project, please submit all available ACASS/CPARS evaluations for task orders under the IDIQ.

Q10.  Please confirm subparagraphs 1 and 2 under Criterion 4 Safety are separate from the two page limit for Technical Approach to Safety under subparagraph 3.

A10.  Yes.

Q11.  Please confirm that we are to show registration/licensure as an architectural and/or engineering firm only for the states listed in Criterion 2 of the solicitation.

A11.
  No, please provide proof that your firm is permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering (i.e. state registration, a brief explanation of the firmâ€™s licensing in states that do not register firms, etc.) for all states covered by the contract, as shown in the third paragraph of the posted synopsis.

Q12.  For the Part IIs, may we use 10 Pt font for columns A and B for both item 9. Employees by Discipline and item 10. Profile of Firms experience, which is generally consistent with the template from GSA?  Please confirm that the GSA specified footers for the SF 330 Part 1, Sections A through I are allowed to be the GSA provided 9 point font.  We recognize the Navys desire for legible documents, and would respectfully request the ability to include tables using an 11 point font to provide the lengthy tabular information requested, such as list of engineering and architecture state registrations/licenses.

A12.
  No.  Please use 12-point font for all parts of the proposal.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001, DATED OCTOBER 27, 2015: The purpose of this amendment is to add a definition for self-performance to Criterion 2, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, as well as add an additional submission requirement to state the A-E fees for the project, and state percentage of project that was self-performed by the prime A-E firm. (REVISED SYNOPSIS BELOW AND REVISED ALSO ATTACHED)

DESCRIPTION: ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO SEPARATE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD. 

THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE PROCUREMENT.  A market research study was conducted by NAVFAC Southwest that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.
  Upon review of the market research, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) in San Diego determined that a Small Business Set-Aside procurement is appropriate.  The NAVFAC SW small business office concurs with the SBA determination.

Architect-Engineer (A-E) services are required for a firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Facility Planning Services.  The work for this contract shall occur at various Navy and Marine Corps facilities and other government installations located in the NAVFAC Southwest Area of Responsibility (AOR): California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. Projects could also be located at other Navy and Marine Corps facilities and government installations in the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, as approved by the NAVFAC SW Procuring Contracting Officer.
  The preponderance of work is expected to be in Southern California. The Offeror/Contractor must demonstrate adequate in-house staffing capable to self-perform at least 50 percent of the cost of the contract as required by FAR Clause 52.219-14 (b)(1) Limitation on Subcontracting.

Required A-E services are for, but not limited to: 

1.	PRIMARY A-E services

PROJECT PLANNING DOCUMENTS: Military Construction (MILCON) and Special Project planning documentation (DD Form 1391) using Electronic Project Generator (EPG);  demolition / footprint reduction;  preliminary and parametric cost estimates; life cycle analysis; economic analyses (using the latest version of the Governmentâ€™s ECONPACK software); site approvals (ordnance, explosive safety, etc.); Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP); Asset Evaluations (AE); Basic Facilities Requirements (BFR) documentation; Facilities Planning Documents (FPD) using the governmentâ€™s web-based iNFADS program.

2.	SECONDARY A-E services

The maximum contract value may not exceed $30,000,000 aggregate total. The minimum guarantee for the contract shall be $5,000. The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial task order. The minimum value of individual task orders executed under this contract is $150,000. The maximum value of individual task orders executed under this contract is $1,500,000. There will be no dollar limit per year. Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates. Contract term is for a one-year base period with four option periods.
 Each performance period will run 365 (366 for leap year) calendar days. The hourly rates will be negotiated for each performance period. The Government may exercise the option period unilaterally. The estimated start date is June 2016.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541320 (Landscape Architectural Services) and the annual small business size standard is $7.5 Million.

The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered.  The contractor is not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. This limitation also applies to subsidiaries/affiliates of the firm. 

SELECTION CRITERIA AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: The Selection of Architects and Engineers, formerly the Brooks Act (PL 92-582), and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6 selection procedures apply.
 The evaluation and selection will be based on the following criteria: Criterion 1, Professional Qualifications; Criterion 2, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence; Criterion 3, Capacity; Criterion 4, Past Performance; Criterion 5, Location and Knowledge of the Locality; Criterion 6, Sustainable Design; Criterion 7, Quality Control; and Criterion 8, Volume of Work. SF 330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm based on criterion responses. Criteria 1 and 2 are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are slightly less important and listed in descending order of importance; and Criteria 8 is of lesser importance and will be used as a tiebreaker among technically equal firms.
  Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. In evaluating an Offerorâ€™s capability, the Government shall consider how well the offeror complied with these instructions. All projects provided in the SF 330 (Architect-Engineer Qualifications) must have been completed by the office/branch/individual team member actually performing the work under this contract.

SF 330, Part 1, Section F, Example Projects, CRITERION 2, SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: The evaluation will consider specialized experience and technical competence of the proposed team relative to the primary and secondary A-E services indicated for this contract. The evaluation will place more emphasis on projects involving the Primary Services listed in the required A-E services. Projects completed by the prime A-E firm identified in Part I may be given more consideration in the evaluation process than projects of proposed subcontractors. Projects completed in the NAVFAC SW AOR may be considered more favorably in the evaluation process.

Submission Requirements:
For the proposed team, submit a minimum of five (5) and a maximum of ten (10) specific, recently completed projects that best illustrate overall team experience in the required A-E services listed above.
  



At least three (3) of the projects shall have both a minimum A-E fee of $500,000 and be self-performed by the Prime A-E firm.

In addition, address key elements for each project by describing: 1) Specific required A-E services performed by the firm; 2) Sustainable features incorporated in the project; 3) A-E Fees for the project; and 4) Percentage of work self-performed by the prime A-E firm.

If the proposed team is a joint venture (JV), information should be submitted as a joint
venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be
submitted for each joint venture partner, while ensuring you do not exceed the maximum of ten (10) projects for the proposed team.
 If a project was performed by a joint venture, and all joint venture partners are not on the team proposed for this contract, the firm should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner teaming on this contract. Likewise, if the team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration. 

SF330, Part 1, Section G, Key Personnel Participation in Example Projects: Submit in accordance with the SF 330 Instructions.
 From the total projects listed in Section F, provide a minimum of five (5) and a maximum of ten (10) projects.

CRITERION 3, CAPACITY: The evaluation will consider the Offerorâ€™s capacity to accomplish the work in the required time and the capability to self-perform at least 50% of the contract value with in-house staffing. 

Submission Requirements:
Submit a narrative that demonstrates the firmâ€™s capacity to accomplish work in the required time frames.
  Address key elements by identifying and discussing: 1) Present workload and capability to integrate work under this contract with other work; 2) Methodology the prime A-E firm will use to execute a minimum of 50% of the contract value with in-house personnel; 3) Availability of the project team (including subcontractors) for the specified contract performance period; 4) Capacity to accomplish multiple large task orders simultaneously; 5) Strategy to meet surges in unexpected workload demand.

CRITERION 4, PAST PERFORMANCE: The evaluation will consider the Offerorâ€™s past performance on relevant Government and/or commercial projects regarding quality of work, cost control, compliance with performance schedules, and customer satisfaction, with emphasis on example projects presented in Section F.
  The evaluation will be based on past performance assessments and other available past performance information.  Points of contact provided in the proposal may be contacted.  Where there is no record of past performance, the proposal will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  Superior performance ratings on relevant projects may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements:  Submit an A-E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS), Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS), or a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) evaluation for each project submitted under Criterion 2.  If a completed ACASS/CPARS evaluation is available, it shall be submitted with the completed SF330 package.
 If there is not a completed ACASS/CPARS evaluation, the PPQ included with this notice is provided for the Offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project. If a PPQ is submitted, but an official ACASS/CPARS evaluation is found for that project in government databases, the official evaluation will take precedence. If an ACASS/CPARS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.  Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF330.  If the A-E is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project before the response date set forth in this notice, the A-E should complete and submit with their response the first page of the PPQ (Attachment #1), including contract and client information for the respective projects.
  A-Es should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  If the client requests, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Governments point of contact, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest, Code RAQ20.HH, Attn: Hal Hayes, via email at harold.hayes@navy.mil, prior to the response date.  A-Es shall not incorporate by reference into their response ACASS/CPARS or PPQ evaluations previously submitted in response to other A-E services procurements.  However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation.  Submitted ACASS/CPARS and PPQ evaluations will not be counted as part of the 30 page limitation and shall be attached to the SF330, behind the SF330 Part II document(s).

CRITERION 5, LOCATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY: The evaluation will consider the teamâ€™s location, demonstrated knowledge of, and project experience within, the geographic areas where projects are anticipated for this contract.
  The preponderance of the work will be at Government installations in southern California.  Prime A-E firms with a local office in southern California may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements:
Submit a narrative that demonstrates the teamâ€™s knowledge of and project experience within the geographic locations for anticipated projects on this contract.  Include: 1) Location of the Offerorâ€™s main office and any branch offices and subcontractor offices that will be utilized for this contract; 2) Description of teamâ€™s knowledge of, and project experience within, the targeted geographic areas; and 3) Description of teamâ€™s ability to ensure timely response to requests for onsite support at Government installations throughout the NAVFAC SW AOR.
 Firms with a main office outside Southern California shall address how they would effectively communicate, collaborate, and share data with clients and subcontractors. 

CRITERION 6, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN: The evaluation will consider the Offerorâ€™s demonstrated success and knowledge in sustainable design and sustainable urbanism. 

Submission Requirements:  Describe the teamâ€™s knowledge of and experience with incorporating sustainable design features into projects. Address the use of recovered materials, renewable energy, and sustainable principles and concepts, particularly related to site design.

 Describe any projects that have been certified by the LEED program or other similar programs. 

CRITERION 7, QUALITY CONTROL: The evaluation will consider the Offerorâ€™s Quality Control (QC) program for ensuring technical accuracy of the A-E work product and effective cross-coordination among various disciplines.  Firms that demonstrate a QC process that will minimize the governmentâ€™s quality assurance (QA) effort in reviewing the A-Eâ€™s work product may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements:
Submit a narrative that describes the QC program used by the firm to ensure technical integrity of provided services.  Address key elements by identifying and describing: 1) The QC process the team uses to ensure consistent quality work across the entire team (including subcontractors); and 2) The teamâ€™s QC processes for checking documents for coordination errors, omissions, conflicts, and discrepancies in the design/report documents; tracking, and incorporating review comments.

CRITERION 8, VOLUME OF WORK: The evaluation will consider the volume of DOD work awarded to the firm in the past 12 months with the objective of equitably distributing contracts among firms, including minority-owned firms and firms without prior DOD contracts.
 
Submission Requirements:

  Joint Ventures (JV) should list awards to the JV entity and separately list awards to each individual JV member for the time period.  Do not include work performed as a Subcontractor.

SELECTION INTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS: Personal interviews may be scheduled for firms slated as most highly qualified.  Firms slated for interviews may be asked to explain or expand on information contained in the SF 330 submittal.  Please note Joint Ventures (JV) slated for interviews will be required to provide a copy of the JV Agreement prior to the interview.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: All information must be included in the SF 330 package, (cover letter, attachments and excess number of pages will be excluded from the evaluation process).
 

System for Award Management (SAM) Database:  In accordance with FAR 52.204-99, System for Award Management Registration, ensure your firm has an active SAM entity record.  SAM is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities of CCR (Central Contractor Registration), ORCA (Online Representations and Certifications Application), and EPLS (Excluded Parties List System).  SAM is the primary Government repository for current and prospective federal awardee information.  Please complete your SAM registration for the same name and address identified as the submitting office on your SF330, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.  Registration instructions and information can be accessed from the SAM home page at: https://www.sam.gov.

In accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute (formerly the Brooks Act), the A-E firm must be a registered/licensed architectural and/or engineering firm.
 Provide evidence that your firm, subcontractor or proposed team members are permitted by law to practice the profession of Architecture and/or Engineering, i.e., State registration number, a brief explanation of the firmâ€™s licensing in states that do not register firms, etc. Firms will be required to submit proof of required professional A-E registration/licensure prior to the interview phase of the selection process. This documentation is not counted as part of the 30-page limitation.

A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a completed SF330 package per the submission requirements to the office shown below.  The submittal package (original, plus 2 copies and 1 CD) shall be received in this office (NAVFAC Southwest, Attn: Harold Hayes, Code RAQ20.HH, 1220 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92132) no later than, 2:00 P.M.
 Pacific Standard Time on TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 2015.  Facsimile and emailed SF330 packages will not be accepted.  Submittals received after this date and time will not be considered. 

Read the following information carefully.
A firm risks the late receipt and rejection of their SF330 package when delivery is delayed until the last few minutes before the deadline.  Firms intending to deliver the SF330 package in-person are cautioned that the NAVFAC Southwest facility is located in downtown San Diego.  It is recommended that the firm allow for delays driving through downtown San Diego caused by traffic (both freeway and downtown), train/trolley crossings, parking at the pay lots/meters near the facility, and gaining access to a secure Government facility.
  No parking or offloading of SF330s is available at the Government facility.  SF330s shall be delivered to the mailroom in Building 128 and reasonable time shall be allowed for mailroom personnel to receive and time stamp the SF330.  The stamp time is determined by the NAVFAC Southwest facility mailroom time stamp device only, not by any other time keeping device that the proposing firm may use or own.  Immediately upon proposal delivery, the A-E firm representatives shall leave the premises of the Government facility.  A firm that does not leave the premises may be requested to leave or be escorted off the premises.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. ALL INFORMATION NEEDED TO SUBMIT SF330 DOCUMENTS IS CONTAINED HEREIN.
  NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE, TECHNICAL INFORMATION, OR BIDDER/PLAN HOLDER LIST WILL BE ISSUED.  It is the offerorâ€™s responsibility to check the NAVFAC electronic solicitation website NECO (Navy Electronic Commerce Online) at:   https://www.neco.navy.mil for any revisions to this announcement or other notices.  Plan-holder list is available via the NECO website and an Interested Vendors List is available via the FedBizOpps website, www.fbo.gov, under this solicitation number.  Address inquiries via email: harold.hayes@navy.mil or via telephone: 619-532-1251.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p><strong>Question:</strong><br />On page 34 of the RFP, Figure 10 indicates there are 8 POPs within the network with 19 more planned. On page 37 paragraph 2, the report indicates there are 8 POPs with 19 under construction and 20 more planned. Can clarification be provided regarding the number of POPs planned and under construction, as well as what involvement would be required by the offerer regarding the POPs? Are the POPs construction and operations already managed? Are they only sites for regeneration equipment? Will they be part of the assessment in terms of construction, configuration and options, power, and HVAC?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />Regarding the number of POPs in operation, construction, and planning, the Grantee has informed that these facilities are in various stages of development and that updated information will be provided to the U.S. firm upon contract award.  Additionally, further information regarding the requirements for assessment of the POPs as part of the Statewide Hybrid Broadband Network Architecture will also be provided by the Grantee upon contract award.</p>

<DESC><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in; mso-add-space: auto"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Synopsis: </span></p>
<p>NOTE: THIS AMENDMENT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). SEE BELOW FOR THE RFI DETAILS.<br /><br />&bull;1. NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>&bull;2. The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541513 which is a corresponding Size Standard of $27.5M. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar service offered to the government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming arrangements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>&bull;3. Program Details:</p>
<p>&bull;a. The Government intends to solicit and procure services for the Mission Planning Support Contract III (MPSC III). The objective of this procurement effort is to provide continued support of the Mission Planning System (MPS) which currently consists of the Unix Mission Planning System (UNIX&shy; MPS), Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS), and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). These systems are paired with platform-unique software for aircraft and precision-guided weapons to create complex Mission Planning Environments (MPEs). The MPEs define the specific hardware and software approved for use on each weapon system.</p>
<p>&bull;b. MPS sustainment support for this procurement includes the Mission Planning System Support Facility (MPSSF) which provides specialized MPS information technology and mission support services to Active and Reserve components of the Air Force, other joint commands and agencies, and 25 different allied countries. The requirement is to provide information technology services and sustainment of equipment, to include critical software and hardware maintenance, configuration management, software reproduction and distribution, technical documentation, training, and software security on over 75 different MPEs. These services span the full spectrum of mission planning support to the warfighters. The primary interface to operational units is provided via the System Support Representatives (SSRs); the on-site extensions of the MPSSF collocated with warfighters around the world. The SSRs provide mission planning systems administration (hardware and software), install software patches/updates, perform configuration control, software distribution, real time troubleshooting for aircrews, and submit discrepancy reports to the Help Desk. This procurement also includes the management, maintenance and sustainment of Mission Planning Central (MPC). MPC is a globally accessible collaboration platform utilized for all aspects of the Mission Planning Program.</p>
<p>&bull;1. It is anticipated that the effort will be awarded as a 100% Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-Aside.</p>
<p>&bull;2. Anticipated Source Selection Procedures: Performance Price Trade-Off</p>
<p>&bull;3. Anticipated Contract Types: Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Reimbursable No Fee (CRNF)</p>
<p>&bull;4. All responsible sources may submit a response which, if received in a timely manner, must be considered by the agency</p>
<p>&bull;5. The solicitation will result in one award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract</p>
<p>&bull;6. The resulting contract will have a five (5) year ordering period with a period of performance that extends one (1) year beyond the ordering period</p>
<p>&bull;7. Place of Contract Performance: Contract performance will take place in a large number of geographically diverse locations throughout the world. Currently, there are approximately 110 separate locations that require support although potential offerors are advised that the actual number of locations requiring service during performance may vary substantially.</p>
<p>&bull;8. The Government anticipates releasing the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) on or after 12 July 2016 under solicitation number FA8217-16-R-XXXX.</p>
<p>&bull;9. Estimated Award Date: 30 August 2017</p>
<p>&bull;10. The resulting contract will contain the FAR clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services.</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address:<br />6038 Aspen Avenue (Bldg 1289)</p>
<p>Hill AFB, UT 84056</p>
<p><br />Nothing in this pre-solicitation announcement shall qualify the RFP. The RFP will contain current information regarding competition, set-aside, source selection technique, evaluation factors etc. Any change to the RFO will be by amendment.</p>

Established to answer America's call for trained fighting men in the early, ominous days of World War I, Fort Jackson has always served as the Army's pioneer in the training environment. Named in honor of Major General Andrew Jackson, a native son of the Palmetto State and the seventh president of the United States, Fort Jackson, which is located in the heart of the midlands region of South Carolina, was incorporated into the city of Columbia (the City) in 1968. The Installation's primary mission is providing the Army with trained, disciplined, motivated and physically fit Soldiers who uphold the Army's core values and are focused on teamwork. Succeeding in that mission means training in excess of 36,000 basic training and 8,000 advanced individual training Soldiers every year. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Fort Jackson is home to the U.S. Army Soldier Support Institute, the U.S. Army Chaplains Center and School, and the National Center for Credibility Assessment.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Installation encompasses more than 52,000 acres of land with more than 100 ranges and field training sites and 1,160 buildings. Soldiers, civilians, retirees, and family members make up the Fort Jackson community that continues to grow in numbers and facilities. The Installation is home to more than 3,500 assigned active duty Soldiers and their 12,000 family members.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Fort Jackson employs almost 3,500 civilians and provides services to more than 46,000 retirees and their family members. An additional 10,000 students attend courses at the Soldier Support Institute, Armed Forces Chaplaincy Center, the National Center for Credibility Assessment and Drill Sergeant School annually.</span></p>

<p>On behalf of Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Systems (NAVAIR-PMA202) of Patuxent River, Maryland, we are surveying industry's capability to produce a Laser Eye Protection Threat Spectacle. <br /><br />Content of RFI Response</p>
<p>The Government invites written industry feedback on the following Draft LEP Threat Spectacles Performance Specification requirements.</p>
<p>Requirement 1:<br />Develop an LEP Threat Spectacle that meets Photopic (PLT), Scotopic(SLT) and P43 phosphor (P43) transmission requirements while also meeting the color perception (chromaticity coordinates) requirement.</p>
<p>Requirement 2:<br />The LEP Threat Spectacle shall have chromaticity coordinates in Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) 1976 Universal Color Space (as defined in CIE Calorimetry technical report 15:2004) that are located at a distance no more than 0.067 from the chromaticity coordinates of Illuminant E (u'=0.210, v'=0.474).</p>
<p>NOTE: CIE Technical Report No. CIE15:2004 is available at <br />http://www.cie.co.at/index.php/Publication</p>
<p>Requirement 3: <br />Chromaticity coordinates shall be calculated from the spectral transmission measurement in accordance with information provided in Draft Appendix&nbsp;D (attached-page 13).</p>
<p>Additional Information:</p>
<p>Specific wavelength requirements are provided below. Classified wavelength protection level requirements were made available as outlined in the FEDBIZOPPS release dated 28 May 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wavelength protection requirements:</p>
<p>The specific wavelengths and the required levels of protection OD (optical density) for self-protection are as follows: &gt;3.0 OD at 800 nm, &gt;3.5 OD at 820-870 nm, &gt;4.0OD at 900 nm and &gt;6.0 OD at 1064 nm.</p>
<p>Transmittance requirements:</p>
<p>Photopic luminous transmission.<br />Each lens of the LEP spectacle shall have no less than 50 percent photopic luminous transmittance (PLT).</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT HPCMP BOA AND TI 16 BOA SYNOPSIS
<p><br />1. The US Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville (CEHNC), is issuing this sources sought/ synopsis in order to perform market research to determine if firms possess the capability to execute the requirements of an anticipated formal solicitation for On Ramp opportunities onto an existing suite of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) for the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP), and SYNOPSIS of 2 upcoming solicitations in accordance with FAR 5.203 (d).</p>
<p>The existing BOA suite was established in June 2013 with a 5 year life cycle, expiring in June 2018. The BOA solicitation will include a Request for Proposal to become a Basic Ordering Agreement Holder based on technical qualifications, and then successful BOA holders may compete for the individual orders placed using the BOA terms and conditions. The existing CEHNC HPCMP BOAs have a total capacity of $330 Million, with a remaining capacity of $139M. This sources sought is not a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Therefore, we invite any size business concerns to provide a capability statement in response to this requirement. Additionally, CEHNC requests interested businesses to submit the attached Market Research Survey. This announcement does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any preparation costs.</p>
<p>2. At this time there are 2 anticipated BOA orders to be solicited for Technical Insertions (TI) at separate Department of Defense Facilities with-in the Continental Unites States of America, with one at the ARL DSRC and a second at the ERDC DSRC. This is a SYNOPSIS of those solicitations. The Government anticipates soliciting 2 separate requirements TI systems. The proposed system must be a balanced, commercially-available, production-grade HPC system that contains an appropriate combination of processor, memory, interconnect, disk input/output (I/O), and operating system (OS) capabilities in order to execute complex, tightly-coupled, large-scale, scientific calculations; more specifically, the system must be able to successfully execute a variety of workloads, including jobs which stress all subsystems and which require the simultaneous, tightly-coupled use of the full number of compute nodes within the system. <br /><br />3. Scope and Authority. The HPCMP is the world-class provider of high performance computing capabilities for the United States Department of Defense (DOD). CEHNC and HPCMP have formally teamed to establish a path forward for future HPCMP requirements. This sources sought announcement seeks to evaluate industry's ability to provide sustainable, state-of-the-art, HPC capability for the DOD research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E); community. This capability will be introduced through a series of (Is in direct support of the DOD HPCMP's mission - to accelerate the development and transition of advanced defense technologies into superior warfighting capabilities by exploiting and strengthening U.S. leadership in supercomputing, communications, and computational modeling. The HPCMP continues to enhance its ability to support DOD and the warfighter through the acquisition of balanced HPC systems for five (5) DOD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) and multiple Dedicated HPC Project Investments (DHPIs). The Government is interested in uncovering industry's ability to deliver balanced, commercially-available, production-grade HPC systems, which contain an appropriate combination of processor, memory, disk I/O, interconnect, and operating system (OS) capabilities in order to conduct complex, tightly-coupled, large-scale, scientific calculations.

<DESC>27 October 2015 Amendment: <br />This amendment provides the responses to several questions asked by industry.&nbsp; See attached Excel Spreadsheet. <br />Also, the Attached Cover Sheet and RFI document itself has been changed to reflect the revised submission date of 06 Nov 2015.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />**********************************<br />This is a Sources Sought Notice only; no proposals are being requested at this time. Furthermore, no draft Request for Proposals (RFP), Statement of Objectives (SOO) will be available prior to release of the solicitation.
<p>The Navy and Marine Corps Biometrics program offices are requesting information on technologies for inclusion in, or replacement of, those provided by the Identity Dominance System (IDS). This Request for Information (RFI) initiates market research under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201 for the IDS. We are interested in all potential sources, including government, commercial, and academic entities (hereinafter "vendor"). We seek information from all available vendors in support of a technology roadmap to develop and field a tactical biometric collection and matching system by fiscal year 2019 (FY19) for the Navy and FY 20 for the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or pay for the information. This RFI is solely for informational and planning purposes and the intended purpose is to conduct market research for technology refresh. This is not a Request for Quotation or a Request for Proposal, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No solicitation, statement of work, specification, or requirements package exists at this time. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation. Responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government arises as a result of submitting responses to this RFI or the Government's use of submitted information. Any information that the vendor considers proprietary or confidential business information should be clearly marked as such. Responses to this RFI that indicate that information therein is proprietary or represents confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for use by U.S. Government and support contractors as described below in Section 5.2.</p>
<p>The information provided in this RFI is notional and may change. The Government is under no obligation to revise any aspect of this RFI should any information provided herein change. The Government will provide any additional information and issues any additional request for information at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>The fundamental purpose of IDS is to provide the Navy and Marine Corps with a means to collect and process identity information in the conduct of maritime and expeditionary operations. There are three key aspects of this capability: enable forces to rapidly identify unknown individuals encountered in the conduct of operations, verify an unknown individuals claimed identity, and enable forces to update, manage, and share identity information on friendly, neutral, and enemy individuals in support of identity operations (IdOps).</p>
<p>IdOps is the synchronized application of biometrics, forensics, and identity management capabilities to establish the identity, affiliations, and authorizations of an individual, deny anonymity to the adversary, and protect our assets, facilities, and forces. As Department of Defense (DoD) biometric technology and employment matures, and as global collection of biometric samples expands, the DoD realizes an unprecedented capability to positively identify, track, and locate persons of intelligence and security interest. This ability to exploit identity information is a combat multiplier known as identity dominance , regardless of the force composition, that involves interaction with unknown individuals. Identity dominance provides a decisive asymmetric warfare capability to deny insurgents, terrorists, and criminals the anonymity and sanctuary within the general populace they require to conduct operations and avoid U.S. and coalition forces.</p>
<p>To support IdOps and achieve identity dominance for expeditionary and naval forces, the future biometrics collection and processing equipment needs to be smaller and lighter than the current system, while at the same time providing increased processing power and speed. The equipment needs to take advantage of enhanced communications capabilities and be able to store the appropriate amount of data to collect biometric samples and match the samples against an internal database.</p>
<p>All Communications shall be submitted to the following email address:&nbsp;<br /><a href="mailto:MCSC_MC3_CONTRACTS@usmc.mil">MCSC_MC3_CONTRACTS@usmc.mil</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For Full RFI requirements and submission&nbsp;insturctions please see the attached RFI-M67854-15-I-2617</p>

<DESC>NAS Patuxent River requires adequate and reliable airfield pavements, lighting, signage,and related facilities that meet Navy criteria and design standards. Runway 14-32 serve
a variety of high performance jet aircraft and large transports such as the P-8A (Boeing 737) and E-6 (Boeing 707) based and tested at the airfield.

The runway repairs will include rehabilitation of the pavements and overruns to meet current standards and to ensure another 20 to 30 years of runway service. This
runways keel is projected to have a Pavement Condition Index (PCI) of 41 in 2019 without repair and will be milled and overlayed in 2016 as required to meet airfield standards. The edge lights will be repaired concurrent with keel and shoulder repairs along with replacement conduit and handholds as required.
 The thresholds will receive
preventative maintenance and the 14 overrun will be reconstructed as needed after the demolition of the abandoned catapult #159. While the runway is out of service for repair, arresting gear slabs will be reconstructed and runway markings will be re-applied. Grading and drainage surrounding the 14-32 runway will also be repaired to correct safety concerns such as sinkholes, drainage issues, and significant erosion adjacent to the runway.

This project will include repairs to the TC-7 catapult access apron as well as repairs to the Runway 20 overrun. These facilities are located within the primary surface of 14-32 and repairs will be made concurrent with runway repairs so as to limit closures and airfield down-time.

<p>The attached LSJ provides the rationale for a sole source task order to be issued to Northrop Grumman against their GSA MAS Contract, GS-35F-4506G since they are the only source capable of providing the supplies or services required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. Northrop Grumman's e.POWER software licenses and supporting services are proprietary in nature and there are no known authorized resellers or authorized service providers available on GSA Schedule.</p>
