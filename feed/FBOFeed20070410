<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 07-03 Advanced Sighting System (One-Shot) CLOSING DATE: One year from the date of publication in www.fbo.gov; PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS DUE: 4:00 p.m., Arlington, VA local time, February 5, 2007.  POC: Deepak Varshneya, DARPA/STO; Email: BAA07-03@darpa.mil; 
Website: http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicitations/oneshot/index.htm

The proposers are advised to obtain the Proposer's Information Pamphlet (PIP) associated with BAA 07-03 and take its additional requirements into consideration when formulating their proposals.  The BAA and the PIP together constitute the full BAA for this project.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of Advanced Sighting System (One-Shot) program is to enable Snipers to accurately hit targets with the first round, under crosswind conditions, at the maximum effective range of the weapon (RE).  For this purpose, the system developed must provide a measure of downrange crosswind (wind) and range to target.  This information will then be used to compensate the bullet trajectory to offset crosswind and range related bullet deviations resulting in substantially increased success of kill.  The system must operate over a range of visibilities, atmospheric turbulence and scintillation, and environmental operating conditions and exploit novel technologies that address the overall requirements of this program.  It is anticipated that the ultimate system culminating from this investigation and development will provide performance summarized in Annex to BAA 07-03 (Classified).  The development work will be conducted in two Phases 1 and 2; with Phase 1 objective being "Feasibility Demonstration" while Phase 2 "Packaging of the System". 

It is recognized that crosswind has the effect of deviating the bullet trajectory producing offsets in the hit point.  In some cases, a 10mph wind could produce a miss even at 400 meters while in other cases the deviation could be much worse, exceeding 3 meters at 1200 meters range.  The deviation increases as the wind velocity and/or the engagement range increases.  Current methods to compensate the bullet trajectory, under adverse combat conditions, are inadequate since they require a) a spotter to guide the shooter on target by observing wind velocity and direction, b) determining the hit point deviation from the aim point if the round results in a miss, c) guessing range to target, and d) the user to undergo intense field training. 

Typically for long range shots, it is desirable to profile the downrange wind instead of measuring an average value since wind can change at various points along the range.  If the wind is profiled, it could increase the overall measurement time duration; introducing latency in measurements.  Therefore the system must be able to optimize the required accuracy in a given measurement period and the number of profiled segments over the engagement range.  Clearly, the greater the number of sampling segments, the better the anticipated hit accuracy. Topography, pressure and temperature should therefore be considered in the estimation of the number of profiled wind segments.

Although substantial efforts have been made over the last decade in measuring crosswind, two approaches have been commonly used.  These are, namely a) Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) and b) Coherent Doppler Lidar.  Although these techniques are useful for some applications, they do not seem to be adequate for this application. 

Proposers may consider any potential sensor technology, individually or in combination, or other effective sensor modalities which the Proposer considers to be technically superior or more affordable or both.  Proposers are reminded that 1) the time urgency of the need argues for mature technologies rather than immature technology requiring many years of development, and 2) end system affordability in production argues against unduly complex and expensive sensor solutions and system architectures.  

PROGRAM GOALS:

Phase 1 Goals (Base Program):  In Phase 1, the Proposer shall demonstrate the feasibility of the concept for estimating crosswind velocity, direction and range to target by modeling / simulations and validating the hit point accuracy by developing sufficient hardware to conduct field measurements.  At the end of Phase 1, the proposed approach must provide answers to the following questions: 

1.	Does the developed approach measure crosswind?  
2.	If so, can it measure crosswind to the maximum effective range of the weapon? 
3.	What is the measurement accuracy of the proposed system compared to other errors (weapon, riflescope magnification, in-line night sight, etc.)?
4.	Is down range wind profiling required?  How often?  Does one need to measure wind in other directions? If not, what?s the error?
5.	What is the maximum overall measurement time?  Does it meet the CONOPS need?
6.	Does the simulated hit point error agree with the field test data? 
7.	How accurately does the approach measure range to target?  
8.	How does it minimize clutter while ranging target?
9.	What is the minimum and maximum offset error at various ranges and wind conditions?  
10.	How is the offset error signal presented to the user (shooter or the spotter)?

Phase 2 Goals (Option 1): In Phase 2, the successful contractor shall package the crosswind measurement and compensation system into a prototype.  The Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) of One-Shot shall commensurate with battlefield operational and environmental requirements and interface with the weapon or spotting scope.  The desired system, as a minimum, will include the sensing and display elements that will be fully integrated with a riflescope (desired) or spotter's scope.  It is required that different methods and design approaches for integrating the One-Shot sensing and display technologies into the riflescope and/or spotting scope be identified, described and a plan provided to demonstrate manufacturing in volume along with cost matrix for the bill of materials (BOM). The Proposer must provide a concept design approach for packaging the various components culminating in a field deployable crosswind and range measurement system that is rugged, small, and lightweight and can operate for 100 hours on one battery charge.  

The contractor must provide the impact of integrating the proposed sensing and display system into the riflescope or the spotter scope on the battlefield concept of operation (CONOPS).  Substantial deviations from the current field operational practices are discouraged.  Minor changes that improve the efficiency and ultimately the overall performance of the mission should be described.  These eventually will be provided as part of the training resources and instruction sets, and will be part of the deliverables for this effort.  

A SECRET facility clearance and a SECRET safeguarding clearance are required to perform as a contractor under this BAA.  Organizations that do not have BOTH of these clearances may still perform under this BAA by teaming with an organization that does.
DARPA requests proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).  Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies will be considered nonresponsive to this BAA.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fbo.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal at any time up to the BAA closing date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA07-03) on or before 4:00 p.m., local Arlington, VA time, February 5, 2007.  

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or vehicle is subject to negotiation.  The government reserves the right to choose the type of contract instrument ultimately awarded.

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 Section 217 and PL 105-261 Section 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are described in the following paragraphs.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.  In descending order of importance, the proposal Evaluation Criteria includes: (a) Technical Approach and Innovations that Best Meet the program objectives; (b) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; (c) Program Schedule that Minimizes Development Risks and Offers Mature Technologies Due to the Time Urgency of the Needs; (d) Proposer's Capabilities and Related Experience; (e) Technology Transition Approach and Manufacturing Plan; and (f) Cost Reasonableness and Realism.  

In accordance with FAR 35.016(e) the primary basis for selecting proposals for award shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.  Schedule and cost reasonableness and realism shall also be considered to the extent appropriate as described herein.  Proposals may be evaluated as they are received, or they may be collected and periodically reviewed. 

NOTE: PROPOSERS ARE CAUTIONED THAT EVALUATION SCORES MAY BE LOWERED AND/OR PROPOSALS REJECTED IF SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT FOLLOWED.

SECURITY:  The Government anticipates proposals submitted under this BAA will be CLASSIFIED.  Guidance regarding the marking, packaging, and delivery of classified proposals is provided in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification and Proposers Information Pamphlet (PIP) associated with this BAA.  A SECRET facility clearance and a SECRET safeguarding clearance will be required to perform awards issued under this BAA.  (Organizations that do not have both of these clearances may still perform under this BAA by teaming with an organization that does if the organization does not receive or generate classified material.)

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional details regarding program objectives, development and integration schedule, and milestone criteria are provided in a classified addendum to the associated program BAA.  To receive the classified addendum, your organization's CAGE code must list both the facility and safeguarding clearances, as a minimum, at the SECRET level.  Proposers are advised to email their Facility Security Officer's (FSO) name, phone number, secure fax number, and classified registry mailing address, and CAGE code to Mark.Doody@darpa.mil as soon as possible, in order to receive the classified addendum in time to prepare their proposal accordingly.  The classified addendum will be sent ONLY to each organization's FSO.

DESCRIPTION
The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking proposals for new technologies for rapid, high-throughput, portable and low-cost biodosimeters to determine radiation dose to individuals after acute radiation exposure. This technology would provide rapid identification of individuals who have been exposed to high-dose radiation in order to accurately assess radiation exposure levels. 

The vision of the Radiation Biodosimetry (RaBiD) Program is to create a portable biodosimeter capable of rapid (less than 10 min) assessment of a biological sample with a goal of rapid high-throughput screening of a large population in order to correctly determine the exposure. This revolutionary detection system must be portable, low cost (less than 10 dollars/test), and able to detect and classify radioactive exposure levels within specific quartiles (0 – 100 cGy, 100 – 300 cGy, 300 – 600 cGy, greater than 600 cGy corresponding to less than LD5, LD30 – LD50, LD50 – LD70, and greater than LD70 for humans). In addition, this technology must be relatively non-invasive. The RaBiD Program will consider a wide range of biodosimetry technologies. In summary, the technology must be non- or minimally-invasive, rapid, accurate, inexpensive, and portable in order to realize the vision of the program.

All proposers to this BAA must provide evidence of a competent team capable of developing a new radiation biodosimetry technology meeting all program objectives and milestones. Successful proposals will address the program goals and specifications outlined in this BAA. For more details, a Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) is available at www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm and also on FedBizOpps and Grants.gov, and includes information on the submission process, format for white papers and full proposals, as well as dates for all deadlines. If there is any conflict, the published BAA 07-29 takes precedence over the PIP.  

PROGRAM OVERVIEW
The Radiation Biodosimetry (RaBiD) Program is a single phase, 15-month program with a goal of revolutionizing radiation exposure detection. The first 12 months consist of scientific research and development during which the proposer will develop a non- or minimally-invasive radiological biodosimeter and demonstrate accurate radiological detection from biological samples into quartiles of doses for humans (0 – 100 cGy, 100 – 300 cGy, 300 – 600 cGy, greater than 600 cGy) with a detection time less than 10 minutes. This will include radiological dose/detection curves (to validate the linearity, standard error, and range of the detector), as well as multipoint data regarding decay of biological signal as a function of time after radiation exposure.

A successful proposal will demonstrate a clear path to these deliverables, including a timeline for technology development, experimentation, and delivery of results. In addition, data describing the onset and rate of decay of the biological signal must be provided. Performers also need to demonstrate clear extrapolation between dose measured by the technology and the absorbed dose. This is important particularly if the biological signal being tested degrades rapidly and could result in an ambiguous calculation of the original dose based on elapsed time. For example, if the signal degrades, performers need to clearly show whether a measured dose of 50 cGy corresponds to a 75 cGy dose received 24 hours earlier or a 100 cGy dose received 36 hours earlier. The technology must be validated in an animal model or in patients undergoing radiation therapy during the 12-month period of research and development. 

At the end of the 12-month scientific research and development period, the technologies will undergo a down-select based upon experimental data and the ability of the technology to meet the milestones outlined in BAA 07-29. Selected technologies will have one additional month for transition and training to the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFFRI) of their prototype biodosimeter to be used in a coordinated test at AFRRI. Devices will be tested for their speed, accuracy, ease of use, and cost/sample. A successful proposal must demonstrate a plan to re-locate the biodosimeter to the AFRRI testing facility (Bethesda, MD) including expected cost for full time equivalents (FTEs) for consultation, travel, and materials during the two months of additional testing. 
 
The RaBiD Program goal of a rapid, portable, inexpensive, and accurate biodosimetry detector is an aggressive effort with an aggressive timeline. A successful proposal will thoroughly cover all details for meeting the milestones set forth for the first 12 months. At the end of the 12-month period, the team’s performance will be evaluated based on experimental data and the technology’s ability to meet the milestones. Performers that are selected to continue will be asked to teach their procedures to AFRRI scientists, either at AFRRI or at the performer's facility, to ensure proper use and maintenance of the technology. This technology is expected to be used in a forward deployment scenario, and therefore, an important consideration during testing will be portability, accuracy, and ease of use.

PROGRAM PHASES/MILESTONES 
The RaBiD Program is aimed at reducing cost and testing time while increasing throughput and portability of radiation biodosimeters. The milestones that will be used as the selection criteria for the down-select at the end of the 12 months of scientific research and development are as follows:
a. Ability to resolve irradiated animal samples or samples from patients undergoing radiation therapy into quartiles: less than 100 cGy; 100 - 300 cGy; 300 - 600 cGy; greater than 600 cGy (human equivalent dose) corresponding to less than LD5, LD5 - LD30, LD30 - LD70, and greater than LD70 for humans. 
b. 100 percent sensitivity with 95 percent confidence accuracy for determination of original exposed dose. 
c. Once sample has been obtained, ability to resolve radiation exposed dosage into one of four quartiles in 10 minutes or less. 
d. Non- or minimally-invasive: collecting blood through a finger-prick test, and collecting urine, breath, hair and toe and finger nails, as well as scanning teeth, eyes, bones, etc. are all examples of minimally invasive protocols.

DELIVERABLES
Performers will provide:
a. A radiation biodosimetry prototype technology that meets the program milestones at the end of the 12-month research and development period.
b. Quarterly reports describing progress, initial results, and analysis.
c. A final report containing all procedures, results, and analysis, including: 
1. Dose detection curves for animals irradiated at 0, LD5, LD30, LD50, LD70, and LD90. Dose detection curves will be performed out to 72 hours with frequency of data sampling performed at the discretion of the performer and relevant to the rate of decay of the signal.
2. Multi-point data curve showing decay of biological signal as a function of time after radiation exposure with multiple data points in each quartile (0 - 100, 100 - 300, 300 - 600, greater than 600 cGy, human equivalent dose). 
3. A clear method for extrapolating measured dose to the original exposed dose. 

TEAM ORGANIZATION
The aggressive goals of the RaBiD Program require that each proposal include a team with demonstrated (or established) capability. At a minimum, proposers are expected to possess expertise or demonstrate collaboration with professionals in the following areas:
a. Radiation Biologist/Radiation Oncologist--with expertise in radiation exposure to animal models.
b. Engineering--with developmental expertise needed to translate biological sampling to radiation readout.
Strong, competent team leadership is essential for successful implementation of the elements of this program. For this reason, it is critical that the research team be organized around an integration partner or Systems Integrator (SI) who has the responsibility of overall program management and who will maintain a focus on the RaBiD objectives.   

DARPA will evaluate proposals based on the composite expertise and experience of the teams, their understanding of the challenges, current data, access to facilities to conduct the proposed work, and most importantly, a clear plan to achieve the specific milestones of the program. It is left to the discretion of the proposer to construct their team from the private, academic, and commercial parties that will be necessary to achieve the milestones.  

Proposals may include, or be led by, foreign firms and/or personnel provided all export control laws and U.S. national security requirements are adhered to in the conduct of the effort and that the work relating to the foreign firm or personnel is unclassified. The onus of understanding and complying with export control rests with the proposer, not the Government.

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA. Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of BAA 07-29 will be set aside for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HBCU, and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

NOVEL MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES
In addition to radiation biodosimeter technologies, DARPA is also interested in pushing the envelope of novel radiation mitigation technologies that can be administered 12 hours or more post irradiation and provide better than 90 percent survivability to humans that would receive in excess of 200 cGy. Performers are required to demonstrate their results in an animal model. 

DARPA will accept proposals on novel radiation mitigation technologies. While still part of the overall RaBiD program, these proposals must be clearly delineated from those proposals concerning radiation biodosimetry technologies. This will be done by stating “Novel Mitigation Technologies” both at the top of the white paper and under the “Technical Area” of the full proposal as instructed in the “Submission Process” section of the PIP. White papers are encouraged and can be submitted in the area of novel radiation mitigation technologies as outlined in the “White Paper Guidelines” and “Full Proposal Process” sections of this BAA and in the “Submission Process” section of the PIP. 

Full proposals should reflect a 12-month period of performance and will not participate in further testing. Therefore, proposed costs should be calculated for a 12-month period of research and development only. 
 
WHITE PAPER GUIDELINES
It is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED that a white paper be submitted to determine the acceptability of the proposed concept to BAA 07-29. WHITE PAPERS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00PM ET, May 11, 2007.  The Government anticipates that all white papers will be reviewed no later than May 25, 2007, and recommendations for full proposals will be provided at that time. See the PIP for further details on white paper content and the submission process.

FULL PROPOSAL PROCESS
Proposals may be submitted and received at any time until the final proposal deadline of 4:00PM ET, July 9, 2007. See the PIP for further details on full proposal content and the submission process.

COST PROPOSAL
Proposals to this process for radiation biodosimetry technologies should include a cost estimate that is divided into two sections: 1) The 12 months of scientific testing, including all personnel, materials, facilities, and any other aspects of the proposed research project should be outlined, and 2) A one-month period of transition and training to AFRRI in case of selection with two months of additional testing at AFRRI.

To reiterate, cost proposals for the 12-month period of research and development will be calculated and submitted and costs for a one month period of transition and training to AFFRI and two months of additional testing as outlined in the PIP under the section: “Format and Content of Full Proposal, Volume 2,” should be submitted.

Proposals to this process for novel mitigation technologies should include a cost estimate for 12 months of scientific testing including all personnel, materials, facilities, and any other aspects of the proposed research project. There will not be a one-month period of transition or testing associated with novel mitigation technologies.

RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN USE
Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the DoD Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects. This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances. These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.
For proposals involving “greater than minimal risk” to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a Federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA. For proposals that are forecasted to involve “greater than minimal risk” after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a Federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable Federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Human Research Protections website: (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).

PROPOSAL EVALUATION 
Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. For evaluation purposes, a proposal is the document described in Proposal Format. Other supporting or background materials submitted with the proposal will be considered for the reviewer's convenience only and not considered as part of the proposal. DARPA reserves the right to request an oral presentation of proposals. If such a request is made, it is expected that, to the extent possible, all key personnel on the team will be present. The request for an oral presentation, or lack thereof, should not be construed as either a positive or negative assessment of the proposal. 

The descriptions contained in this section are to help proposers ensure that proposals have sufficiently detailed information to be evaluated. Proposals not conforming to the instructions of this section may not, at the discretion of the Government, be evaluated. Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, in descending order of importance: 

1. SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERIT
Proposers must demonstrate that their proposal is scientifically sound with feasibility for meeting the milestones. Proposers are encouraged to avoid obscure language and indeterminate measures of success as these will not help the application. 

2. VALUE TO DEFENSE
DARPA's vision is to develop technologies that will enable the Department of Defense to mount a rapid medical response to radiation events based on timely and accurate dose information of potentially affected personnel. Such a rapid, high-throughput, portable, and low-cost capability is in sharp contrast to current radiation dosimetry and biodosimetry technology that is time consuming (2-5 days), low-throughput (less than 100 samples/day), expensive (greater than 500 dollars/test), and non-portable (generally requiring a laboratory).  

3. CAPABILITY OF THE PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES TO PERFORM THE
PROPOSED EFFORT
Proposers must demonstrate that their team has the necessary background and experience to perform this project, including a radiation biologist or radiation oncologist. 

4. COST REALISM AND REASONABLENESS
Costs of the proposal must be reasonable and provide a high value to the Government. Reasonable accounting of consumable reagents, facility costs, detailed budgets from subcontractors and personnel should be provided. 

The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with proposers; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options. 

GENERAL INFORMATION
Proposals that fail to conform to the format described in the PIP may not be reviewed. Proposals MUST NOT be submitted by fax; any so sent will be disregarded. This notice, in conjunction with the BAA07-29 Federal Business Opportunity Announcement and the grants.gov posting, along with all references, constitutes the entire announcement. If there is any conflict, the published BAA 07-29 takes precedence.

No additional information is available, nor will a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded.

Only unclassified proposals will be accepted in response to this BAA.  

A website http://www.sainc.com/dsobaa/ has been set up to facilitate the submission of white papers and full proposals electronically. This site will allow submission of contact information and uploading of a white paper or full proposal in either Word or PDF format. Proposers will be able to select to submit to BAA 07-29, and must provide all contact information, as well as an abstract, in order to properly submit. Submissions may also be made by attachment to an e-mail sent to BAA07-29@darpa.mil. If submitting electronically via e-mail, the body of the e-mail AND the attachment must include the Proposer's name, mailing address, phone number, fax number, as well as the cost of the proposed work and duration (in months) of proposed work. If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information. If proposers choose to submit by U.S. Mail, they should submit one (1) original and three (3) copies of the full proposal to the address listed under the Full Proposal Submission and Deadlines section in the PIP. White papers and full proposals will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.

In all correspondence, reference BAA 07-29.

<DESC>This is a presolicitation notice for the Department of Treasury, OCC Short-Term and Long-Term Diability Insurance.  The OCC is seeking an experienced and qualified Contractor to underwrite and administer its Short-Term Disability (STD) and Long-Term Disability (LTD) Insurance Programs.  The Contractor shall administer these programs from an integrated disability management approach to ease the transition from STD to LTD.  Also, this integrated approach will aid in return to work efforts, rehabilitative employment, and early social security notice.  Currently, these programs are underwritten and administered separately by two different insurance companies.  OCC’s objective is to award only one contract to a single Contractor.

Under the OCC STD program, the weekly benefit is 60 percent of weekly earnings up to a weekly maximum benefit amount of $2,307.  There is an elimination period of seven (7) calendar days for illness or injury and the maximum benefit period is 13 weeks.  Employees are required to exhaust all of their accumulated sick leave and any leave that has been donated to them from other employees prior to receiving STD benefits.  During the period for which an employee is receiving STD benefits, the premium is waived.  

Not all OCC employees will have a need for this coverage because many of them have accrued enough paid sick leave to cover their absence during a period of short-term disability, which is the first 13 weeks of their disability.  OCC employees accrue four (4) hours of sick leave per biweekly pay period and can accumulate up to an unlimited amount.  Therefore, even though the OCC employs approximately 2,900 employees, only 1,659 employees are targeted as potential enrollees based on their sick leave balance being less than 585 hours of sick leave.  Currently, 524 employees are enrolled in the program.  The OCC hires approximately 150 to 200 employees every year and it would be expected that at least 50 percent of those newly hired employees would elect STD coverage.

Under the OCC LTD program, the elimination period is 90 days and the benefit is 60 percent of monthly earnings, up to a maximum of $10,000 a month.  The LTD benefit is offset by other income benefits (e.g. federal retirement benefits and social security benefits, etc.) and provides for a minimum monthly disability benefit of $100. 

A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL WILL BE POSTED ON/BEFORE MAY 1, 2007.

All responsible insurance carrier, please submit questions to  
Cheryl Battle by April 24.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) with Xsoptix LLC, 800 Village Walk Suite 316, Guilford CT 06437 for the purchase of two (2) Frequency Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) pulse analyzers; one at 1240 nm and the other at 1550 nm; manufactured by Southern Photonics.  Information received within 15 days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, all responsible sources may submit an offer or quotation which shall be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The NAICS code is 334519.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:  

AFRL/SNDP is working on in-house quantum dot and arbitrary waveform generation projects.  The two (2) FROG pulse analyzers will be used for these projects.  FROG systems are used to measure temporal, spectral, and phase information associated with ultra-fast laser pulses.  Southern Photonics is the only company known to build a complete FROG system meeting the current research specifications, which include hardware, software, pulse width measurements, 1550 and 1240 nm wavelengths, no alignment, fiber coupling, and computer control.  As the only known distributor of Southern Photonics' FROG pulse analyzers, Xsoptix appears to be the only responsible source since no other supply will satisfy agency requirements.

The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order.  All responsible sources may submit a quote that will be considered. The NAICS code is 541511 for this procurement.  The following is the justification for the procurement:  This requirement is for the continuity of Keyfile Software Support for sustainment of the legacy system, DDMS and to support DeCA’s 400 users both CONUS and OCONUS location for 6 months pending the delivery of DERMAS.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the Regents of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109 for a project “Statistical Genetic Analyses of Data from the SardiNIA Project”.  The contractor will perform a detailed analysis of candidate genes selected for follow-up after the first phase of the study.  This will include haplotype analysis and other analyses to evaluate the evidence for multiple independent variants in each gene; analysis of follow-up genotyping in ProgeNIA cohort.  It will also include the assessment of the results of follow-up genotyping and their comparison with initial study results; cataloguing of common copy number polymorphisms, and in particular, deletion variations in Sardinia and initial analysis of case-control studies, using ProgeNIA cohort participants who have already been genotyped as controls.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because the University of Michigan is the only source that can fulfill the requirement of this contract.  Research methods to be provide through this project include the development of program that will adapt MERLIN and other quantitative statistical programs developed by Dr. Abecasis, Univ of Michigan, to the very large and complex pedigrees in the Sardinian population, and to use a combination of low and high density single nucleotide polymorphism data to identify genetic variants that account for the genetic variance of quantitative traits and risk factors.  Dr. Abecasis is internationally recognized as a leader in the development and application of algorithms for heritability, linkage, and association analyses, including applications to “founder” (relatively less outbred) populations.   The programs he has developed have become universally used in the last several years, making him eminently qualified to apply and modify them as necessary for the study of the Sardinian population.  A survey of the literature in this field and recommendations from investigators doing related research show that there are no other sources for these services.  The period of performance is 12 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Far, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Carleton Technologies, 3018 Highway 301 North, Suite 800, Tampa, FL 33619-2226 for the acquisition of 110 each MK16 Black ABS Covers and 110 each MK16 ABS Lower Housings for the MK 16 Mod 0 Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UBA). This procurement is sole source for the following reasons. The MK 16 is a certified life support system and as such, only approved components can be used on the system. Carleton Technologies is the sole manufacturer of the MK 16 Mod 0 UBA including the lower and upper housing shells. The shells being procured will be used to replace deteriorated shells in the current inventory of MK 16 Mod 0 UBA’s. Procuring these items from another company would run the risk of incompatibility of components when assembling the MK 16. In summary, Carleton Technologies is the only source due to their unique qualifications as sole manufacturer of the MK 16 UBA. !  Use of another company to provide these items for the MK 16 would result in extensive requalifications and certifications testing which is cost and time prohibitive. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity – Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave., Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS CODE 332911 applies. Size Standard is 500 Employees. FSC is 4220.

<DESC>The outcomes to be satisfied are Base Operations Facility Support Contracting for the following specific services:  HVAC, Water, Sewer, Electrical, Gas, Steam, Building Maintenance including Minor Construction, Refuse Collection/Disposal and Recycling, Fire Alarm, Elevator, and Swimming Pool Maintenance and Housing maintenance of four flag quarters.  The outcomes are performance based. The Contractor’s performance will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  Past Performance, Management, Technical Approach/Methods, and Price.  The price evaluation will be approximately equal to the sum of the three technical performance criteria.  From a technical perspective, the criteria for evaluation will center on the offeror’s ability to perform contracts of this size and scope.  These services are currently being performed under the existing five year NOLA BOS contract, a small business set-aside with an annual FFP value of $2.7 Million and IDIQ task orders averaging $2 Million.  Historically, only in the last year have the IDIQ amounts exceeded $1 Million.  And though this contract is not exceptionally complex or of a significant dollar value, because it is a 100% competitive set-aside for HUB Zone Small Business, the Government is most interested in the offeror’s ability to manage multi-disciplines of non-technical specialties such as building maintenance and associated minor construction with technical specialties such as fire alarm and elevator maintenance.  Likewise utility management of water, sewer, and electrical distribution systems requires a specialty knowledge beyond traditional building/facility maintenance.

NAICs Code is 561210, Facility Support Services, and the business size standard is $30 Million. 

The contract performance period is for one year starting 01 OCT 07 through 30 SEP 08.  The contract will contain options for two (2) additional one-year performance periods, to be exercised at the Government’s discretion.  Options are not guaranteed.

The minimum guarantee will be the Firm Fixed Price (FFP) portion of the work.  Additional work may be ordered under the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Line items at the prices established at the beginning of the contract.

The maximum value of the contract, and the price upon which it will be evaluated, will be the sum of the FFP and IDIQ work for the base and both option periods.

The procurement will be competitive negotiated proposals (not sealed bid) amongst HUBZone small businesses.  This is a 100% set-aside for HUBZone Small Business but it is recognized that Refuse Collection/Disposal and Recycling may have to be subcontracted to a large business.

The government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.

The current and potential risks for this contract are no more than for a typical small BOS type contract.  The only foreseeable Schedule and Performance risks are those associated with premature closure of the New Orleans Naval Support Activity.  This would be an out year decision and the government would most likely try to coincide any shutdowns with the federal fiscal year ending periods (30 SEP) to minimize need for any partial termination of services during contract performance.  This contract will not contain any incentive award provisions, fee, or periods.

The Incumbent Contractor is Satellite Services, Inc., 309 S. Front St., Marquette, MI  49855. The Contract Number is N62467-01-D-6660. The Award Date was 01 Oct 2001. The Period of Performance Expires 30 Sep 2007.  The Total Estimated Value through five years of contract performance to include FFP and IDIQ was $20,984,434.90

The solicitation will be posted to The Navy’s ESOL Site http://esol.navfac.navy.mil under the solicitation number N69450-07-R-0077.  It will not be available for downloading until April 25, 2007.  The solicitation will not be provided in hard copy.  All interested firms must enter, register, and download the documents through ESOL.  Once the solicitation is available it will direct you to the location and time for a site visit along with points of contact for the solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to award a sole-source, fixed-price Purchase Order for technical support for professional services to: North Carolina State University 2406 Williams Hall Raleigh, NC 27695 This simplified acquisition is being performed in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), Soliciting Competition, for the acquisition of services to perform Interactions Among Elevated CO2, Elevated N Deposition, and Mycorrhizal Mediated N Uptake by Vegetation for EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD).  North Carolina State University (NCSU) has an on-going program evaluating the impacts of mutliple and interacting air pollutants and climate/meteorological factors.  The services required for this procurement build upon NCSU?s established program activities and calls for the use of their specialized laboratory facilities.   Additionally, NCSU employs several uniquely trained mycologists who have specialized experience evaluating the impacts of multiple-air pollutants.  Because NCSU has conducted previous work that serves as a foundation for the services required for this procurement, possess the facilities required to perform the required services, and have specially trained individuals to complete the work, contracting with any other outside firm, school, or other business would not be practicable or in the best interest of economy and efficiency.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to the Contract Specialist for this action, Jessica Gosnell, at gosnell.jessica@epa.gov no later than 04/20/07. A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government for this requirement.   The Statement of Work (SOW) outlining the services to be performed can be found below: Statement of Work NCEA Technical Support Services INTRODUCTION Approximately 2.8 trillion grams of nitrogen (N) are released into the atmosphere each year in the form of various nitric oxides as a by product of human activities within the U.S. Worldwide 60% of newly fixed N is delivered to Earth?s surfaces via human-derived sources.  Atmospheric deposition is a major source of nitrogen to terrestrial ecosystems, comprising upwards of 30% of the entire nitrogen budget in many watersheds.  Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen also contributes to nutrient loading and eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems when nitrogen runoff from land increases.  Mycorrhizal fungi help retain nitrogen within ecosystems, delivering up to 86% of the total N budget for a plant and contributing to the recovery of up to 69% of applied N.  Global climate change scenarios predict atmospheric concentration of CO2 to continue rising thus causing an increase in C-fixation for many plant species.   The NCEA-RTP office is currently seeking to retain the professional services of scientists to conduct and investigation on the effects of elevated N and elevated CO2 on arbuscular mycorrhizal mediated uptake of nitrogen. Work derived from this contract will provide unique information on how elevated levels of N deposition caused by NOx air pollution affect the nutrient uptake and cycling by terrestrial vegetation (CWA, Section 104). Section 103 (a) (1) of the Clean Air Act authorizes the Administrator to conduct, and promote the coordination and acceleration of research, investigations, experiments, demonstrations, surveys, and studies relating to the causes, effects (including health and welfare effects), extent, prevention, and control of air pollution. Moreover, Title I, Section 112 (m) (1) (C, D, and E) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 provide statutory authority to conduct this research.  SPECIFIC TASKS 	The Contractor shall accomplish the following tasks and shall complete these tasks according to the estimated time schedule given below.  Because of the importance of these tasks to EPA?s mandated environmental objectives, any late deliverables may negatively affect the outcome of the entire project. Task 1.  	Joint Quality Management/Quality Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP) 	The Contractor shall submit a Joint Quality Management / Quality Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP) for the product specified below in Task 2 within 15 days of award of the contract (see Attachment 2 for an outline of the JQM/QAPP).  The JQM/QAPP shall address issues of quality assurance and quality control procedures.  The JQM/QAPP must be approved by the EPA Project Officer and Quality Assurance Officer prior to initiation of other work. Task 2.	 Conduct Research 	The Contractor shall conduct research investigating the combined effects of elevated carbon dioxide, N deposition on potted vegetation in an indoor controlled environmental facility which allows manipulation of light and Carbon dioxide (e.g a Phytotron).  The plant species should be a C4 grass currently under consideration for development for commercialized biofuel production.  Experimental design and treatment variables 	The experimental design will be fully factorial to test the effects of CO2 (ambient and 1.5x atmospheric levels), Nitrogen Fertilization (ambient, ~+10 kg/ha, ~+35 kg/ha), and the presence of mycorrhizae on response variables that evaluate plant growth and mycorrhizal growth (Table 1). Table 1: Treatment variables and approximate values for the fully factorial experimental design Ambient Carbon Dioxide (~380 ppm)	Elevated Carbon Dioxide (~570 ppm) N1: ~Ambient	N2:  ~ +10 kg/ha	N3:  ~+35 kg/ha	N1: ~Ambient	N2:  ~ +10 kg/ha	N3:  ~+35 kg/ha +myc	-myc	+myc	-myc	+myc	-myc	+	-	+	-	+	- The Contractor will develop the arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculums for this experiment.  The taxonomic identity of the inoculums shall be identified to the level of genus.  The N fertilizer shall be composed of chemical species which closely approximate those found in the wet or dry deposition resulting from NOx air pollution.  Fertilizer application shall occur throughout the experimental period and be carefully recorded.  Light regime shall be calculated to approximate spring/ or summer conditions in units of integrated Photon Flux Density (PFD).

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT SYNOPSIS.  For the past 34 years, the EPA has purchased approximately 90% of the research animals utilized by the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) under an indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract from Charles River Laboratories.  The animals are required for the conduct of a long-range series of short- and long-term research studies on health effects of a wide range of pollutants under varying conditions.  This effort will be procured on a sole-source basis from Charles River Laboratories. The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Approximately 80% of these studies are of a continuing or comparative nature, and will require additional animals of the same genetic background in order to produce data that are reliable, reproducible, and viable over time and place. The NHEERL research data have been published in peer-reviewed journals and used to set EPA regulatory standards.  It is critical that future research be conducted with rodent models whose genetic constitutions are well defined, stable, and as unvarying as possible to avoid a negative impact to historical-data reliability.   All commercial suppliers of research animals maintain specific strains or substrains of laboratory rodents as separate, closed breeding colonies.  Primarily through spontaneous mutations or genetic drift, these strains or substrains develop a unique genetic composition that will differ from the same strain or substrain from a different supplier. Differences in genetic composition can introduce study variability that can negatively impact study results, conflict with previous results, and challenge interpretations of a large body of published data. The Agency has concluded (and numerous studies have demonstrated) that where inter-comparability of data is required from one study to another, it is necessary to use a common source of supply to eliminate extraneous variables.  Use of animals from a supplier other than Charles River would introduce such genetic, microbiological, and virological variables which would invalidate the research data base and make comparability of data scientifically impossible.  For these reasons, the Agency has decided to solicit Charles River Laboratories on a non-competitive basis for the majority of its laboratory animal requirements.   Approximately nineteen types of animals of various sexes, ages, weights, etc., will be purchased, including Long Evans Rats; CD IGS Rats; Wistar Rats; CDF Rats; Sprague-Dawley Rats; Fisher F-344 Rats; WKY Rats; SHR Rats, Brown Norway Rats; Stroke Prone SHR/SP Rats; F-344/N SASCO Rats; CD-1 Mice; BALB/c Mice; C57 BL/6 Mice; C3H Mice; B6C3F1 Mice; New Zealand White Rabbits; LVG Golden Syrian Hamsters; and, Hartley Guinea Pigs.   The primary basis for limiting competition is the Agency's conclusion that there is substantial evidence that animals that are not identical genetically, virologically, and bacteriologically to animals previously used in our research introduce unquantifiable variables into the research protocol and that such variables cast unavoidable doubt on the significance of variations on research results.  That element of doubt is of such concern to EPA that it would require a definitive and conclusive demonstration of the error of the conclusion before opening this solicitation for competition.   It is anticipated that the contract will be a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type of contract.  The contract will have a base period of 12 months with four 12-month options.  Anyone wishing to request reconsideration of the Justification for a non-competitive procurement must provide such a demonstration to the Agency within 15 days of this Notice.  Any such information submitted will be evaluated according to its conclusiveness.

The purpose of this acquisition is to analyze the domestic agricultural industry as a source of feedstock material for alternative fuels production.   The contractor will prepare a journal-quality paper describing analysis of agricultural impacts of the renewable fuel standard, and model large volume scenarios of renewable transportation fuels from the U.S. agriculture sector.  The contractor will also benchmark greenhouse gas emissions estimates  from the agricultural sector. Dr. Bruce McCarl and his colleagues at the Department of Agricultural Economics, Texas A&M University, are uniquely qualified to provide this analysis because they are the only organization within the field of agricultural sector modeling to have Texas A&M's Forestry  and Agricultural Optimization Model + Greenhouse Gases (FASOM-GHG).  They are also the only organization to have the expertise to analyze the economic welfare and GHG emissions/carbon sequestration responses of competing renewable fuels policy options.  Dr. McCarl's expertise and the FASOM-GHG  model are unique because they are linked to many of the critical production and demand factors and the relationships of the agricultural sector for renewable fuels have been incorporated and refined within the FASOM-GHG model. This is not a request for quotation.  No contract will awarded on the  basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquires and concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. EPA, Stacey Wolejko (3803R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460, or to facsimile number (202) 565-2560, or sent by email to wolejko.stacey@epa.gov.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Mohamed Nabil, Minister's Advisor, Ministry of Transport, Government of Egypt, El Nasr Road, Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt, Phone: +(202)-262-8880, Fax:  +(202)-262-8880  Email:  mnabil@mot.gov.eg.  Egypt: Railway Traffic Management System. The Grantee, Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt, acting through the Ministry of Transport (MoT) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance related to the development of a Railway Traffic Management System for the Egyptian National Railways (ENR).  The Technical Assistance would identify the best traffic management solution for ENR and would design a Traffic Management Master Plan for its implementation.  The Technical Assistance would also assist with the creation of an independent railway safety oversight and enforcement authority to monitor ENR's compliance with safe operating practices.

Railway safety and security have become immediate concerns of the MoT as a result of the recent passenger train car crash outside Cairo that caused dozens of casualties and hundreds of injuries in September 2006.  This latest accident was the third one that year and it has highlighted the country's urgent need to upgrade its safety and security infrastructure throughout the national railway system in order to minimize the risk of future accidents.  As part of its response to these terrible accidents, the Government of Egypt (GoE) pledged to invest $873 million to address problems in the ENR and received another $600 million in loans.  Additionally, a development plan for ENR has been discussed between the GoE and the World Bank.  It is scheduled to be applied between 2007 and 2008 and will be funded by a $720 million World Bank loan.  
Egypt has the world's second oldest railway system after Great Britain.  The entire system includes more than 5,000 km of track lines, but only 15% of the lines utilize electrified signaling systems.  The rest rely on manual signaling, which is both outdated and ineffective.  The railway system relies upon 700 locomotives, 75 % of which are more than 25 years old.  For a system that carries 1.5 million passengers a day and 12 million tons of freight each year, it is clearly in need of significant improvements.

A key finding of the MoT and ENR officials during the course of their post-accident investigations was that a critical component of ENR's signaling system was not working properly.  During five different tests the signaling system, which is more than 25 years old, failed to indicate when trains were required to stop or slow down.  Additionally, Egypt does not have a National Railway System Safety Plan, nor an independent regulatory body (like the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Railroad Administration) responsible for monitoring compliance with safe operating practices and enforcing safety regulations, up to and including shutting down the railway.  Additionally, ENR does not have a comprehensive traffic management system to optimize the safe movement of trains across the ENR network.  The lack of a system-wide traffic management system also prevents the attainment of business objectives, such as on time arrival and departure of trains and the minimization of fuel expenses and other operating costs.   

The Terms of Reference for this Technical Assistance includes the following tasks:

Task 1:		Data Gathering and Analysis
Task 2:		Design an ENR Traffic Management Solution and Action Plan
Task 3:		Site Visits and Public Information Strategy
Task 4:		Analysis of Current Traffic Management Safety Policy and Practices in the 
Egyptian Railway Sector
Task 5:		Design Traffic Management Components of ENR Safety Program and 
Independent Oversight and Enforcement Agency
Task 6:		Master Traffic Management Plan
Task 7:		Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment
Task 8:		Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $600,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

How are we to isolate each condenser water tie-in point? There does not appear to be any valves in the main pipe lines to and from the mechanical chiller building to the cooling tower yard or in the yard for each tower. Answer #1: Refer to keynote 7 on sheet H3.&#160; There are existing valves currently at these locations. Question #2   Bid Item 002 Deductive Alternate 1 - states work to be accomplished for that item not deducted.  The title leads one to believe that the price stated for the work will be deducted from the Base Bid is this correct? (example: the contractor writes down Bid Item 001 Base Bid for $1,000,000 and Bid Item 002 for $200,000. Is the $200,000 going to be deducted from the $1,000,000 if the deduct is elected, to give the contractor a total of $800,000 to do the project for Bid Item 002 OR should it be bid as Bid Item 001 $1,000,000 and Bid Item 002 is $800,000 and if Bid Item 002 is elected the contractor receives $800,000.) Answer #2: The base bid, Bid Item 001 is for all four towers.  Bid Item 002, Deduct Alternate is for Two towers. It will be awarded based upon funding by the VA.  Question #3  Can we get a copy of the sign in sheet for the pre-bid. Answer #3: Sign Sheet was posted with Amendment #1.  Question #4 - Can 36" header be welded w/20" Weld-o-lets on branches? Answer #4: Yes. Question #5 - Please advise mfg and model of pumps being furnished by the VA.  Answer #5:  Information was posted with Amendment #2.  Question #6 - The 12" balancing flume line between towers shown on drawing 1-H5 schematic show isolation valves.  Where are they required if only towers CT-3 and CT-4 in phase I are accepted.  Answer #6: Provide the connection point so the line can be extended in the future. Question #7 - Are triple duty valves and suction diffusers w/strainers acceptable in place of that shown on drawing 1-H3 and 1-H4? Answer #7: Multi function valves are acceptable per specification 15705.&#160; Suction diffusers with strainers are acceptable&#160; as long as manufacturer confirms the NPSHr of the pump is achieved. Question #8 - We would like to know the local Siemans Reps phone number fax and billing address so we can insure that they are ready.  Answer #8:  We are not able to provide this information.

A capability for indexing and searching against digitized results is required. Responses should clearly indicate hardware and software requirements, staffing projections, estimated schedules, and costs for both a pilot and a full implementation. A solicitation may be issued to all firms that are found responsive to the requirements of this synopsis. All requests from responsive vendors will be fully considered.

<DESC>The following questions and answers are provided: Q1.  Although you have given the required square footage for all of the structures, we believe that it is important to have the dimensions of each tent as it will be pertinent to the area in which you wish to install these tents.  For instance:  I have looked at a previous or current installation at the Statue of Liberty from satellite photography and it appears that the existing structure is 40' wide.  Based on your required square footage of 3,680, I can conclude that this particular structure is 40' x 92'.  I believe that the dimensions of this tent are integral to the design and function. A1.  Tent Specifications  MIO  Dimensions: 10'x15'         Apertures: 1 4'x8' high roll up vinyl door 	Battery Park  	Dimensions: 50'x100' custom fabricated aluminum box beam screening tent  	Apertures:  2 single doors, 2 double doors 	Dimensions: 20'x100' custom fabricated aluminum box beam holding tent 	Apertures:  1 single door, 1 double door 	Liberty State Park  	Dimensions:  32'x50' custom fabricated aluminum box beam screening tent  	Apertures: 2 double doors   	Dimensions: 32'x65' custom fabricated aluminum box beam holding tent  	Apertures:  1 Double Door, 2 single doors 	Liberty Island 	Dimensions:  32' x 132' custom fabricated aluminum box beam holding/concession tent  	Apertures:  2 double doors, 1 single door  	Dimensions:  32' x 50' custom fabricated aluminum box beam screening tent  	Apertures: 2 double doors  Q2.  Will you require any flooring or carpeting in these tents?  If so, will you require the tent vendor to provide it? A2.  Flooring is used at times as needed.  Flooring will be required on a case by case basis as it relates to NPS security and visitor service concerns.  Carpeting is not required.    Q3.  How many sets of doors will you require in each tent? A3.  See "apertures" in answer #1  Q4.  Will the tents require installed lighting?  If so, will you require the tent vendor to provide it? A4.  The tents currently have lighting and HVAC.  We will require lighting and HVAC as appropriate for the size and use of the space.  The current tent vendor provides HVAC and lighting.   Q5.  Tent installation will require us to drive several 36" metal stakes into the ground/surface.  If stakes cannot be driven, large concrete or water barrels will be required to anchor the structures.  The latter is a more expensive proposition.  Can you be specific as to which method(s) of installation you will require at each tent?  A5.  Stakes are not allowed.  the tents need to be anchored by above ground means (water barrels, sand bags, etc.)   Q6.  I am assuming you will need electrical distribution in each tent to power lighting, security scanners, etc...   Will it be part of this contract, or a separate RFP?  If part of this contract, will you require the use of portable generators? A6.  Portable Generators are currently provided by the tent vendor.  We require that the space have the lighting and HVAC appropriate for the amount of space and use.     The due date for expressions of interest in the project remains April 27, 2007.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
The Executive Office for United States of Attorney?s (EOUSA) on behalf of the United States Attorney?s Office Western District of North Carolina (Charlotte) invites contractors to submit a proposal for services described in the attached statement of work, under the authority of Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Enclosed you will find a Statement of Work for Grand Jury and Deposition Court Reporting Services.  Please submit your price and technical proposal by April 20, 2007 at 11:00 a.m. (EST).  This RFP in no way obligates the U.S. Government to award a contract, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in preparing and submitting your proposal. 

The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on key personnel, organizational past performance, organizational experience, and price.  Under a Best Value source selection, non-price evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.

EOUSA intends to make multiple awards under this solicitation.  The Proposals MUST include the following information:

(1) Provide resumes of prospective personnel. The personnel will be the person expected to perform the tasks identified in the Scope of Work. The resume should reflect the personnel?s security clearance level, training and certifications, if any.

(2) Provide up to three (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, up to three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The Government reserves the right to check other references not provided by the Contractor.  The following information is required for each reference:
		
			(A)  Customer name and address
		(B)  Point of contact (name, telephone number) for contractual/administrative matters and technical performance.
			(C)  Period of contract performance
			(D)  Description of work performed
	
(3)  A summary of the Contractor?s experience demonstrating the contractor?s knowledge and ability to perform the duties and tasks reflected in the Scope of Work. This summary shall not exceed two (2) pages.
	
(4)  Price quote as reflected in Section B.

This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set Aside.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 561492.  In order to be considered a small business under this NAICS code, your average annual receipts must not exceed $6.5 million.  

The Government estimated value of this contract is $300,000.00 for one base year and four 12 month option years.  The precise period of performance will be determined at the time of award.

<DESC>Questions and Answers:

 
1.
Q.  Will the Image Knowledge Base software be used solely for post-committal data extraction from image and integration with the eDib architecture or does SSA desire a fully integrated Enterprise Content Management solution to include content/document management, workflow, and records management capabilities in addition to post-committal data extraction from image? 

A.   The Image Knowledge Base software will be used for post-committal data extraction.  SSA already has a content management system and the Image Knowledge Base software will need to interface with the existing system.

 
2.
Q.  If only post-committal data extraction is desired for this project, will the Image Knowledge Base solution interface with an existing Enterprise Content Management solution at SSA and if so, which solution product? 

A.  SSA is using IBM’s Content Manager Family as its Content/Document/Record Management solution.

<ARCHDATE>04092008
<CONTACT>STACEY DIAMOND CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487309     sdiamond@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) continuously monitors for earthquake activity in the United States, through a national network and regional networks of seismometers of various types.  Collectively these integrated networks are called the Advanced National Seismic System, or ANSS.  The data collected ("waveforms") are archived for multiple purposes: 1) as federal records; 2) for use in retrospective studies by USGS, such as hazard mapping, modeling and calibration; 3) for use by researchers, including for USGS-supported external research and research funded by other federal agencies.  It is important that these data are carefully archived and readily retrievable through a sophisticated search engine.  Over the past year, the USGS has worked with experts from partner educational institutions to develop a set of requirements for an ANSS waveform archive (ANSS ARCHIVE REQUIREMENTS link can be found at  http://www.usgs.gov/contracts/docs/ANSS/ANSS.pdf).  The purposes of this Request for Information (RFI) are to identify potential providers of an archive service and to obtain additional information and questions from those potential providers. The USGS now seeks information on industry capabilities, products, services and potential sources. At a minimum, the USGS requires the following information: 1) Your proposed technical capabilities, capacity to perform, proposed schedules with milestones, and your comments and questions about the ANSS waveform archive requirements.   2) An overview of your experience in the field (data achiving, seismological data, etc.). Please provide corporate experience as well as personnel qualifications in the areas listed above and as specified in the ANSS ARCHIVE REQUIREMENTS link above. 3) Explain how you would ensure the security and integrity of the archive. 4) Provide answers to the following questions/issues and any other comments/questions you may have regarding the RFI.  Are you interested in competing for this requirement? If so, would you be proposing as a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor? Are you a Small Business? If so, what is your small business status, e.g. 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, etc? If you propose, would your company partner with other companies? Do you have similar experience in seismological or geophysical or related data management?  If so, describe your experience.  Please summarize any suggested technical and management approach to solve this problem that the Government should consider.  Please identify the areas of significant cost in regards to the requirements document. What factors in the requirements most influence cost? More information regrading the ANSS and the Global Seismographic Network can be found at the following :  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/monitoring/anss/ and  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/monitoring/gsn.php Vendors are encouraged to forward any questions in writing to Stacey C. Diamond, Contracting Officer (CO), at sdiamond@usgs.gov by 2:00pm, EST, May 7, 2007. Vendors are required to word questions in such a way that the entire question can be publicized without concerns of releasing confidential or proprietary information. Questions and answers may be publicly posted to a USGS web page established for this RFI. Vendors will be notified through a modification to this synopsis.  Written submissions can be e-mailed to the CO by COB May 8, 2007 and please annotate the subject line of e-mail responses as: RFC-07HQ19-NoSolicitation. Your responses may be used in market research for a potential acquisition and responses thereto, or lack thereof, will not constitute a commitment by USGS to treat any potential offeror more or less favorably in any anticipated forthcoming solicitation and/or ultimate award.  DISCLAIMER: THE RFI IS ISSUED SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) 15.201(e), RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT. RESPONDENTS ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO THIS RFI. RESPONDENTS NEEDING CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT FOR ANY PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THEY FURNISH MUST COMPLY WITH THE USGS's CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REGULATIONS, 17 C.F.R. 200.83 (CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROCEDURES UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT). RESPONSES TO THIS RFI WILL NOT BE RETURNED. RESPONDENTS WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULT OF THE REVIEW.

<DESC>Description: The government is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) as part of the modernization of range training to increase Military Operations in Urban Terrain ( MOUT) training; Stability and Support Operations (SASO) ; Basic Urban Skills Training (BUST); and, training operational  effectiveness at Marine Corps Installations from east of the Mississippi River to the Atlantic coast.  PMTRASYS plans to acquire MOUT training systems as a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) acquisition.  The MOUT Training systems will range in size and complexity based on installation requirements.  MOUT training systems will allow for non-live fire training using MILES and SESAMS technology and live fire training using 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 9mm and/or .50cal ball ammunition.  Training systems will accommodate individual and small units up to battalion size incorporating foot, mobile, mechanized and/or armor patrols up to and through the sites.  Operations will be conducted both day and night!  .  All training systems shall be removable and relocatable and not interpreted as fixed construction.   Part of this effort will require the successful offeror to partner in an Integrated Product Team (IPT) identifying and documenting physical solutions to Government requirements concurrent (real time using commercially available ADP software) with delivery order development.  Product designs will be capable of withstanding wind loads and seismic considerations based on the International Building Code (IBC) and compliance with OSHA safety standards.  Professional engineering will be required for erosion control or storm water permitting; requisite ventilation requirements for enclosed live fire structures and HVAC requirements as appropriate within training structures; and  electrical design supporting site power from generator source as well as requisite electrical power for component structures comprising the training system.  It is desired that offerors have recent (5 year) experience in sniper tower or MOUT development, installation and emplacement of MOUT trainers and be !  capable to execute on approved delivery orders within 90 days of contract award.  O&M data to include an as-built drawing set shall be produced for each completed MOUT training system.  As-built data will be certified by a registered/ professional engineer in the state where the trainer is located prior to submission to the Government.   As part of a future solicitation, the Marine Corps System Command, Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS) will release a DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT Systems Requirements Document for industry comment within 30 days of the release of this announcement.  Vendors will be asked to supply comments to the documents indicating ability to meet specified requirements; specific items requiring clarification for responsive industry proposals; and, specific requirements which the vendor feels will un-necessarily drive system procurement or lifecycle cost.  Comments received from vendors will be considered by the Government for basis of modification to the subject documents.  Comments will not be directly responded to but may be addressed collectively at a future date during or prior to solicitation.  This request for comment in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the US Government for information or materials provided. It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. All information provided becomes USMC property and will not be returned. All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately. Submissions are due on or before close of business May 10, 2007. Submissions received after this date may or may not be reviewed.

<CONTACT>MR. DENNIS BALL, 812-854-2129
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopcom.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. This market survey is intended to obtain information on a commercially available/non-developmental item for the next generation MK49 MOD0 Gun Weapon System also known as the Remote Operated Small Arms Mount (ROSAM) system.  The current ROSAM system includes the following components: stabilized remote controlled weapons mount, a means for video auto-tracking, weapons interface medium which at a minimum can support either a MK19 40mm Grenade Launcher or a  M2HB .50 caliber Machine Gun, control station, external cabling, and on-mount sensor(s) suite capable for both day and night operations.  Critical characteristics of the ROSAM are that the weapon station is no more than 350 pounds without weapons and ammunition, able to function with a minimum of a 200 pound applied load at the gun location, fit on a standard Navy weapons tripod or equivalent stand, has a slew rate of at least 50 degrees per second in elevation and azimuth, with a minimum elevation movement range of 80 degre!  es and minimum azimuth range of 359 degrees.  The system has a pointing accuracy not greater than 6 milliradians, operates from a single 24 VDC 30 amp source, and uses standard industry message traffic communications such as RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 or Ethernet based protocols. Video from the system is NTSC format and capable of producing both raw and aiming overlays video signals.   The new MK49 MOD1 system must perform as well or better than the existing MOD 0 configuration within the same maritime environment as described above.  The main difference expected of the MOD1 system is that the normal operating station can be removed so that the weapon station/weapon can be controlled via a standardized operator console like the Navy’s AN/UYQ-70 Command and Decision Console.  In order to accomplish this, the Government will develop its own operator user interface using contractor furnished software interface control documentation.  This system will be used mainly with the Navy’s Shipboard Protection System program, but may be used as stand alone systems similar to the current MOD 0 systems.   This RFI is open to both domestic and foreign sources of supply. Responses are required to include the firm name, mailing address, telephone and facsimile numbers, World Wide Web (Internet) presence (if any), size of firm, number of years performing related work and direct points of contact including e-mail addresses.  Technical information documenting functional characteristics and test data to collaborate said characteristics should accompany any responses.  Only written responses transmitted electronically, or by mail will be accepted.  Electronically submitted responses on CD are preferred.  Material being forwarded for this request can be sent to the following: dennis.ball@navy.mil. Responses to this announcement should be received NO LATER THAN 10 May 2007.  Respondents can send CD’s and other data to:  Commanding Officer, NSWC Crane Division, Code 0562NC, Bldg 2521, 300 Hwy. 361, Crane, IN  47522, ATTN:  Mr. Dennis J. Ball.  This sources sought announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  All information will be considered.  This is not an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Government will not provide payment for any information provided in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government return any data provided.  All data will be for official Government use only.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.

FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division and United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) are contemplating the use of the foreign comparative test (FCT) program to test, evaluate, qualify, and procure a commercially available Programmable-High Explosive Dual Purpose (P-HEDP) 40mm ammunition.  The Government intends to procure under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT), with NAMMO A/S, Raufoss, Norway for comparative testing of a commercially available, improved 40mm P-HEDP round (NAMMO HEDP-PRO) with armor-penetrating capability in addition to air-burst capability.  However, any interested party may submit a white paper.  The primary application for the P-HEDP rounds is for the Advanced Lightweight Grenade Launcher (ALGL) MK47 MOD 0 40mm machine gun.  The proposed P-HEDP project will test and evaluate products from two previous FCT projects.  This project will combine the warhead from the Improve!  d High Velocity HEDP (I-HV-HEDP) M430 project designed to interface with the NICO Pyrotechnic screw-on propulsion system and the MK438 fuze from the ALGL Pre-fragmented Programmable High Explosive (PPHE) MK285 air-bursting 40mm cartridge.  It is envisioned that this combination will form the P-HEDP cartridge and will provide tangible performance benefits of armor penetration capability equivalent to M430 HEDP and will project larger fragments with increased air-burst lethality than smaller MK285 fragments.   It should be noted that during the evaluation of all information submitted, the government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) as advisors to the Government evaluators.  All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  This synopsis is for informational and planning purposes only, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be contacted regarding their submission or information gathered as a result of this notice.  Respondents will not be notified about the outcome of the Government’s review of the solicited information.  Failure to respond to this sources sought synopsis will not limit a potential offeror’s ability to respond to a solicitation at a later date.  This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposals, and !  is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  The Government will not provide payment for any information provided in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government return any data provided.  All data will be for official Government use only.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.   No solicitation exists at this time.

<DESC>GOVERNMENT SOURCES SOUGHT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for Diver Thermal Protection Systems, Components, Technologies, or Concepts. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No award shall be made as a result of this announcement.  NSWC Panama City on behalf of the Program Management Ships Naval Special Warfare (PMS-NSW) is seeking information on diver thermal protection systems, individual components, or technologies for use by swimmers using SCUBA, rebreathers, or during wet submersible vehicle transit. This RFI is seeking information on both heating and/or cooling technologies. Both passive and active technologies are of interest. This notice serves as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting research efforts. NSWC PC and PMS-NSW are interested in systems, components, or technologies that will improve the operational capabilities and/or effectiveness of NSW divers during cold water and/or hot water operations. Ultimately, these technologies must suppor!  t these missions by improving diver capabilities in at least one of the following areas: 1) Increase mission duration due to maintaining normal body core and/or extremity temperature longer than current systems allow 2) Allow greater maneuverability while in the swimming mode 3) Increase diver comfort 4) Integrate with existing systems better than what is in current use 5) Be less expensive to purchase and/or maintain 6) Be more compact, portable, durable, or lower maintenance.  This RFI addresses four major areas: 1) Passive diver heating 2) Active diver heating 3) Passive diver cooling 4) Active diver cooling.  Interested parties must provide paper submittals, to be received by the Government by May 9, 2007. The Government will assess submittals for their potential use in NSW diver missions. Submittals that the Government determines to possess potential for improving NSW divers’ performance in challenging thermal environments may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate !  their system, subsystem, or concept.  The government does not anticipa te providing funds to Contractors to participate in any demonstrations. Prior to any demonstration, the government may wish to conduct unmanned testing on the subsystem/system to verify performance.  There is no specific format or outline that submittals must follow.  Information pertinent to system or subsystem technical maturity, potential effectiveness, performance, suitability, cost and schedule should be provided. Include other descriptive literature and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance consideration and evaluation of the information submitted. Contractors responding should indicate whether they are a small business (S), a small disadvantaged business (SDB), 8(a), or large business (L). Please include two (2) copies of each response. Each response must reference the RFI title and must be limited in length to ten (10) typed pages. Specific narrative information that should be provided in the submission include: (1) System description, capab!  ilities (2) Chronology of system development (3) If applicable, a summary of past test events with location, dates and results (4) If available, logistic supportability and projected unit cost estimate information (5) In anticipation of Contractor invitation for a limited scope demonstration, provide an explanation of what would be demonstrated and any additional support required of the government necessary for the Contractors participation in the demonstration. Supporting literature and test documentation that demonstrate technical maturity of your proposed solution may be included in addition to the 10-page narrative paper. Contractors offered an opportunity to demonstrate their system will be provided additional details including demonstration schedule and extent of support the Government will provide. Telephone responses will not be honored. Technical Questions and responses to this announcement should be directed to Ms. Jody Wood-Putnam, e-mail: Jody.wood-putnam@navy.m!  il

Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.
D. Evaluation Criteria
The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.
Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability.  After review of the technical criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.
The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTF). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A deadline will be specified to vendors for the arrival of the shipment to the MTFs. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Clinical factors will be weighted more heavily than price. All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors who fail to offer discounted prices could be excluded from RIA award consideration.
The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one to five where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.1 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.1 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 
After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.1 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region.  Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume agreement for a two-year period with (3) three possible one-year option periods (not to exceed a total of 5 years).  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  In addition to the required discounted pricing from DAPA for participating regional commands, vendors should also submit additional tier pricing in the event that they are afforded added volume from standardization commitments from other regions.  However, alternate (tiered) pricing proposals will not be evaluated as part of the selection.

<SUBJECT>R -- Develop an interactive prevention matrix
<DESC>This is not a solicitation and therefore proposals are not requested.  This is a notice of intent to procure services as described below on a sole-source basis.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) works to prevent violence before it begins (primary prevention).  Prevention requires understanding the factors that influence violence. CDC uses a four-level, social-ecological model (i.e. Prevention Matrix) to better understand violence and the effect of potential prevention strategies. The Prevention Matrix takes into consideration the complex interplay between individual, relationship, community and societal factors. It allows the factors that put people at risk for experiencing or perpetrating violence to be analyzed.

A well coordinated set of tools explaining the concept of primary prevention and the principles that accompany it does not currently exist.  Accordingly, DVP has a requirement for the development of an interactive, computerized version of the Prevention Matrix, a tool that helps explain primary prevention and the social-ecological model to DVP grantees and partners.  

CDC intends to purchase the development services from Banyan Communications, Inc. (Banyan) which is the only known responsible source capable of satisfying the requirement to develop the interactive computerized version of the Prevention Matrix using educational theory (Heuristic Engagement).  Banyan will use its proprietary software development tool called THEO, a trade marked educational platform developed by Banyan, to develop the interactive computerized version of the Prevention Matrix.  THEO uses proven educational theory (Heuristic Engagement).  No other source offers THEO.   

The statutory authority for this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 25, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responses shall be submitted via email to Mr. Lionel Nadeau at: lnadeau@cdc.gov

EPA's Recovered Materials Advisory Notice (RMAN) recommends recycled content levels for purchasing park benches and picnic tables as shown in the table below.
EPA's Recommended Recovered Materials Content Levels 
for Park Benches and Picnic Tables:

Product	Postconsumer Content(%)	Total Recovered Materials (Content %)
Plastics	90-100	100
Plastic composites	50-100	100
Aluminum	25	25
Steel	16
67	25-30
100


EPA's recommendations do not preclude a procuring agent from purchasing park benches and picnic tables made from other materials. They simply require that procuring agencies, when purchasing park benches or picnic tables made from plastic, aluminum, concrete, or steel, purchase these items made from recovered materials when these items meet applicable specifications and performance requirements. 

"Plastics" includes both single and mixed plastic resins. Park benches and picnic tables made with recovered plastics may also contain other recovered materials such as sawdust, wood, or fiberglass. The percentage of these materials contained in the product would also count toward the recovered materials content level of the item. 
The recommended recovered materials content levels for steel in this table reflect the fact that the designated items can be made from steel manufactured in either a Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) or an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). Steel from the BOF process contains 25-30% total recovered materials, of which 16% is post consumer steel. Steel from the EAF process contains a total of 100% recovered steel, of which 67% is post consumer. 

Installation consists of receiving, delivery from DFAS dock to cafeteria, setup including leveling, and trash removal. Any defective parts received will not be accepted and replaced within a reasonable time. All purchases are non taxable.


4.0  Invoicing Information:  Invoices shall be submitted to the COR/GPOC (Acceptor) as a 2-in-1 or Combo invoice via the internet using the Government provided Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) Receiving/Acceptance System at https://wawf.eb.mil.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the opportunity to develop and provide a software package designed to support collaborative, online interactions before, during, and after conferences in support of NASA work*.  The first use of this software package will be at the Participatory Exploration Summit at NASA Ames Research Center tentatively scheduled for June 22, 2007.   The software will be developed as a module for an open source Content Management System (CMS) and after this conference the software package will be released to the open source community.  The functionality of the software will potentially be extended to support exclusive project development groups supporting NASA-related activities.   Successful collaborations between NASA and the external community will often be catalyzed through live conference participation, but will also require a significant amount of online participation.  In order to facilitate these new partnerships between NASA and other entities, Partnership Software will be required for innovative online collaboration, before, during, and after a conference. It will leverage new "Web 2.0" online tools, which include collaborative technologies such as wikis that allow users to collaboratively create and edit content on websites.  This envisioned software will enable groups to initiate discussion before an offline conference event and enhance the capture and publication of content created at an offline conference event.   In accordance with the mission of NASA’s Innovative Partnerships Program, Partnership Software will foster unique joint ventures with the entrepreneurial community in support of NASA’s goals.   NASA Ames proposes to acquire a Partnership Software package, as described below, to facilitate conferences and subsequent projects, including those in support of innovative endeavors like NASA CoLab.  The first demonstration of this technology will be at the proposed Participatory Exploration Summit in June 2007.   After the first demonstrated use of this Partnership Software, the software package will be released to the open source community.  There will then be the option of extending the baseline software development contract and expanding the functionality of the software package to support project development groups in association with NASA, subject to availability of funding.  The Project Facilitation Tool will extend the baseline conference software and facilitate project incubation and implementation, and allow discussions to flow into idea and concept development, eventually leading to project team formation and finally resulting in concrete fundable project proposals and even rapid early stage vetting and execution of certain projects.	 Once extended in this fashion, the envisioned software would support a full “life-cycle” of supporting online communities of practice that maximize the value derived from investments in offline conference events:  it will enable groups to initiate discussion before an offline conference event, enhance the capturing and publishing of content created at an offline conference event, and will support the formation of team and ongoing work by these teams on projects that are catalyzed by the conference event. DELIVERABLES:  (1) PES website live by June 1, 2007 and conference event support.  The organization selected to develop and provide the Partnership Software will provide technical support of a specified amount of hours prior to the event, during the event, and after the event. Prior to the PES, the organization developing the software will work with the PES organizers to ensure the core functionality of the conference website as detailed in the Appendix.  For the first demonstration of the Partnership Software at the PES, the organization selected to develop the Partnership Software will provide support live at the event, on June 22, 2007.  After the PES, the organization that developed the software will ensure full functionality of the conference website, as detailed in the Appendix.  (2)	Package software for open source community.  Package the software within an active open source software community including extensive documentation of the code, and a step by step installation and configuration guide and instructions for effective use by end users who are not programmers. ESTIMATED TIMELINE:   Proposals Due:	April 24, 2007 Proposal Selection Panel Review:  May 1, 2007 Contractor Selection Announced:  May 4, 2007 Beta of Website and Conference Tool completed:	May 25, 2007 Launch Website:  June 1, 2007 First Demonstration of Partnership Software Package, at the Participatory Exploration Summit at NASA Ames:  June 22, 2007 Partnership Software released to open source community:  June 30, 2007 *SEE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF WORK FOR FULL DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.     (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

New Performance Decision Date:  June 6, 2007


The Contracting Officer is Michael Knowles, Phone 202-482-6437, Fax 202-482-4988, email, mknowles@doc.gov.
 Working Capitol Fund is what private interest groups or individuals make their checks payable to when requesting Photographic Services. We do provide services upon request to FTC and FMC. The services are the same as the requesting offices in the Department of Commerce. They range from Official Portraits in the studio and on location, Award Ceremonies, and photojournalism with proofs and enlargements provided upon request.

b.	Will the PS provider continue to provide services to non-government private interest groups such as the Credit Union and National Marine Science Foundation?

ANSWER.Yes, they will continue to provide services.

6)	How will photographic services be billed/payment for services be processed?

ANSWER.Photographic service will be billed monthly invoices and payments made based on the Firm Fixed-Price.

7)	To who is photographic work to be delivered: OPA, the customer, both?

ANSWER.The photographic work is to be delivered to both.

8)	How will we receive requests for photographic services (fax, call, email)?
 ANSWER.The request for photographic service will be issued by an approving official, by all forms of electronic means.

Performance Requirements
9)	3rd bullet re: photographs for the website:  
a.	Some assignments may be completed on weekends and late in the evenings.  Will the government consider revising the standard to 2 business hours?   
ANSWER.Yes, this is reflected in the Final Performance Work Statement.  
b.	Also, who will determine which photographs will be posted to the website, and when in the course of an assignment will we be advised of this?

ANSWER.The customer will determine which photographs will be posted to the website.  The photographic service provider will be advised of this when requesting the service.

10)	4th bullet re: All other photographs provided within 8 business hours of completion of assignment.  
a.	Some assignments may be completed on weekends and late in the evening, and some assignments may be very lengthy and cover several days. The longer the assignment, the greater the number of photographs.   In addition, industry best practices provide for color correction, red eye reduction, cropping, eye opening, and general cleaning up of photographs in preparing a proof CD for the customer, which takes time.  For enlargements (prints), commercial services charge 200% mark-up for same day services; 100% for next day services, and require 3-5 business days for standard turn-around services.  Will the government consider a 3-5 business day turnaround for standard orders, unless the customer specifies faster turnaround and understands the additional cost to the customer? 
ANSWER.Yes, the Government will consider 3-5 day turnaround for standard orders, unless the customer specifies a faster turnaround time. 
b.	Please define ??all other forms of photographs.?? Does this refer to proof CDs, or enlargements (prints)?  Does this mean photographs that are not for the website, and if so, what types of photographs does the government anticipate this would be (e.g. certain portraits, certain types of events, etc.)?
ANSWER.Proofs, enlargement, portraits, and CDs. 

11)	5th bullet re: quality. Is the photographer responsible for ensuring proper protocol, such as the relationship of the flag to the subject ?V or is this a customer responsibility?
ANSWER.The PS provider shall provide all photographic work to the customer as requested by the customer with an electronic copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative.
12)	Currently, the NAICS Code is: 921190 ?V Other General Government Support.  Wouldn??t it be more appropriate listed under NAICS Code 541922 ?V Commercial Photography?
ANSWER.Yes, the NAICS Code has been changed from 921190 ?V Other General Government Support to reflect the more appropriate NAICS Code 541922 ?V Commercial Photography.
13)	Rather than a ??Total Small Business Set-Aside??, could a set-aside for ??Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business?? be of more value to the Department of Commerce??s SDVOSB goal?
ANSWER.After careful consideration and further research, the Department of Commerce has determined to remain with a ??Total Small Business Set-Aside??.  
14)	Since employees of a winning-contractor would be subject to the DOL Service Contract Act, which of course directly affects the dollar amount of our bid, could the final solicitation include the GS grades of the 4 incumbents?
ANSWER.The GS grades will not be reflected in the posted solicitation.  
15)	Will the Solicitation include a clause that Incumbent employees have the right of first refusal?
ANSWER.Yes, the clause is, and will be inserted into the Solicitation that Incumbent employees will have the right of first refusal.

The exhibit in the 5400 corridor is usually updated with the change in administration.

The new department heads generally want their agency to reflect the most recent changes made.  ITA has several exhibit areas and conference rooms.

BIS is similar to ITA, but their people and subject matter does not change.

?X	Research support for periodicals/publications:  Once a quarter.  Market research support can take from several minutes to several days depending on what is needed and the timeframe it is needed in.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 7

UNITED STATES POSTING OF AN AMENDMENT TO SOLICITATION SA13017RP0007   This is an amended Solicitation Notice for an OMB Circular A-76. Revised, May 2003. Public-Private Competition to provide Commercial Photography performed with the Office of Public Affairs located in Washington, D.C. Please reference OMB Circular A-76 Page B-5, Paragraph 2 - Time Limit.

erce website sent to the webmaster and or customer within two business hours of the completion of the assignment.  OPA will work with photographic services on which photos shall be posted to the website.?  Delete PWS Performance Requirements Bullet Number 4 ?Digital photos and CDs with photos for the website shall be sent to the customer within two business hours of completion of the assignment.?


11.  According to professional standards of photography, editing, red eye correction, color correction, cropping, and general cleanup of photographs is necessary before the digital photos are saved in low-resolution format to a CD to be delivered to the customer for posting to a website, or the further selection of images to be printed.  Therefore, if the government expects these standard professional practices from these deliverables, a two-hour window from the time an assignment is completed to delivery of the CD with photographs is not realistic.  (Even more so in cases when an assignment is off-site and produces hundreds of photographs, or there are several assignments in one day).  

Would the government be willing to change the requirement to a 1-2 business day turnaround?

ANSWER:  We specify that photos other than those for the website (proofs, enlargements, portraits, CDs) shall be provided within 3-5 business days after the completion of the assignment.


12. CONCERN: Alternately, is the government willing to accept un-edited and un-retouched photographs that do not adhere to professional standards?  Note that for the latter option, the web-master and each customer would need to acquire the appropriate software and hardware to be able to properly view high-resolution photographs, since there would not be time to create low-resolution photographs.  

ANSWER:  NO.

13.  Also, will the above requirements include images from outside entities, i.e. photographs taken by outside photographers during the Secretary?s international travels?

ANSWER:  Currently, photos for international travel are contracted out through the embassy or Foreign Commercial Service.  The Service Provider will not be responsible for this.


14.	Re: Attachment B/Constraints, bullet 9 defines market research and provides instructions as to locating a professional photographer.  Could the government clarify or define which General Requirement or Performance Requirement that this Constraint refers to?

15.	Re: Attachment B/GFP, the government lists ?Camera, still picture? as one of the pieces of furnished property.  Does this refer to one camera or multiple cameras?  Does it refer to still (film) cameras of various formats and/or digital cameras and lenses, flash equipment and other accessories? 

ANSWER:  Please refer to the ANSWER to Question Number 20.

ANSWER:  There are no previous contracts.  All applicable standard sizes and any volume based discounts should be included based on the Performance Work Statement in Amendment One Attachment B and the Workload Data in Amendment One Attachment C.  

4.	Re: RFP/Evaluation Method/Factor 1 states, ?Performance Requirements Summary for a phase-in and phase-out plan.?  Does the government require a PRS only for phase-in and phase-out plan, or for the whole performance period, including phase-in and phase-out?

ANSWER:  The Performance Requirements Summary will be required for a Phase-In, Phase-Out, and for the performance period of the contract.

5.	Re: RFP/Evaluation Method/Factor 1 says, ?The Government will utilize the Performance Requirements Summary to incorporate a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan after award.?  Does this mean that no Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan is required as part of the service provider bid?

ANSWER:  No Quality Surveillance Assurance Plan is required as part of the service provider bid.

6.	Re: RFP/Provisions/Factor 1/Technical approach states, ?Technical approach shall not exceed two pages shall not exceed two pages each.?  We understand this to mean that each of the following requirements has a separate two-page limit: the Cost Reduction Plan, Transition Management Plan, and Performance Requirements Summary plan.  Is this correct? 
ANSWER:  Yes, this is correct.

7.	Re: Attachment A/Response to Questions, question 2b.  The government answered that the provider is not required to travel.  However, to calculate workload on preparation performed for travel, providers need an estimate of number of trips they will be required to provide advance market research for.  

ANSWER:  The number of times that would be contracted out for a photographer would average at the most once per month, probably less.  Currently, OPA press staff takes photos when the Secretary travels.  For international trips, photographers are obtained through the embassy.

8.  Re: Attachment B/General Requirements, bullet 3: ?Provide photography-related services such as providing reprints and enlargements, editing/color correcting services, and creating master photo CDs.?  Could the government provide workload data so that providers can have a basis on which to calculate costs for retouching, reprints, enlargements, etc.?   

ANSWER:  Workload Data has been provided on Amendment One Attachment C of the Solicitation.  This is a performance based fixed price contract.

9.  Alternatively, it may be more appropriate to consider additional CLINS for a la carte (reimbursable) pricing off a rate sheet for these services?

ANSWER:  Workload Data has been provided on Amendment One Attachment C of the Solicitation.  This is a performance based fixed price contract.

10.	This question refers to two requirements.   Re: Attachment B/Performance Requirements, bullet 3 states that DOC photographs for the website ?must be electronically sent to the webmaster within two hours of assignment completion.?  Bullet 4 then states that ?Digital photos and CDs with photos for the website shall be provided to the customer within two business hours of completion of the assignment.? 

ANSWER:  Corrected PWS Performance Requirements Bullet Number 3 is changed to read as follows:  ?Photographs for the Department of Comm
