<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, Morgantown, WV, Health Affects Lab Division, Allergy and Clinical Immunology Branch in support of the Computational Biology Team requires professional services for the Configurational Entropy in Receptor-Ligand Binding: The MIE-NN Method.</p>
<p>I. Background<br />Modern biomedical research recognizes the critical role of computational studies in biology, molecular medicine, and toxicology. The goal of the Computational Biology Team is focused on the calculation of the thermodynamic concept of entropy for molecular systems involved in binding smaller ligands to receptors located on larger macromolecular systems. Specifically, the contribution of rotation about intramolecular bonds and the constraint of associated energetics of those bonds with binding of ligands is the focus of the Configurational Entropy Project.<br />The mission of the Computational Biology Team is focused on modeling and quantitatively estimating entropy using the fundamental and well established theories of statistical mechanics. In collaboration with the Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology (CARB) at the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, the Team has successfully identified a tractable method to deal with the most challenging aspect of modeling the energetics of binding-the configurational entropy.1 It combines the theory of mutual information expansion (MIE) originally identified by CARB investigators2 with the non-parametric methods of nearest neighbor (NN) estimation of entropy identified by the Team.3 It is called the MIE-NN method. This appears to be a novel method with far reaching implications in the fields of chemical toxicity characterization and of drug design. Initial successes in simple molecular systems are being validated in more realistic systems, and expanded to include effects of solvation and ion binding.<br />II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract<br />1. Implement software needed to estimate configurational entropy with the MIE-NN method, allowing for calculations in large systems with several hundred variables. Due to the sheer physical size of computer files used and the number of variables analyzed for such large systems (e.g. cyclodextrin and ER&#61537;), an enormous burden is placed on computer resources to read and edit these files. It is necessary to develop software procedures to provide an accurate, efficient, and robust solution to this demand. The hardware and software systems must allow for several MIE calculations to be run concurrently, and results of these calculations to subsequently undergo a process of concatenation/compilation to achieve final configurational entropy estimates.</p>
<p>In addition, the computational system must allow ongoing calculations to be stopped and then restarted due to unexpected events (e.g. prolonged power failure, system updates that require rebooting, etc.) or software upgrades that provide significant increases in efficiency. All these factors may result in the output being significantly fragmented but salvageable. In order to avoid possible human error in the concatenation/compilation process, it must be highly automated to obtain final MIE NN based entropy estimations.<br />2. As a specific extension of previous collaborations with CARB, a protein structure that meets NIOSH mission needs has been identified. This addresses the need to develop the MIE-NN approach in a biologically natural receptor-ligand system. It is the estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#61537;) protein. This system will meet needs to have a computationally tractable model to elucidate important methodological issues still inherent to validating the MIE-NN approach; and it will contribute significantly to practical needs to estimate binding affinities for molecular systems with potential toxicities.</p>
<p>There are significant concerns about the challenges of applying the MIE-NN methodology to the ER&#61537; free receptor because of its high degree of flexibility and multiple conformations. The existing crystal structures of ER&#61537; will be used with a variety of different ligands as starting points for the simulations to compute entropies. Initial focus will be on differences among binding entropies of different ligands. Since the entropy of the free ER receptor cancels perfectly in these relative binding entropies, it will not be necessary to simulate the free ER receptor in order to gain valuable insights into the role of configurational entropy in the differential binding of a variety of ligands.<br />This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, Reference 000HCCCB-2009-63892, CDC NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or e-mail to RMULLENAX@CDC.GOV or FAX to 304-285-6083. Phone 304-285-5880. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with the University of Maryland, Biotechnology Institute, 701 East Pratt Street, Suite 200, Baltimore, MD 21202-3101 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>Appraisals for Properties Enrolled in USDA, NRCS Easement Programs in NH, VT & ME

This is a pre-solicitation notice by the Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, VT State Office, to obtain appraisal services for acquisition of conservation easements on behalf of the United States of America, acting by and through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine.  The conservation easements will be for wetlands and other conservation practices in accordance with the Wetlands Reserve Program and other Farm Bill programs.  The contractor shall furnish all appraisal services according to USPAP guidelines.

For planning purposes, there are expected to be approximately 30 appraisals to be completed in each contract year.   The solicitation will be divided into zones for proposal and order purposes.  Respondents may offer on any or all zones.  It is estimated that between five (5) and thirty (30) appraisals per year may be needed.  The minimum order guaranteed by the government is one appraisal per contract awarded.  Total delivery orders issued against each contract for all years can not exceed $500,000.  The contractor will also be asked to submit pricing for time-sensitive delivery of services (less than 20 day turn-around) in addition to regular pricing.  

The NRCS intends to award an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) fixed-price contract to a small business source capable of providing real estate appraisals for a base period of one year and four option years for a total of approximately five years. An IDIQ fixes a price for an appraisal, should it be ordered.  There is a guaranteed minimum of one appraisal per contract for the base year and no guaranteed minimum for the option periods.  It is anticipated that more than one contract may be awarded from the solicitation.  

The contractor is responsible for having a current knowledge of the requirements of state law in connection with real estate transactions and appraisals.  Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser or obtain a state temporary practice permit and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued. Appraisers must demonstrate competency in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) in conducting appraisals of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type. All appraisals completed for this program shall comply with USPAP and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.

This is 100% set-aside for small-business. The associated NAICS code is 531320 and the small business size standard is $1.5 million in average annual receipts.

All contractors must register in the Central Contractors Registration database at www.ccr.gov. The CCR Customer Assistance Center can be contacted toll free at: 1-888-227-2423. The first step to registering is to obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, which is a unique nine-character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun and Bradstreet (D&B). To request a DUNS number, call D&B at the toll free number 1-866-705-5711 or register on-line at http://www.dnb.com/ccr/register.html. Obtaining a DUNS number through this process is free of charge. Its a good idea for anyone who is submitting a proposal to begin this process as soon as possible since it can take several days to complete. Failure to register by close of business on the third day after notification of possible award by the Contracting Officer, may cause rejection of your offer. Prospective contractors also must complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. (see FAR 4.1102) Prospective contractors shall update the representations and certifications submitted to ORCA as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete.

All prospective contractors will be required to review all documents pertinent to the solicitation.  All offerors that meet the qualifications in the attached Appraisal Specification will be considered for award.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror(s) based on price.  Since award will be based on initial responses, offerors are encouraged to offer the most advantageous pricing in their response.  

The solicitation package and all attachments will be posted to this website on or about 15 days from issuance of this notice.  Responses will be due approximately 30 days after issuance of the solicitation.

	Have the ability to act as a Prime Contractor and provide a total system solution through the life cycle of the program
	Ability to access, receive, and store classified materials, and conduct classified work, at the SECRET NOFORN and up to TS/SCI classification levels 

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 

The EP-X program is anticipated to become an ACAT-1D program at Milestone A and will develop a flexible, responsive, manned Multi-mission, Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT), ISR&T aircraft capable of carrying expendables.  Intelligence and sensor capabilities will include Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) (such as Electro-Optical/Infrared Intelligence), and Radar Intelligence (RADINT) (such as Synthetic Aperture Radar, Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar, and Maritime Moving Target Indicator).  The ability to perform on or off-board sensor control, onboard processing and Multi-INT data fusion, will enable the EP-X to operate successfully in either communications permissive or communications constrained environments.  

The EP-X will be capable of worldwide self-deployment.  Specific EP-X capabilities will include timely and accurate intelligence collection; threat detection; target acquisition, tracking and identification; and accurate geolocation of mobile and fixed targets in all environments.  In its role as an ISR&T system, the EP-X will provide real-time Intelligence Preparation of the Environment (IPE), Indications and Warnings (I&W), Anti-Surface unit Warfare (ASuW) targeting support, Direct Threat Warning (DTW), and Information Operations (IO).  The EP-X system will allow dynamic tasking/re-tasking by command elements, making the system highly adaptable to changing situations.  

The EP-X program will include all elements of the system life cycle, including requirements analysis and allocation, system design and development, test and evaluation, production, product support, and training.

<DESC>Rental of a HAKI Trak Roof System for use at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  Brand Name Mandatory.  POP 12/1/2008 - 8/28/2009.
The proposed requirement is to rent a Haki Trak 750 temporary roof system and to procure additional sheets of the roofing system for use on the SSN700, which will cover the entire boat.  ThyssenKrupp Safway, Inc. has been the only company that provided a quote for a temporary roof that met the specifications.  It is the only roof that has a temporary sheeting, that can be rolled back in sections to open up specific areas of the enclosure to allow movement of materials in and out by crane.   The Haki roof section is rolled back from either side by a worker standing on a platform.  This takes only a few minutes to accomplish.  All other temporary roofing systems that have removable sections require several workers to get on top of the enclosure to disassemble and reassemble the roof.  This takes much longer and proposes a safety hazard.   The use of the Haki Trak 750 temporary roof system saves many manhours and dollars, as well as providing a safer work environment  This temp! orary roof system is used to provide an enclosure for drydock #1 to protect the ships and workers from exposure to the weather.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Upon issuance of the Request for Proposals, the JPM-Decon DFoS Program Office will request proposals for decontaminants with chemical and biological efficacy (may be addressed by separate products) comparable or superior to existing decontaminants (i.e. HTH, STB, DF-200), have a reduced logistical burden (decreased decontaminant weight, transportation and/or storage restrictions, shelf life issues, etc.), and compatibility with current applicator systems (i.e. JSTDS-SS) and common military materials (i.e. CARC, IPE, metals, plastic, and rubber).  To reduce the logistics footprint associated with a bulk liquid decontaminant, the decontaminant will be in the form of a liquid concentrate and/or dry powder(s) that is water soluble.  It is desired the decontaminant require no special mixing device and have minimal transportation/storage restrictions.  DFoS is interested in decontaminants that are currently available for delivery. <BR><BR>Proposed decontaminants will be compared against the following criteria:<BR>*  Chemical Efficacy: GD, HD, VX  99% reduction within 30 minutes<BR>*  Biological efficacy following 30 minute decontaminant exposure: <BR>	- Biological Endospore and Vegetative Bacteria - No Colony Forming Units (CFU)<BR>	- Viruses - No Plaque Forming Units (PFU)<BR>*  Warfighter logistics burden in comparison to existing decontaminants (i.e. HTH, STB, DF200)<BR>*  Compatibility with the JSTDS-SS applicator module<BR>This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract.

The contract amount for the base period and any option will not exceed $1,500,000 for each period, unless an option period is exercised early and unused capacity is rolled over to the next contract period. The total contract amount shall not exceed $4,500,000. Individual task orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount. The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government. At the discretion of the Government, the option years may be exercised early if the Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted. If the option is exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the contract award date, or the anniversary of exercising an option, the new option year rates will take effect on the anniversary date of the contract period. If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that years 12-month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimate Price of the option period being exercised. At the discretion of the Government, if an option year is exercised early and unused capacity is rolled over, the Government may extend the period of service to coincide with the anniversary date of that period. The minimum guarantee for the base year of the contract will be $30,000.00.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employees office location (not the location of the work). Firms should indicate personnel and subcontractors selected to work on the contract and state their management structure. To be eligible for contract award, a firm or joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the Internet Site at http://www.ccr.gov/, or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334.3414 and complete annual representations and certifications at https://orca.bpn.gov. Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement. For A-E contracts awarded at or above $30,000, the USACE will evaluate contractor performance and prepare a performance report using the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), which is now a web-based system. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days. Accessing and using ACASS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the users computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transactions. The certification software could cost approximately $110-$125 per certificate per year and is purchased from an External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendor. Current information about the PKI certification process and for contacting vendors can be found on the web site: http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil. If the Contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to ACASS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor. The Secretary of the Army Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) requirement will be incorporated into the anticipated contract. The annual CMR requirement will apply to each task order which is funded by Army dollars; supports an Army mission; which benefits or supports any Army military, civilian, or contractor personnel; or when the Army is the executive agency for the mission being supported. The A-E will be allowed to include their costs for compliance with the CMR requirement as a line item in their price proposal for each task order subject to the CMR requirement. Further information is available at https://cmra.army.mil.<BR>The contractor shall be responsible for designs and drawings using computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), per the A/E/C CADD Standard (see https://tsc.wes.army.mil/products), and delivering the two or three-dimensional drawings in the AutoDesk AutoCAD software release 2004 or later.

<p>BARDA is seeking responses from qualified small business sources only (e.g., small business,&nbsp;8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Veteran-Owned, and Service Disabled Veteran Small Businesses).&nbsp; Responses from large businesses will not be reviewed under this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>*** BACKGROUND *** The National Pandemic Influenza Plan (Nov. 1, 2005) designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness. Following the issuance of this plan, the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) was charged with gathering information, developing policies and issuing recommendations on specific medical countermeasures may be used to contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with an influenza pandemic in the U.S. The office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is responsible for the tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these countermeasures, including the establishment of a stockpile of supplies to prevent or control the spread of pandemic influenza disease. This is a&nbsp;Sources Sought Notice seeking small businesses&nbsp;with the interest and capabilities to perform certain testing of vaccine components in the BARDA pandemic preparedness stockpile. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.
<p><br />*** OBJECTIVE *** As part of its preparations, HHS/ASPR/BARDA has established a stockpile of avian influenza vaccine antigens to be administered in a pandemic or pre-pandemic situation for the prevention of avian influenza disease. In order to extend the number of effective doses that can be provided from the stockpile, BARDA is also working with manufacturers to develop antigen-sparing technologies such as components that can be added to the vaccine to enhance its immune response, known as adjuvants. In the event of a pandemic emergency, HHS would like to be able to extend the available stockpile of antigens by administering them with adjuvants depending on availability. In order to have this ability, BARDA, in conjunction with NIH, CDC, and the antigen and adjuvant manufacturers, is planning to conduct clinical testing of possible antigen:adjuvant combinations, the results of which would be submitted to U.S. regulatory agencies as support for an Emergency Use Authorization. Evaluation of these investigational formulations will be made by serological testing for immunogenicity by appropriate assays for influenza vaccines. BARDA seeks qualified, small business contract research organizations having the necessary capabilities and willingness to conduct this testing. This is a request for such organizations to make themselves known to BARDA and provide information concerning their capabilities to perform the testing. Please provide information concerning the following required capabilities.</p>
<p>1. Conducting immunological testing of sera from human clinical trials</p>
<p>2. Assessment of sera for the presence of antibodies reactive with influenza antigens by Inhibition of Hemagglutination (HAI) and Microneutralization (MN) assays, using reagents specific for the vaccine (homologous) or other (heterologous) influenza strains.</p>
<p><br />3. Must possess the necessary facilities, capabilities, and expertise to conduct GLP human serology analysis in compliance with all applicable codes and regulations.</p>
<p>4. Capacity for up to 10,000 samples for the duration of the testing</p>
<p>5. Availability to start in January 09-June 09 timeframe</p>
<p>6. Both HAI and MN assays must be fully qualified (recognized by FDA) for testing human clinical trial samples. Also, both HAI and MN assays must be qualified for at least one pandemic flu strain for testing human sera from clinical trials</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Data obtained from this sources sought notice will be used by HHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness.</p>
<p>All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant Federal law and will be eligible for additional special protections under the conditions of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program outlined in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002.</p>
<p>Information must be submitted by 9:30 a.m. (EST) on November 10, 2008. Include the name, email address and telephone number of a primary contact point at your organization for this sources sought in the event that HHS has additional questions or requires clarification on the submitted information. Responses are limited to 2 pages.</p>
<p>All questions and your responses to this sources sought notice must be submitted electronically in Adobe Acrobat&nbsp;(.pdf) or Microsoft Word&nbsp;format and emailed to kevin.nilles@hhs.gov. The type of business submitting the response (i.e., small business, hub-zone, small and disadvantaged business, etc.) must be identified in your response. If the service can be acquired on a GSA schedule, VA schedule, or other Government-wide acquisition vehicle, please supply the contract title and number, contract point of contact information and the name of the awarding agency.</p>

Description:  This notice is a Sources Sought announcement.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The JM&L Contracting Center in support of the Project Manager Soldier Weapons, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for fabrication and delivery of M249 Feedbox Support Improvement Kits (Government Technical Data Package Part Number 13020583).   The M249 Feedbox Support Improvement Kit (FSIK) is to be manufactured, inspected, assembled, packaged and shipped in accordance with the Government TDP.  The M249 FSIK is composed of metal alloy parts that attach to the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon reinforcing the dovetail support on the weapon.  This dovetail support provides the attachment mechanism for either a 100 or 200 round ammunition magazine that feeds the weapon.  This reinforcing Kit provides additional support to the weapon dovetail and prevents unintended release of the ammunition magazine due to rough handling due combat operations. This notice is to determine if there are sources capable of manufacturing the M249 FSIK for a potential base quantity of 16,850 with four (4) additional ordering periods for a potential maximum total of 58,700.  A possible future contract shall require the successful completion of a First Article sample test, and ongoing lot acceptance tests.  The First Article sample shall be required to be submitted to the Government 180 days after contract award.  Monthly production deliveries may be required within 75 days after USG approval of the First Article at a production delivery rate ramping up over several months to 2,000 per month.

A SRMMP is comprised of 4 main parts: (1)a risk analysis of all CI/KR; (2) on-site visits of specific CI/KRs to evaluate risk; (3) the analysis of evaluations and risks; and (4) integration of methods to mitigate and/or manage risks.  Each part is comprised of multiple elements, depending on the scope of the SRMMP.

Specific Contractor support required for this effort will include services to: 1) develop, maintain, and enhance security risk-based decision making (RBDM) computer models,  including training for multiple USCG field units; 2) collate RBDM computer model data from USCG field units and conduct analyses to develop various security risk profiles; 3) conduct on-site evaluations of CI/KR based on security risk profiles; 4) conduct an analysis of on-site evaluations including risks; and 5)integrate analyses into RBDM computer models and strategic, operational, and tactical programs to mitigate and/or manage risk.  Contractor work will be performed at various domestic and international locations as determined by the USCG as well as the USCG Headquarters, at 2100 2nd Street, SW, Washington, DC 20593.  

For planning purposes, the USCG estimates additional services to include: 1) year round maintenance and enhancement to the RBDM computer models; 2) development of future RBDM computer models; 3) conducting 10 SRMMPs on international CI/KRs annually; 5) conducting 50 SRMMPs on domestic CI/KRs annually; 6) conducting analysis and integration of study results into multiple strategic, operational, and tactical programs; and 7) training of USCG personnel on RBDM programs and risk analysis.  Due to the nature of the information that will be used to conduct these analyses, a DoD Secret Clearance will be required for all personnel supporting this effort.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Commercial Services to Provide Administrative Support 

This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available services that may be of interest to the USCG.  The United States Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center, formerly Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, is conducting market research to determine providers of services as described follows:   

The USCG is looking for commercial services to provide administrative support in various positions throughout The Aviation Logistics Center in support of its mission to conduct depot level maintenance of USCG Aircraft and Aircraft flown by other Government Agencies as required.  These support services are to be billed based on actual hours worked times a composite hourly rate.

Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC). The Government believes the applicable NAICS Code is 561210.  Also, please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?  (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business?  (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned?   (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? 

After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the FedBizOps.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.  Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

Responses to this sources sought notice shall be submitted to Mrs. Monique Swinson, Contract Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001 or e-mailed to Monique.Swinson@uscg.mil.

<DESC>PROPOSERS DAY CONFERENCE

DARPA will host a Proposers Day Conference for the Military Networking Protocol (MNP) program on December 18th, 2008 at Westfields Marriott Washington Dulles located at 14750 Conference Center Drive, Chantilly, Virginia 20151, from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm in support of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) DARPA-BAA-09-11 which can be found on FedBizOpps website, https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=c672eaa4e4033419f46d07837fcdbe79&tab=core&_cview=0.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the Military Networking Protocol program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.   

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the Military Networking Protocol (MNP) program is to develop a network prioritization system with full user-level attribution for military computer networks.  The protocols, techniques, and devices developed in the program will de-anonymize network data flows for those computers and network enclaves using MNP technology.  Clearly identifying network traffic will allow the network infrastructure to explicitly provide prioritization levels at both the individual and unit level, reallocate bandwidth between users or classes of users, and automatically make quality of service decisions.  The de-anonymized MNP traffic will be compatible with and transit existing Internet infrastructure carrying legacy Internet traffic.  MNP-enabled networks may allow or deny entry or transit by unauthenticated data flows, and will transmit data as fast as (or faster than) existing legacy network protocols.  Hardware developed in this program will be self-configuring and will greatly reduce the need for trained network personnel and overall networks maintenance cost.
 
REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register not later than close of business (5:00 PM ET) December 8, 2008, at the following website:  https://enstg.com/signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=MIL52969  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  The attendance roster will be released to all attendees after the conclusion of the conference.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  

Due to space limitations at the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 250 registrants.  The Proposers Day will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.  Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 Foreign National Visit Request.  The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be faxed to:  Rishab Malhotra, ManTech SRS, fax (703) 312-0246, phone (703) 351-7275, email Rishab.Malhotra@wg.srs.com, no later than December 8, 2008.  The document is available for download at the registration website.  Attendance is not required to propose to the  BAA for this program.  

Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so.  Presentations may contain 4 slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues).  Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at this conference should send the request along with an electronic copy of all material to be presented to Rishab Malhotra, ManTech SRS, email Rishab.Malhotra@wg.srs.com, no later than December 8, 2008. There will be no exception to this requirement. 

All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the researching organization and the DARPA Program Manager.  The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations.  It is the presenters responsibility to ensure that all material it plans to present at the Proposers Day Conference is properly marked and has been approved by the funding organization in advance.

<DESC>As a result of the previous MSC Ship Repair Conference, MSFSC has initiated a review of work packages with the intent to standardize items and remove ambiguities and redundancies.  SWBS 000 General Requirements items is the starting point for this initiative.

The attached package provides those standardized items that will be included in all MSFSC M&R shipyard availability work packages in the future.  Please be aware of the following two points of clarification/explanation:

	1.  Many of the work items contain values that are shown as BOLD and UNDERLINED.  These represent variables expected to differ between ship classes.  These values will be input by the Port Engineer during work package development.  These values should be the same within the ship class, but may differ between different ship classes.

	2.  WI 011 Furnish General Services is a ship class specific requirement that covers all of the support services required for the vessel in the yard.  The version for the T-AOs is provided in our package, but the contractor should be aware that there is a version for each ship class.

Our intent is to establish these standardized requirements to support transparency and simplification of bidding, planning, understanding and execution of these requirements.  Please review the attached work items and provide:

1.  General comments, suggestions, questions; 
2.  Identify areas, if any, that differ from commercial practice; 3.  Identify areas, if any, that might result in unnecessary paperwork or effort or that add significantly to cost.  

Comments are requested no later than 14 November 2008. POC for comments is Kevin Spillane, phone (202) 685-5958; fax (202) 685-5942; kevin.spillane@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) through the Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Sourcing, Division Acquisition Management intends to award a sole source fixed price contract to Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD), Arlington, Virginia.  ACFDs unique capabilities to perform the required preparedness and readiness training is the only source that can satisfy the needs of the government, in accordance with FAR 6.302.


I.	Purpose

On January 1, 2007, The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) was transferred from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Office of Preparedness and Emergency Operations (OPEO). The services of the National Medical Response Team  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) team for the National Capital Region (NMRT-NCR) have been provided to the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) via a readiness cooperative agreement in past years. The services of this vital asset are requested through a new contract. The performance period of the contract will be for 12 months, beginning on the date of award.

Due to the location of the center of government in Washington, DC, NDMS, working with several Washington DC metropolitan area fire departments and the Council of Governments (COG), has developed a specialized medical response team specifically for use in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. NDMS designated this specialized team as the NMRT-NCR and assisted in developing this team as a WMD response unit to support the Federal response to a terrorism incident within the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Washington Metropolitan area is defined by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments as the National Capital Region, which is in turn defined as the following jurisdictions: The City of Alexandria, Arlington County, The District of Columbia, Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Montgomery County, Prince Georges County, Prince William County, and all included municipalities. The National Capital Region was created pursuant to the National Capital Planning Act of 1952 (Title 40, U.S.C., Sec. 71).

The mission of the NMRT-NCR, when activated, is to respond by providing mass or individual decontamination of victims within the National Capital Region contaminated by chemical, biological, or radiological agents; provide medical care and/or stabilization for these victims; assist in triage and treatment before and after decontamination; provide technical assistance to local EMS officials; and, pre-deploy when directed, as a result of a credible or potential terrorist threat.

OPEO/NDMS seeks to enter into a contract with the Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD), Arlington, VA.  The resulting contract will be for the readiness and preparedness of the NMRT-NCR.  This Statement of Work sets forth the requirements for the readiness and preparedness of team personnel, the storage of equipment and supplies, and the quality control, maintenance, exercise, and contingent deployment of supplies and specialized response equipment consistent with the mission of the NMRT-NCR. The NMRT-NCR shall be ready to deploy personnel and material for immediate use in responding to a WMD or mass casualty incident within the NCR.  The vehicles, products and other specialized materials and stored and maintained under this contract shall be known as the NMRT-NCR cache.  The exact location of this storage site shall be FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY and shall be referred to as the NMRT-NCR cache site. 

The purpose of this contract is to assure the readiness of the NMRT-NCR so that it is prepared to provide qualified, competent personnel in support of ASPR/OPEO response requirements under the National Response Framework (NRF).   This includes preparations for incidents involving WMD, National Special Security Events (NSSE) and/or other designated major disasters, or emergencies, including public health emergencies.  This contract enables the NMRT-NCR to maintain a condition of high operational readiness and identifies key areas for NMRT-NCR personnel to focus continued preparedness efforts.

<DESC>By way of this Notice and in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District, US Army Corps of Engineers, announces its intentions to award a sole source contract to V3 Companies of Illinois, LTD. (V3) of 7325 Janes Avenue, Woodridge, Illinois, for the purpose of providing site restoration services.  Under the contract, V3 will be primarily responsible for placing three different seeding mixtures, installing erosion control blankets (ECB), installing turf reinforcing mats (TRM) and planting the design mix of live plants.  Two environmentally significant ravines exist in parallel locations north (Janes Ravine) and south (Hutchinson Ravine) of the project site. The Fort Sheridan Estuary Restoration Project, which is authorized by Section 104 of the Estuary Protection Act of 2000, is the final piece of constructing a swale/channel to divert storm water runoff away from these two ravines.  The first part of the project was awarded by the Lake County Forest Preserve.  The USACE portion of the project is critically linked to the work currently being performed by V3 under the aforementioned contract.   The work being performed under this impending contract requires that the work be completed concurrently so that the project management of hydrological modifications does not further damage the project site.  The period of performance is for approximately 1,444 calendar days.  It is anticipated that the resultant contact will be a firm-fixed price service contract.  This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers, proposals, etc.  STATEMENTS/RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON DECEMBER 15, 2008.  Statements should be sent to the attention of Anita Simpkins at anita.r.simpkins@usace.army.mil; ENSURE THAT THE SUBJECT LINE OF YOUR EMAIL INCLUDES THE TITLE/DESCRIPTION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Award is anticipated on or about December 26, 2008. This announcement is in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The point of contact is Anita Simpkins at (312) 846-5372.

Statement of Work:  

1.  BACKGROUND:

Oral health is vital for force health protection. Failure to achieve a standard of oral health could preclude a soldier from deploying. Dental Readiness is a command responsibility. DoD established a uniform dental classification in HA Policy 02-11. DoD policy requires dental screening examinations to be accomplished and documented on 90% of service members. Members of the Army National Guard shall receive an annual dental screening examination to determine their dental classification. The results of that screening examination shall be entered into the DENCLASS database no later than 5 days from the date of examination. The DENCLASS database updates the Army Medical Protection System (MEDPROS).  Dental treatment may be required as well, at certain times.

2.  OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE:

The objective of this State of Work is to conduct and complete the requirement of Dental Readiness on selected Soldiers in the 2/108th IN, 1/69th IN, 1569th TRANS CO,  369th Signal Network Support Detachment, and HQ 53rd Troop Command, utilizing a mobile dental facility. Those requirements include:
	Clinical evaluation of the oral cavity by a licensed dentist employing visual clinical exam supported by bitewing dental radiographs. Panographic dental radiographs must represent the Soldiers current dental condition. Panographs are to be taken if there is no panograph in the record, if an existing panograph is greater than 10 years old, or if the Soldier has had major dental work since last panograph. Also the dentist may order a panograph if deemed clinically necessary to complete a proper dental exam. Radiographs will be taken by dental technicians. Existing adequate panographs that are analog images will be scanned electronically and uploaded into DENCLASS.
	Each exam will be entered into the DENCLASS reporting system within 24 hours of examination by ASM Research (ASMR) trained personnel, annotated on the Standard Form (SF) 603 (Health Record  Dental) and on the SF 5570 (Health Questionnaire for Dental Treatment) of the Soldiers dental record.
	Personnel performing the dental screening examination have a moral and ethical obligation to inform the Soldier if they observe or are apprised of any sign or symptom for which the Soldier should obtain further evaluation or care.
	A dental screening examination identifies deficiencies but does NOT include the dental treatment required to correct those deficiencies.


3.  DEFINITIONS:

Incorporating live tissue training into tactical scenarios is the highest standard of casualty response preparedness.

3.5	Description of Work to be Performed:
3.5.1	Management of Hemorrhage  Practical exercises throughout the exercise will enhance operator confidence and understanding of the principles of managing blood loss in the tactical environment.

3.5.2	Airway Management  The focus of this instruction is designed to establish the early recognition and intervention of respiratory distress.  The tools available to the operator are limited; however, the management of airway obstruction must not be overlooked in the immediate actions for casualty care.  Airway management is the second priority for the management of battlefield casualties and quick recognition of the signs and symptoms associated with obstruction and distress are vital to the immediate outcome of the casualty.  Practical exercises are designed to provide the basic skills of airway management with respect to the phases of casualty care, and include the discussion of airway adjuncts and the performance of the various improvised and practiced techniques.

3.5.3	Chest Injury Management  Techniques for the management of life threatening chest injuries are discussed and performed along with the observation and participation in the reduction of a tension pneumothorax injury.  The ability to recognize casualties who ar suffering from respiratory distress in the field and provide the competency to perform emergent intervention and subsequent management.

3.5.4	Abdominal Injury Management  The ability to practice and build confidence in the manipulation and treatment of a live abdominal injury is unmatched.  The live tissue model provides the feedback necessary for the Special Operator to understand and develop competent skills for the management of abdominal injuries using improvised and practiced techniques.

3.5.5	Combat Injury Management Exercise  This exercise is a culmination of all the previous skills learned.  Attendees are presented with the treatment of multiple critically injured patients in the field.  Injuries representative of true combat modalities are presented (e.g. ballistic, blast, fragmentation, etc).

<p>In the past when we have bought these services we have received the bundled price. However regulations restrict us from paying for all three years upfront. We intend to write the contract for a basic year and two option years. I hope this helps answer your question. Thanks!

EVALUATION AND AWARD:

The Government intends to evaluate proposals however; the Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.  The award will be made to the offeror whose proposal conforms to the terms and conditions of the solicitation under a Firm Fixed Price contract.  Criteria for technical qualifications are based on a weighted average and are outlined below:  


TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS POST AWARD:

CRITERIA
WEIGHT
Technical Approach and Expertise
50%
1) The offerors proposal shall include a detailed, technically and methodically sound maintenance plan for all Line Scan x-ray machines listed for FDA locations in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and a plan addressing procedures for scheduling maintenance and performing repair and service of equipment within a 24 hour response time.  The plans shall include how maintenance and service calls will be administered.  The plan shall include the personnel and material resources to be committed to accomplishing the plan and indicate the assignments of key personnel.  The plan must also demonstrate the offerors understanding of all relevant industry related technical and mechanical methods and the managerial skills required for timely completion of all tasks set forth in the Statement of Work which shall include, but are not limited to, the following:

1) Training and experience of the offerors technicians in maintenance and repair of Line Scan X-Ray machines and other related equipment list in the Statement of Work
2) The adequacy and suitability of the offerors support personnel, and subcontractor(s) support personnel.  Identify personnel who will be assigned to this requirement and demonstrate their qualifications, background, recent experience and specific accomplishments.
3) Demonstrated evidence that the Contractor has a sufficient number of personnel or subcontractors and to be able to respond within a 24 hour timeframe. 
4) Demonstrated evidence that the Contractor has accessibility to official Line Scan equipment parts.

Emergencies
10%
Demonstrate the ability to support adequate staff and services in the event of an emergency.

Organizational Experience
30%
Demonstrate organizational experience in managing a maintenance and service contract for x-ray machine equipment.
1) Evidence of the availability of Line Scan x-ray machine spare parts and materials for warranty and service calls.

Quality Control Plan
10%
Offerors shall submit a quality control plan, which addresses the adequacy and approach of the maintenance and service contract for the Line Scan x-ray machines owned and operated by the FDA.

PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
Past Performance findings will be highly influential in determining the relative merits and risks associated with the Offerors proposal in a comparative assessment with all competitors.  The Government will evaluate the reputation and quality of the Offerors past performance.  The assessment of the Offerors past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the Offeror to other Offerors.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  The Government is seeking to determine whether an Offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.

Offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the Offerors response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration.  In investigating the Offerors past performance, the Government will consider references submitted by the Offeror and may consider information from other sources.  Some of the questions in the referenced evaluation questionnaires are associated with point values and some are included in the questionnaire without point values to allow the Government a subjective assessment of the Offerors performance.  The Government will make a subjective evaluation of past performance in consideration of both average scores and responses to subjective questions. A minimum of three corporate references from contracts with a similar scope and nature completed within the last three years will be evaluated.  Information may also be obtained from sources other than those identified by the offeror.

Is the monthly allowance and the estimate overage cost supposed to be the combined usage for the copier? If not, which number should we base our pricing on?The monthly allowance is supposed to be the usage for the copier.  The estimate overage is a cushion of money added to the contract to cover any possible extra copies produced above the monthly allowance.  Do not blend the two to give your monthly pricing.  Each should be a separate line item.  The estimate overage should be based on the rate you charge per copy for overage multiplied by the estimated overage per month which is separate from the monthly maintenance cost based on the monthly allowance.2.  Is there a previous contract? What were last year contract cost and vendor?There were 3 separate contracts that were awarded last year to cover this requirement.  They were as follows:VA Contract Number	Vendor	Total Amount	8V7058	Canon c/o IKON Office Solutions	$2180.00	8V7071	Canon c/o IKON Office Solutions	$4800.00	8Y8001	Canon c/o IKON Office Solutions	$4356.00	8V7070	Canon c/o IKON Office Solutions	$3798.00

<CONTACT>Joseph L. Facciolo, Contract Specialist, Phone (315) 330-4981, Fax (315) 330-8078, Email facciolj@rl.af.mil
<DESC><p>The purpose of this notice is to provide additional information to all interested parties in the solicitation process for the Automated Virtual Information Production Support System (AVIPSS) III &ndash; formally Solicitation No. FA8750-07-R-0016 and to perform market research that will glean useful information from industry that can incorporated in the solicitation. The Government is (a) requesting industry input regarding best commercial practices for possible use in finalizing the acquisition strategy, (b) providing another opportunity for potential sources to provide capability packages in the event that the change in NAICS code impacts the determination not to conduct this acquisition as a small business set-aside, and (c) also serves as a notice of proposed contract action. The primary customer for the AVIPSS III Program is the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. NASIC, under the command of the AF Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Agency, is the Air Force&rsquo;s single air and space intelligence production center and the primary DoD producer of foreign aerospace intelligence. The NASIC production program responds to guidance provided by their headquarters, AF ISR Agency, the Air Staff, and the DIA. The AVIPSS III Program supports NASIC mission responsibilities in Electronic Combat assigned by HQ USAF and in the DoDIIS Migration Systems development and deployment as assigned by the DIA and HQ USAF. AFRL RRS has a requirement to build on and extend the current National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) automated threat database production system, consisting of the Automated Virtual Information Production Support System (AVIPSS), the Knowledge Pre-positioning System (KPS), Virtual Production System (VPS), Virtual Intelligence Production (VIP), NASIC Metadata Repository (NMR) and the Virtual Intelligence Product Retrieval Environment (VIPRE). The AVIPSS, KPS, VPS, VIP, NMR, and VIPRE are components critical to this effort. The design, development, implementation, and integration of new components with the AVIPSS, KPS, VPS, VIP, NMR and VIPRE will provide the Information Technology (IT) solution to NASIC&rsquo;s corporate objectives for pre-positioning its analytical knowledge and for enabling customers and other intelligence analysts to build a custom and persistent product well into the future. The effort will include the development and/or expansion of parametric information models; design of physical and logical database structures; development, implementation, and enhancement of the capability to interactively maintain data within the databases; implementation and enhancement of the capabilities to derive tailored specialized products from the textual and parametric databases and multimedia object repositories; design of high level constructs that dynamically incorporate database information into indivisible groups of objects that answer customer questions; and the development and implementation of customer friendly tools and interfaces. Further, this effort supports the development, enhancement, implementation and maintenance of national level systems for the input, translation, and retrieval of all-source information and for the continued design, development, implementation and deployment of a DoD Intelligence Information System (DODIIS)-wide information notification system. Anticipated deliverables include software, databases, and technical documentation. To qualify as a responsible contractor, the Offeror must have an appropriate number of key personnel (approximately 40-45 cleared personnel) that can have access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or be clearable (Final U.S. Top Secret Clearance without waiver and a Special Background Investigation either on record or in process) that will be available for assignment to this effort immediately upon contract award. Initially this solicitation was to be based on a Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Completion, Research and Development contract with an ordering period of 48 months and maximum ordering amount of $49.9M &ndash; See original Sources Sought posted on Jan 18, 2007 for more details of this program. It has since been determined that this effort will be a Performance Based Service Acquisition (PBSA). PBSA involves acquisition strategies, methods, and techniques that describe the measurable outcomes rather than direct performance processes. PBSA is structured around defining a service requirement in terms of performance standards and performance measurement and providing contractors the latitude to determine how to meet those standards. At this time the exact contract type -- i.e. Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Incentive Fee, etc. -- has not been decided and we would like industry to provide suggestions as to what type of contract they feel would best fit the work to be performed under the AVIPSS III PBSA effort, and why. One important characteristic is that AVIPSS III performance requires software enhancements and resolutions to software requirements and problems that cannot be identified consistently or definitively in advance of tasking due to the fast-changing volatile environment in which NASIC and its customers operate; therefore the work description for each order will be broader in scope to allow for flexibility. This creates a conundrum &ndash; how do we develop and evaluate performance standards for requirements that are not known in advance? To help solve this dilemma we are requesting that industry also provide input on performance standards, performance thresholds, and surveillance methods, as well as sample customer survey questions, that will allow for a reliable method for evaluating contractor performance, measuring performance outcomes, and providing contractor incentives for superior performance. The Government is interested in industry input on what the customary commercial business practices are for procuring custom computer programming services in a fast-changing environment where detailed requirements are not known in advance. Provide input on the above issues directly to the Contract Specialist, Joseph Facciolo, at Joseph.Facciolo@rl.af.mil no later than 30 MAY 2008. Evaluation of the capability packages received in response to the previous Sources Sought announcement resulted in a determination that a small business set-aside was not warranted. This notice seeks to provide an additional opportunity to all small businesses that have the resources to perform this effort to provide a statement of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions and resource necessary to successfully compete for this award (See Numbered Note 25). Provide information on at least 3 contracts for similar work within the past 5 years. Include complete references, contract titles, dollar values, points of contact and telephone numbers. The Government will evaluate relevant experience information based on (1) information provided by the respondent; (2) information obtained from the references provided by the respondent; and/or (3) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In addition to the statement of capabilities, please provide answers to the following questions: (1) Does your company intend to submit a proposal in response to the upcoming solicitation as a prime contractor? (2) How many people does your company employ? (3) How many TS/SCI cleared personnel are currently available? (4) Will you need to hire additional personnel to perform this effort? (5) Is your company&rsquo;s cost accounting system approved by DCAA or DCMA? If not, how would your company financially administer a cost-reimbursement type contract? (6) Are there any other factors concerning your company&rsquo;s ability to perform the upcoming effort that the Air Force should consider? The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511 and the small business size standard is average annual receipts of $23M. Respondents are requested to indicate whether they are a large business, small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, historically black college or university (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) (as defined by the clause at DFARS 252.226-7000). Respondents are also requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign nation employees on this effort. Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level. A technical read library (on CD disk) relating to the subject area of this acquisition is available for review by potential offerors. Access may be gained by contacting the Program Manager, Mr. James Sieffert, at 315-330-2344. The library contains sensitive technical data; therefore, prior to the read library disk being mailed, respondents must submit a copy of an approved DD Form 2345, &ldquo;Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement,&rdquo; which certifies the respondent is on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL), along with a letter from the Data Custodian designated on that form, authorizing access by whomever will be reviewing the library, to ATTN: Mr. James Sieffert, AVIPSS III Program Manager, at Air Force Research Laboratory/RIEB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505, or fax to his attention at 315-330-3038, James.Sieffert@us.af.mil. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Information Service at 1-877-352-2255 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp. In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Rebecca S.P. Willsey, (315) 330-4710, Rebecca.Willsey@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Susan Hunter, Building 15, RM225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 FAX: 937-255-5036 COM: 937-255-7754.

The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Governments inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares and product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1.

The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post answers to questions received, and to remove the local set-aside restriction. The Service reserves the right to award one or more BPA as result of this solicitation. Below are the questions and answers:

 Q: Which A/E or Interior Design firm is the incumbent? A: Yes, Esoarc Studio, Inc. 
Q: Is the threshold of up to $500,000 for each year or over the full five years?A: The $500,000 ceiling is for all five years. Q: Our Company is a women-owned business and would be the prime.Does this solicitation also require that the mechanical, electrical, plumbing consulting firm be women-owned?A: We mandate that 51% of the work must be accomplished by the prime, women-owned contractor; the remainder can be sub-contracted to other firms that do not have to meet those restrictions.
Q: The description says:  This is a local set-aside restricted to the Washington, DC and locations within 50 miles of Washington, DC. Can the prime women owned business have a joint-venture or subcontractor women-owned business outside the restriction area?Q: Are only qualified local Washington, DC and companies within 50 miles of Washington, DC allowed to submit?  A: Above, under Amendment 1 this set aside has been removed to encourage maximum competition. Offerors however are informed that no per-diem nor travel funds will be made available under this solicitation.
Q: I'm assuming we do not have to have a team of engineers for design build projects?  This is strictly for architecture and interior services?A: No the qualified contractor does not have to have a design build team available. The Service anticipates there may be a need for design build throughout the life of the BPA however the main focus is on the quality of interior design services, customer service, and ability to apply greening requirements. 
Q: The solicitation states that the Government will not provide any equipment or property under this agreement.  Can you please clarify if that means that all meetings will be done on-site but the majority of the actual "work" (i.e. creating drawings) can be done at an off-site location (i.e. our office)?  A: That is correct; the majority of work is expected to occur at the contractor's facility. The contractor will be called upon to attend meetings at the Government facilities and walk the project site. The contractor also must be available sometimes on short notice to appear at the project site and/or meet with customers. Note that the Service does not have funds available to reimburse for travel to the site if the site is in the Washington, DC Metro area. Q: We are a small, woman owned business that performs all of the services required under this solicitation, except for generating construction documents.  Can we sub-contract for that task?  A: Yes if 51% of the work can still be performed by the prime.
Q: Because the solicitation states that sub-contracting is acceptable with prior Government approval, will we need to reference the sub-contractor in a separate form 330, Part II at this time?  A: Yes, you must list using the SF330 the firms you will be doing business with. 
Q: Does our sub-contractor need to be small business, woman owned as well?A: No 
Q: Can you please clarify if the contractor will perform design/build projects or manage them?  Or both?A: It is up to the prime how the work will be distributed as long as 51% is performed by the prime contractor.
Q: It states that interested firms must submit two paper copies of SF330, Part I and II.  The solicitation then states that it must be submitted as one file, using MS Word or Adobe Acrobat.  Can you please clarify if we need to submit both two (2) hard copies to you and an electronic file, or just one or the other?A: Companies may choose their method of submission: e-mail in one file or mail two paper copies.

<RESPDATE>123109
<CONTACT>Mily H. Le, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-882-6301, Email mily.le.ctr@mda.mil
<DESC>The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to defend the US, its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack. As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capability, modify and improve on existing technologies (commercial and dual-use) for insertion into BMDS Elements, and improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats. To investigate these technologies and technology insertion opportunities, MDA has established a Deputy for Engineering, Producibility and Manufacturing (DEP) whose mission is to identify technology insertion candidates and open/modular systems applications that enhance producibility, quality and/or reliability, lower cost and/or reduce risk for all BMDS elements. 

The MDA/DEP seeks new and innovative concepts for individual projects improving the producibility, quality and reliability of: (1) Anti-Tamper/Software Protection; (2) Radar Systems  Antennas, Transmit/Receive Modules, Signal Processing, Optical Signal Processing, Thermal Management, RF Seekers; (3) Electro-Optical Systems - Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar, Focal Plane Arrays, High Energy Lasers, Beam Control; (4) Propulsion  Booster, Divert and Attitude Control Systems (DACS) (5) Materials Processing  Composite Structures, Thermal Management Materials, IR Windows; (6) Electronics - Wide Band Gap Materials and Devices, Radiation Hardened/Tolerant Electronics, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Data Links; (7) Power Systems  Batteries, Fuel Cells, Photovoltaic Arrays; (8) Software  application of COTS products to signal processing, middleware, operating systems, simulations and networking; and (9) Manufacturing Processes (supply chain management, obsolescence, and tin-whiskers). 

This solicitation is open to all US and International Business, Universities, and Government organizations.  If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary white paper (not to exceed five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA/DEP program; (2) a Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities. Offerors that have been certified as a Small Business Concern should indicate that status on their submittal. Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows, 2004 or earlier version, or a clearly readable .pdf file, Adobe 7.0 or earler) to the point of contact listed below. White paper submissions should be marked appropriately if they contain proprietary or trade secret information. In addition, please advise the Government of any limitations on the Governments rights in technical data, which might be provided in connection with the effort described in the white paper. The MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following criteria (weighed equally): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA/DEP program, to include maturity and level of risk; (2) the ability to develop and demonstrate near-term applications; (3) the offers capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (the ROCM). Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35.016). Furthermore, evaluations will be in accordance with DFARS 252.225-7018.

This BAA will remain open until December 31, 2009. Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete. 

The Government may use selected support contractor and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement. These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. Submission of white papers to this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgement and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process. 

Only Government personnel will make a determination on proposals.  In some circumstances, non-government, technical personnel from support contractors will provide advisory and assistance services to MDA, providing technical analysis of white papers and proposals submitted to MDA.

Support Contractor organizations:  Millennium Engineering and Integration (MEI), Advanced Product Transitions (APT), SPARTA, and Dynamics Research Corp. (DRC).

Individual support contractors from these organizations will be authorized access to only those portions of the proposal data and discussions that are necessary to enable them to perform their respective duties. These organizations are expressly prohibited from scoring or ranking of proposals or recommending the selection of a source. In accomplishing their duties related to the source selection process, the aforementioned organizations may require access to proprietary information contained in the offerors' proposals. 

Pursuant to FAR 9.505-4, the MDA contracts with these support contractors include a clause which essentially requires them to (1) protect the offerors information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and (2) refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished. In addition, MDA requires the employees of those support contractors that provide technical analysis to the DEP program to execute non-disclosure agreements. 

The MDA PMO will conduct an inventory of all proposals received, in each individual topic area, to ensure no conflict of interest issues exist prior to execution of any advisory and assistance services.  If we find that any contractor listed above submits a proposal under an MDA/DEP BAA, we will verify whether the proposal raises any potential conflicts of interest.  MDA anticipates that proposals submitted under a topic area unrelated to the pertinent MDA field activity to which the contractor provides technical support may be allowed if the contracting officer determines that there is no organizational conflict of interest or that any real or apparent conflict of interest is adequately mitigated or avoided.


MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards; however, if MDA does decides to pursue a concept, the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing. MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA. Any awards are anticipated to occur in FY 2008 through FY 2010.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award) or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals submitted, or to select only part of an effort described in a proposal for award. The point of contact for concept submittals and questions is Mily H. Le, Contract Specialist, at (703) 882-6301 or email at mily.le.ctr@mda.mil

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide an update to Industry on the status of the MiDAESS acquisition.

The Missile Defense Agency conducted a pre-Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP) meeting in August 2008 to review the MiDAESS program.  The MiDAESS program office brief several overarching acquisition strategy revisions to Senior Leadership.  The proposed revisions to the acquisition strategy include conducting one source selection with two RFPs, one RFP issued on a full and open competition basis and one as a small business set aside.  The RFPs would be released simultaneously with separate multiple awards based on separate functional groups.  It is contemplated there will be five functional groups in each RFP, identified in separate CLINS, based on commonality of the areas.  Proposed groups for the full and open RFP are:  Acquisition Support, Engineering, Deployment Support, Agency Operations, and Security.  Proposed groups for the small business set aside are:  Quality, Safety, and Mission Assurance (QSMA); Acquisition Support; Engineering; Deployment Support; and Agency Operations.  NAICS codes will be established per group and each group will have multiple contracts awarded.  For example, the Engineering group may include separate CLINs for systems engineering, test, and advanced technology areas.  Offerors will be required to submit proposals to include all CLINs in the applicable group, unless the solicitation states otherwise.  Multiple awards will be made at the group (Engineering) level, i.e., potential offerors/teams must propose and be capable of performing the requirements at the Engineering "group" level covering multiple CLINs.  Contracts awarded in the Engineering group will include separate CLINS for systems engineering, test, and advanced technology.  Task orders applicable to each CLIN will be competed among the contractors awarded contracts in the Engineering group.   Potential offerors are reminded that this strategy is not final.  Therefore, only the strategy contained in the final RFPs should be utilized for proposal purposes.

As stated in our previous draft RFP, we have met with some Industry representatives who had previously requested meetings to discuss their potential organizational conflicts of interest.  We have received good feedback from Industry on the processes some firm have established with other agencies for mitigating or avoiding certain conflicts of interest.  We continue to be concerned about bias-type or impaired objectivity conflicts.  As part of the next draft RFP, we will solicit input from Industry on proposed approaches to address bias-type or impaired objectivity conflicts.

Currently, the MiDAESS Program Office is working the proposed strategy for the two RFPs.  We expect to release the Draft RFPs in Fall 2008.  Subsequently, we plan to hold an industry day in November/December timeframe.  Final RFPs are expected to be released on/about December 2008 with proposals due on/about February 2009.

Please hold any questions about the proposed revision to the acquisition strategy until the draft RFP is released, as there may be additional changes.  The plan is to respond to questions after the draft RFP is released.

This is a pre-solicitation notice by the Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, VT State Office, to obtain appraisal services for acquisition of conservation easements on behalf of the United States of America, acting by and through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine.  The conservation easements will be for wetlands and other conservation practices in accordance with the Wetlands Reserve Program and other Farm Bill programs.  The contractor shall furnish all appraisal services according to USPAP guidelines.

For planning purposes, there are expected to be approximately 30 appraisals to be completed in each contract year.   The solicitation will be divided into zones for proposal and order purposes.  Respondents may offer on any or all zones.  It is estimated that between five (5) and thirty (30) appraisals per year may be needed.  The minimum order guaranteed by the government is one appraisal per contract awarded.  Total delivery orders issued against each contract for all years can not exceed $500,000.  The contractor will also be asked to submit pricing for time-sensitive delivery of services (less than 20 day turn-around) in addition to regular pricing.  

The NRCS intends to award an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) fixed-price contract to a small business source capable of providing real estate appraisals for a base period of one year and four option years for a total of approximately five years. An IDIQ fixes a price for an appraisal, should it be ordered.  There is a guaranteed minimum of one appraisal per contract for the base year and no guaranteed minimum for the option periods.  It is anticipated that more than one contract may be awarded from the solicitation.  

The contractor is responsible for having a current knowledge of the requirements of state law in connection with real estate transactions and appraisals.  Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser or obtain a state temporary practice permit and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued. Appraisers must demonstrate competency in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) in conducting appraisals of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type. All appraisals completed for this program shall comply with USPAP and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.

This is 100% set-aside for small-business. The associated NAICS code is 531320 and the small business size standard is $2.0 million in average annual receipts.

All contractors must register in the Central Contractors Registration database at www.ccr.gov. The CCR Customer Assistance Center can be contacted toll free at: 1-888-227-2423. The first step to registering is to obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, which is a unique nine-character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun and Bradstreet (D&B). To request a DUNS number, call D&B at the toll free number 1-866-705-5711 or register on-line at http://www.dnb.com/ccr/register.html. Obtaining a DUNS number through this process is free of charge. Its a good idea for anyone who is submitting a proposal to begin this process as soon as possible since it can take several days to complete. Failure to register by close of business on the third day after notification of possible award by the Contracting Officer, may cause rejection of your offer. Prospective contractors also must complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. (see FAR 4.1102) Prospective contractors shall update the representations and certifications submitted to ORCA as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete.

All prospective contractors will be required to review all documents pertinent to the solicitation.  All offerors that meet the qualifications in the attached Appraisal Specification will be considered for award.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror(s) based on price.  Since award will be based on initial responses, offerors are encouraged to offer the most advantageous pricing in their response.  

The solicitation package and all attachments will be posted to this website on or about 15 days from issuance of this notice.  Responses will be due approximately 30 days after issuance of the solicitation.

NAICS Code 541712.  Provide quote for a scientific research vessel and crew for the collection of hydrographic profiles and sediment collection samples off the Coast of Virginia Beach.
A scientific research vessel is needed with a fully staffed, experienced and trained technical crew to support the sampling effort.  A minimum of six crew members shall be provided with at least three crew members on watch at all times.  The crew must be well versed in the collection and interpretation of hydrographic profiles and sediment collection in order to operate equipment including trawls and dredges to meet these objectives.  The vessel must be able to withstand seas of at least 8 feet while still being able to operate the appropriate equipment to perform the necessary sampling.  A ship designed to meet ICES noise standards for fisheries is required.  
The principal duties of the Captain and crew will be operating the vessel, performing vessel operations, and the operation of vessel equipment in support of the sampling effort (i.e., operating winches, dredges, CTDs).  The EPA research staff shall conduct the sampling.  It is anticipated sampling will occur 24 hours a day with staff changes every 6 hours.  
The sampling locations are: the Norfolk Ocean Disposal Site (located approximately 17 miles east of the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay)(site is a circle with a radius of 4 nautical miles), a control site (located 5 miles north and 2 miles east of the Norfolk Ocean Disposal Site)(site is a circle with a radius of 4 nautical miles), and the Fish Waste Site (located 10-15 miles to the east of Ship Shoal Inlet) (the site is a 25 square nautical mile area with the center at 37 degrees, 18.50 minutes latitude).  
The estimated number of samples consists of: 8 to 10 CTD samples, 55 sediment samples, eight (8) 20-minute trawls, and eight (8) 20-minute dredges.
The ship must also have the following equipment on board and operational: a certified, calibrated instrument capable of collecting water quality parameters (i.e. CTD and rosette); a calibrated dredge capable of collecting 8 - 10 centimeters worth of sediment from the surface of the ocean floor at a depth of at least 45 feet; and at least one (1) 20' trawl net.    The vessel must also be equipped with lines, cables, winches, and accessories required to operate all of the equipment necessary for the completion of this sampling effort.  The vessel shall conduct CTD profiles and sediment collection simultaneously.  An electronic copy of all data collected during the cruise shall be made available to the EPA research crew prior to leaving the vessel upon the mission's completion at no additional cost.  A separate (not "hot") berth for each EPA research crew member, bathing facilities, a chef, and all of the food required for three (3) hot meals per each 24 hour period on board shall be provided to the EPA research crew of at least 8 people for the entirety of the sampling expedition at no additional cost to the Government.
Due to the timeliness of this data collection, and the pending winter weather, the vessel and crew shall be available to conduct this survey during the period from date of order through the estimated completion date of November 10th, 2008.
Quoters shall provide a proposal including a fully loaded rate for use of the vessel, Captain, and crew for 72 consecutive hours (This rate shall be inclusive of the use of the vessel, the Captain, and crew services, and all charges including but not limited to associated costs such as docking fees, picking up and dropping off the research staff at a mutually agreeable (between the EPA and quoter) port(s), port fees, fuel, food for the EPA research staff, and use of the required equipment and vessel for the 72 hour sampling effort period).
Quoters shall also provide in the proposal a fully loaded rate for use of the vessel, Captain, and crew for an additional 24 hour period (4th day), or part thereof.  This is an option that can be exercised if the sampling effort is not completed with the 72 hour initial period.  This rate shall be inclusive of the use of the vessel, the Captain, and crew services, and all charges including but not limited to associated costs such as docking fees, picking up and dropping off the research staff at a mutually agreeable (between the EPA and quoter) port(s), port fees, fuel, food for the EPA research staff, and use of the required equipment and vessel for the additional 24 hour (or part thereof) sampling effort period.

<DESC>CARTS Pre-Solicitation Notice Comments Tracking<BR>	<BR>1.  3.3) Are we correct in thinking that as with ITSC the diagrams depicting a PD are for functional capability only and we are free to propose our own structure regarding the number of boxes and/or enclosures within a pit?	Answer:  Yes, within limits; in the course of time however we expect single subsystem boxes.<BR><BR>2.  3.3) Will primary power output 120 VAC only be required for PDs with 120/240 VAC input?  Answer:  Yes. AC output will be expected for AC input, and DC output will be expected for DC input.<BR><BR>3.  Appendix B- Are diamond design with specified spacing, interlocking rails constructed out of material with the required clearances sufficient or are vendors required to implement a new more costly design?	Answer:  Yes, the diamond designs will be made of sufficient material with required clearances.  No, vendors are not required to implement any new designs. <BR><BR>4. Dimensions of the rails do not appear to be adequate to support MAT. Can larger rails meeting the spacing and diamond shape be used?  Answer:  Please clarify larger.<BR><BR>5.  Page 20, Section 3.4.1, Thermal Signatures- We suggest that the standard be further defined as follows:<BR>*Infantry thermals replicate the actual thermal signature of humans; head approximately 20 degrees F above ambient and body approximately 10 degrees F above ambient.<BR>*The target is capable of generating a thermal signature within specifications at ambient temperatures between -30 degrees and 120 degrees F.<BR>*Be capable of generating a gradient thermal image that realistically replicates the actual gradient thermal temperatures of the representation.  Answer: We will update the Specification for temperature range.<BR><BR>6.  Page 13 Section 3.3 Presentation Devices, Paragraph 6:  We suggest that the specification pertains specifically to the height and width dimensions only to allow for improved designs of the Ivan, specifically those that better accept overlays. We acknowledge all 3D targets would meet all other design/performance specifications (self healing, wind resistance, snow resistance, amount of lifts, etc.).  Answer: Silhouette can be of any shape as long as it is able to be held by the standard bracket as defined by the drawings included in the Specifications. <BR><BR>7.  Page 20, Section 3.4 Representation Devices:<BR>Because round caliber is undefined within the performance specification and therefore left open to interpretation, we suggest the following be added: &expose to 1500 hits of 5.56mm, or 300 hits of 7.62mm or 100 hits of .50 Cal. Spread over the whole target.   Answer:  Noted; we will update the Specifications with revised requirements.<BR><BR>8.  2.2.2 Configure Hit Sensor Command Message:  We suggest you allow for bits 184-N to be allow for programming the different types of zones on our programmable targets. Zones on contact based location of hit systems so that targets can be programmed to support dynamic Mortal, Non-Mortal, and Incapacitated zones by sending geometric patterns and associated mortality type information.  Answer:  This is not a current requirement. The ability to report hits by zone is covered by the Hit Record (Table XXII) within the Hit Status Message (Message 3115, Table VIII).<BR><BR>9.  2.2.7 Hit Sensor Configuration Status Message:  We suggest that you assign bits 232-N for contact location of hit targets to return configuration data that will describe the location and type of zones currently programmed into target.  Answer:  The ability to report hits by zone is covered by the Hit Record (Table XXII) within the Hit Status Message (Message 3115, Table VIII).<BR><BR>10.  2.2.8 Hit Status Message: We suggest that you allow for X-Y location data sent from contact based location of hit targets to be displayed, in the form of a graphic dot, on the Command center display as well as the shooters portable display system. Answer:  This is not a requirement of the PD ICD. It will be included in the ESD ICD.<BR><BR>11.  2.4.5 Hit Sensor Configuration Record:  We suggest that you allow for multiple. For example a circular mortal zone 1 located in the head of contact based location of hit targets would be defined as Z1, C50, 84, 22, M1 where Z1 designates Zone 1, C designates Circle with center at 50, 84 and a radius of 22 assigned a mortality of 1 Mortal.   Answer:  The ability to report hits by zone is covered by the Hit Record (Table XXII) within the Hit Status Message (Message 3115, Table VIII.<BR><BR>12.  3.3 Performance Specifications:  This is a very tight requirement for a power supply to service thermal targets. On battery powered ranges, the thermal will operate from unregulated battery voltage (12 -14.4 volts). What is the rationale for specifying an unnecessarily expensive and restrictive requirement here?	  Answer:  The need for power conversion has been overcome by design events. Verbiage on regulation will likely be removed.<BR><BR>13.  3.3.1.9 Contact Hit Sensor:  A contact hit sensor cannot satisfy the stated requirement. Does the government expect every SAT to be equipped with some sort of LOMAH device that can perform round discrimination?  Answer:  No; A basic SAT must be able to determine the relative size of the round for appropriate BDA, e.g. differentiation of .50 cal vice 120mm. LOMAH requirements will be part of the ESD ICD.<BR><BR>14. Are you planning on conducting an industry day?  Answer:  There is no planned Industry Day at this time.<BR><BR>15.  Is this a new requirement or a re-competition?  Answer:  This is a new acquisition.<BR><BR>16.  Will there be any Small Business provisions and/or goals?	Answer:  Yes, there will be 1 LOT set aside for Small Business.<BR><BR>17.  In order to prepare for this proposal it is necessary to review the software, it protocols, and the source code.  Can you be so kind to tell me how I can get a copy of the software, the protocols, and source code?	Answer:  The requested information is available through the Live Training Transformation (LT2) Information Portal (https://www.lt2portal.org/).<BR><BR>18.  I understand the Governments desire to standardize and the benefits of standardization, however the current specification for diamonded rail is probably not in the best interest of the Government.  Here is why.  The Government training requirements have changed since PEO STRI (US Army TMO) made the decision to use diamond rail as the standard.  While this specification may have been valid then, the Iraq war and evolving training requirements identified additional needs such as the check point movers. Check point movers require much tighter turns than what was required in the past for either amour or infantry movers. SPARTA procured some movers using diamond rail in the past at the direction of one of our customers.   Our experience was this. The diamond rail simply could not be bent in a tight enough radius to meet the current training requirement. I realize that PEO STRI has the same specification in their CARTS solicitation; however I would urge you to consider a functional specification based on the training requirement instead requiring a product that cannot meet the current and evolving requirements.	  Answer:  The contractor's concerns are noted, and while valid in certain regards, they ignore the greater efficiencies gained by standardization and the numerous instances of railed solutions currently deployed and being deployed.  PEO STRI and TCM-L have agreed to the new rail specification for use on defined TC 25-8 ranges (TMO had nothing to do with the current standard).  Emerging requirements always present a challenge; the choice is either to standardize where possible, or pay for divergent, unique, and generally proprietary solutions across the board.  We choose the former.  <BR><BR>In the Use Case of Check Point training ranges; the solution vector could be to consider alternate manufacturing methods to manufacture the rails to the desired radius of curvature vice trying to bend them into shape.  The specification does not preclude greater radius of curvature of the rails.  Second, in the Use Case of Check Point training ranges, the use of Trackless Movers is aptly the best long term solution; such solutions would more accurately reflect the various conditions associated with Escalation of Force; i.e., adaptive behaviors based on training conditions and trainee actions.<BR><BR>End of Questions/Answers.  If the answers provided are not sufficient or you still have additional questions, please contact Jean Borowski, at jean.borowski@us.army.mil or call 407 380-4261.  The draft RFP will be released sometime in November 2008.  <BR><BR><BR>

<a href="mailto:wayne.miller6@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide answers to questions received by interested partiesThis is not a Request For Proposals.  This is a Request For Information (RFI) for market research purposes only in accordance with FAR Part 10, and it in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  The Government invites voluntary responses and will treat responses as information only for planning purposes.  Accordingly, respondents shall bear the cost (direct or indirect) of responding to this RFI.  Market research is being conducted primarily to identify the extent and nature of available commercial sources and to determine the range of prices.  There is no solicitation document available at this time, and a solicitation may be issued at a later date.  Information received from this RFI may or may not be used in developing an acquisition strategy and work statement or statement of objectives.  Interested parties must adequately mark proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.THE RESPONSE DATE IS OCTOBER 30, 2008, 4:30 PM, Central Standard Time1.	Are vendors, who do not respond to this RFI request, precluded from participation during the RFP competition?  		No.2.	Regarding pricing. The RFI states: "VA requests information about how you license/price your product-e.g. by user, by site". Does this mean that you are looking for actual pricing by site? Or are you just looking for the model of how we price? VA is looking for the model not the price.3.	Is there an existing purchased claims application that the VA is using that you are looking to integrate with or are you looking to purchase an application as part of this engagement?VA intends to purchase an application.  4.	Is there a limit to the number of pages that you would like for this initial response?  There is no limit to the number of pages.5.	Are there any formatting requirements for this initial response?  There are no formatting requirements.  6.	Is there an anticipated timeframe for a Solicitation release?  Currently this information is not available.7.	Is this a re-compete of an incumbent contract or a new requirement? If there is an incumbent, I would like to learn the name of the incumbent contract, the contract number, the expiration date, and the total value, including any and all options. No, this is a new requirement.8.	What is the average number of claims processed per month?Average Claims Processed per month (approximate): Enterprise Level: 700,000VISN Level: 32,000Site Level: 5,0009.	What is the maximum number of claims you have experience in a given month?Maximum number of claims any given month (approximate):Enterprise: 800,000VISN Level: 61,000Site Level: 33,00010.	Based on how the solicitation reads, it appears like you are looking for a Custom off the Shelf solution.  Is that correct or are you open to having a solution developed?VA intends to use an application, such as, a COTS (Commercial-Off-the-Shelf)  package.11.	Please clarify: Is this opportunity specifically a small business set aside or can large businesses prime? Currently this has not been determined.12.	Please confirm: The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541519 (Other Computer Related Services). The size standard is $25M. The statement refers to the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) determination of what constitutes a small business for a given NAICS code.  A small business size standard is numerical and represents the largest a concern can be and still be considered a small business.   Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 19 for additional information.  At this time a determination has not been made as to whether the opportunity will be specifically a small business set aside or if a large business can be a prime contractor.13.	Is the VHA seeking to acquire a systems-only solution, or is the VHA seeking to acquire a complete solution to include labor to perform the activities described within the RFI that support the systems solution.  Please clarify.VA is only seeking: product; implementation; and training.14.	Could you please clarify what the VA is looking for in item 4 under Additional Information? Reference to any existing government contract vehicles that you may hold.15.	Is the response to this solicitation to be sent via email? Multiple copies?  Via e-mail only (one copy).16.	Are you looking for a pre-existing package to perform the actions you were looking for or is this something a company may develop in a six (6) month timeframe? VA is seeking a pre-existing package, such as, COTS (Commercial-Off-the-Shelf).17.	Please confirm that you are asking for a software only solution and that you are not asking for claims processing services.  Yes.18.	The RFI says, "eliminate manual data entry" and "ensuredata is accurate and complete" - Are you looking for 100% accuracy from the OCR solution?  OCR depends upon image quality so a manual verification step will likely be needed to attain 100% or near 100% accuracy rates the RFI seems to require.  Please comment. Yes, we are looking for 100% accuracy.19.	Provide integrated claims scrubbing functionality - I read this to mean that you would like a solution that will "de-indentify" or "redact" sensitive information that doesn't or shouldn't be shared with outside or non-VA providers.  Is that correct? No, the claim scrubber requirement is to apply industry standard healthcare claim edits.20.	The RFI specifically says you are strongly encouraging small businesses to respond.  I am sure we qualify for that small business designation but where do I find the rules regarding this issue?  Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 19.  Information is also available on the following SBA web site: http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/indexguide/index.html  21.	Will there be a pre-bid meeting for this RFP? This is an RFI, not an RFP.  VA is conducting market research and the decision is will be made at a later date.22.	Is there a submittal date or deadline for vendor proposal information? Deadline for responses to the RFI is 10/30/08, 4:30 PM Central Standard Time.	23.	Would you prefer this information be emailed or mailed to you? 			An email is preferred.24.	Asked for clarification as to how this requirement is different from FBCS claims support being used by Austin Financial Services Center. Purchased Care is an interim solution.25.	What is the process [for responding to RFI]?Interested parties are advised to follow the instructions in the FedBizOpps notice (including supplements) and refer any questions to Wayne Miller whose contact information is provided in the notice.
