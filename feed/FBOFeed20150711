ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control
activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having
jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item
requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is
flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined
adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the
source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been
solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that
an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an
approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information
detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source
Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx
Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data
required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your
offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source
approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the
Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this
solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted
hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the
ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award
of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at:

<p>Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business social-economic set-aside, competitive or non-competitive method is possible, and to determine the availability of all qualified small business companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is  334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with associated business size standard 500 employees.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br />The Intramural Research Program (IRP) in the National Institute on Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is comprised of nine scientific laboratories, the Translational Gerontology Branch, and ten core facilities. The research program has three main focus areas: Neuroscience, Aging Biology and Translational Gerontology. IRP scientists conduct research in many different disciplines that range from basic science to clinical research and epidemiology. Medical problems, which typically affect older persons, are studied in depth using the tools of modern laboratory and clinical research, with a translational perspective.  The central focus of our research is understanding age-related changes in physiology and the ability to adapt to environmental stress.  This understanding is then applied to developing insight about the pathophysiology of age-related diseases.  The program seeks to understand the changes associated with healthy aging and to define the criteria for evaluating when changes should be considered  pathologic and require treatment.   Thus, in addition to study common age-related diseases, such as  Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, diabetes and cancer,, we also explore the determinants of healthy aging as possible targets for interventions aimed at improving health and quality of life in the older population at large.</p>
<p>The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (HANDLS) is a multidisciplinary, community-based, prospective longitudinal epidemiologic study examining the influences of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on the development of age-related health disparities among socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in Baltimore. This study investigates whether health disparities develop or persist due to differences in SES,<br />differences in race, or their interaction. This study is unique because it will assess over a 20-year period physical parameters as well as evaluate genetic, biologic, demographic,  sychosocial, and psychophysiological parameters of African American and white participants in higher and lower SES. The domains of the HANDLS study include: nutrition, cognition, biologic biomarkers, body composition and bone quality, psychophysiology, physical function and performance, sociodemographics, psychosocial, neighborhood environment and cardiovascular<br />disease. Utilizing data from these study domains will facilitate understanding the driving factors behind persistent black-white health disparities in overall longevity, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notice seeks responses from qualified sources that are capable of providing saliva kits as described in the salient characteristics herein that can achieve the following essential features needed for this potential requirement.</p>
<p>Product must have ability to collect DNA samples through a self-collection kit, which is designed to enable researchers to collect reliable saliva samples;</p>
<p>System must yield high-quality, high-quantity DNA from a saliva sample;</p>
<p>Product must be optimized to preserve and stabilize saliva samples for long-term storage at room temperature without DNA degradation;</p>
<p>DNA collected should be equivalent to DNA from blood;</p>
<p>Kits must be able to stand alone on a flat surface (desk or table top) on their own without the risk of falling over or spilling contents</p>
<p>Traditional DNA collection methods such as blood extraction are painful and can limit the number of individuals that are willing to participate in an epidemiological study, such as HANDLS. As methods are investiaged to increase compliance in the HANDLS study, it is<br />imperative that non-invasive specimen collection be a feasible and effective alternative.</p>

DNA self-collection kits can assist researchers in collecting DNA samples using a much less invasive method to traditional blood sample collection.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.<br /> <br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.
<p>Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business social-economic set-aside, competitive or non-competitive method is possible, and to determine the availability of all qualified small business companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is  334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with associated business size standard 500 employees.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) requires the purchase of the Agilent Technologies PlateLoc automated microplate sealer as well as the Agilent Technologies VSpin microplate centrifuge with Access2 plate loader.  These devices will be integrated onto the Wako system used for in-house cherry picking for follow ups on siRNA screens that have been completed.  NCATS DPI's ongoing process of cherry picking activities from siRNA screens avoids significant more money and time.</p>
<p>The plate sealer, centrifuge and loader are going to be integrated onto the Wako system used for automated cherry picking for follow ups to siRNA screening. The supply for this potential requirement shall be able to provide an on-adhesive seal using heat to 96, 384 and 1536 plates made of various materials (polypropylene, cyclic olefin and polystyrene for example). Versatile piece of equipment shall be used constantly to prevent evaporation of the particular reagents in the wells associated with a screen/experiment as well as to preserve precious chemical compounds, etc. The plate centrifuge is used to spin down the contents of the plate wells to prevent cross contamination/loss of sample and ensures more accurate pipetting of liquid as well.  The contents are pulled to the bottom of the well eliminating air gaps/bubbles.  The plate loader is necessary to load the microplates into the centrifuge buckets.</p>
<p>The supply for this potential requirement will be used to swap out existing currently used pieces of equipment manufactured by Agilent Technologies that was temporarily being used from other systems and groups.  Offerors to this Small Business Sources Sought notice shall indicate their compatibility to provide equipment that can be compatibilly used in replacement of the currently used existing equipment, such as installation of drivers etc. Positions are already taught for the robotic arm in the Wako system and this system was designed around these particular pieces of equipment and their footprints.</p>
<p>Specifically, the NCATS DPI requires the following:</p>
<p>One (1) Microplate Sealer; and</p>
<p>One (1) Microplate Centrifuge with plate loader.</p>
<p>The microplate sealer will be used to seal the 200 source plates which are currently cherry picked from in any given run as well as the destination plates.  The Microplate Centrifuge with plate loader will be used to spin down the source plates after they are thawed from -80C to prevent cross contamination/loss of sample and ensure more accurate pipetting when cherry picking.  The centrifuge requires the plate loader to load the plates into the centrifuge buckets.</p>
<p>Delivery of of this potential requirement must be within 30 days of any order placement to the NCATS government facility located at 9800 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850</p>

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>Procedures for commercial vehicle access to military installations are varied.   To enter the installation, the Contractor should thoroughly comply with the access procedures of a respective installation. The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the access procedures enforced by each military installation.  The Contractor shall completely coordinate with the military installations and the delivery point of contacts. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of a warranty.  Markings shall include (i) a brief statement that a warranty exists, (ii) the substance of the warranty, (iii) its duration, and (iv) who to notify if the supplies are found to be defective. <BR> <BR>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST YOU, AND WILL HELP TO EXPEDITE PAPERWORK AND PAYMENT.
     a. Only one delivery will be accepted against each line item.  Backorders will NOT be accepted on individual line items.     b. Deliver on or before date specified.  Deliveries will be accepted Monday through Friday (except Holidays) from 7:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. to Block 15 of the Purchase Order.  Notify the individual in Block 16 of any delay encountered (due to strikes, factory backorders, etc.)  and give revised delivery date if possible.     c. Mark outside of all cartons.  Put packing list inside cartons.  Show the order number assigned, the PR number shown at the end of each item, and the quantity shipped.  All items will be identified by the part number by attached tag and/or stamped identification.     d. On direct shipments, have the supplier or manufacturer cite our order number on packages.  This eliminates delay caused by trying to determine the firm awarded the original order. <BR> <BR>Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the contractor shall obtain any necessary licenses and permits, give all notices, and comply with any applicable Federal, State, County, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations in connection with this award. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall not make news releases or otherwise provide information relative to the performance of this contract or information relative to any incident occurring on JBLM without prior approval of the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC>QUESTION FROM A VENDOR:  6/23/2015    <br>      <br>   In the specs provided, you refer to required voltages of 240/208V, and 480V.    <br>    quote mark both voltages. quote mark   Is it your intent to have a generator mounted selector    <br>   switch for voltage, or is a re-connectible 12 lead alternator  acceptable for    <br>   differing voltage requirements?     <br>   Also, I see no reference to automatic transfer switches, which generally    <br>   control the auto exercise function.  Will they be in a separate solicitation?   <br>      <br>   ANSWER FROM TECHNICAL POC: 6/23/2015   <br>      <br>   The generators shall have a mounted switch on them with a terminal panel for connecting to an outside load, all required connections should have been made    <br>   at the factory and be available to us at the generator panel and marked.  We    <br>   have existing automatic transfer switches.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to correct the Institute Center at NIH for which this Sources Sought notice is being released. The "National Institute of Aging" and any reference thereof shall be replaced with the "National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences" (NCATS) Intramural program. The location of service to be provided for this potential requirement is identified as: 9800 Medical Drive; Rockville, MD. All other terms and provisions remain unchanged. <br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business social-economic set-aside, competitive or non-competitive method is possible, and to determine the availability of all qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is  811219-Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance with associated small business size standard of $20.5 million.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br />The subject potential requirement consists of providing a service plan and preventive maintenance on existing government-owned laboratory equipment manufactured by and previously purchased from Molecular Device, Inc. The required service includes coverage on two (2) ImageXpress Micro XL imaging platforms currently in use at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), Intramural Research Programs. Subject pieces of equipment are located at the Biomedical Research Center at 251 Bayview Blvd in Baltimore, MD 21225 and used in the Tox21 and Trans-NIH RNAi intiaitves.</p>
<p>The Molecular Devices lmageXpress Micro is a sophisticated imaging latform capable of acquiring and analyzing cellular images in high throughput. For example, we have used this system in RNAi group to interrogate genes that are important for the infection of human cells by several different viruses, genes associated with aberrant replication of DNA, and genes associated with rescuing the expression of proteins down-regulated in the context of certain rare diseases. In Tox21 group this system is used to develop several High Content Assays indicative of toxicity of drugs and chemicals like Phospholipidosis, Micronuclei, rH2AX, LC3 etc.</p>
<p>The Trans-NIH RNAi initiative conducts high-throughput siRNA screens in collaboration with intramural investigators. siRNAs down-regulate target genes possessing corresponding sequence complementarity. In this way, we can interrogate a specific gene's function in the context of any biology we can assay. The initiative's work encompasses assay development, screening, and initial follow-up.</p>
<p>Tox21 is an effort to use the quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) approach to profile a collection of 10,000 compounds composed of environmental chemicals and drugs approved for human and animal use against a battery of cellular and biochemical assays for their potential to perturb biological pathways that may result in toxicity. Such a data set could be used to create a systematic view of the biological network and the interactions therein via its response to chemical perturbations. To achieve this goal, a set of assays needs to be selected or designed to measure targets that encompass all pathways that are relevant to toxicity</p>
<p>The purpose of the potential requirement is to obtain preventive maintenance service coverage agreements for the existing ImageXpress Micro XL imaging platforms manufactured by Molecular Device, Inc. Eligible sources shall indicate their capability to provide the services hereby stated:</p>
<p>This contract shall include no less than one (1) preventive maintenance inspection during the contract period. Service shall be performed by a factory trained Field Service representative.

The contractor shall also furnish all required replacement parts at no additional cost to the Government, with the exception of consumable parts. Parts shall be new or remanufactured to original equipment specifications.</p>
<p>Contractor shall be required to provide written progress reports in achieving this statement of work during the period of performance. The original documentation shall be provided by the vendor to show completed service on the instrument and the technical progress achieved in written format to the COR.</p>
<p><br />Contractor shall also indicate the ability to provide unlimited number of demand on-site service visits with a maximum 72-hour response; parts, labor, and travel at no expense; Priority status for technical support inquiries; One (1) Scheduled Preventative Maintenance visit per performance period; Factory-certified replacement parts included; Software updates and notifications and patches includeing applicable source code; any subscriptions to support Online Technical Resources.</p>
