<DESC>The Airframe Digital Twin (ADT) Spiral 1 program seeks to make the Aircraft Structural Integrity program (ASIP) more proactive by increasing the accuracy of the structural prognoses developed within the Individual Aircraft Tracking (IAT) program for each Mission Design Series (MDS). More accurate prognoses can only be developed with higher fidelity flight loads data, more realistic structural analysis models than currently used and a concerted effort to quantify and reduce modeling uncertainty over time.
<p>The ADT Spiral 1 program seeks to augment IAT programs through the fusion of (1) usage/environment data from on-board sensors, (2) maintenance data collected from the field and depot, and (3) data collected as part of the structural development and certification program within high fidelity, physics-based structural prognostic models.</p>
<p>The key innovation within this program is the integration of three key technologies into an improved IAT procedure: (1) probabilistic structural reliability analysis (PSRA), (2) on-board and in-situ damage detection, and (3) advanced flight loads simulations.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this effort is to develop and demonstrate a Prognostic and Probabilistic Individual Aircraft Tracking (P2IAT) methodology that provides better prognostic capability for fatigue cracking of metallic structures. The P2IAT approach will integrate advanced flight loads simulation, airframe structural stress analysis, fatigue life analysis, probabilistic structural reliability analysis, and uncertainty quantification methods. The methodology will use higher fidelity loads derived from the flight history of the specific aircraft than the current IAT approach to achieve better prognostic results. It will be modular so that the method can be easily applied to different MDS and new analysis models can be readily integrated. Uncertainty in input parameters and output variables for the P2IAT algorithms will be described by probability distributions. Confidence bounds shall be placed on both the input and output probability distributions. Criteria for when to perform structural inspections will be established based on the probability of an event occurring (e.g., a crack of a specified size existing, probability of failure, etc.). The contractor will demonstrate the effectiveness of the P2IAT approach by tracking fatigue damage in two full-scale structural experiments that simulate flight-by-flight loading. These experiments will be conducted by the government, but will be planned jointly with the contractor.</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207 (c) (15) (ii); all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Qualification Requirements:  Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>*******ATTENTION*******ALL FORMAL COMMUNICATION RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION MUST BE DIRECTED TO:  Rebekah Massey, Contract Specialist, email: rebekah.j.massey@us.army.mil.  No telephone calls will be accepted.*************** <br>  <br> This requirement is for the purchase of 118 ARC-201D radios (National Stock Number 5821-01-423-8827) in support of Product Manager Aviation Maintenance Equipment (PM AME).  This requirement will be solicited using other than full and open competition and negotiated on a sole source basis in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  This acquisition is restricted to ITT Exelis, Inc., Cage Code 31550, since the ARC-201D is the only fully qualified SINCGARS capable radio that can meet the Government's required delivery schedule for installation on the UH-60M and CH-47F aircraft.

<p>8. The solicitation document contains information that has been designated as "Militarily Critical Technical Data." Only businesses that have been certified by the Department of Defense, United States/Canada Joint Certification Office, and have a valid requirement may have a copy of the solicitation document. All requests for copies of the solicitation document must include a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. To obtain certification, contact:</p>

All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>(X) The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<p>(X) This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: Transdigm, Inc. / CAGE 81883.</p>

<CONTACT>Ryan Pregot
<DESC>The Department of Interior, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) in Herndon, Virginia intends to negotiate and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to HUBzero Platform for Scientific Collaboration. For the following service/product: A critical element of the NCIP is to establish a sustainable online resource for the NCI and the larger cancer community to better disseminate and support cancer research digital computing capabilities. This platform shall serve bench and computational scientists as well as educators to allow comprehensive access to data, tools and other resources in a collaborative environment. This requires that the research community be able to access and deliver interactive tools and workflows via an ordinary web-browser. The tools and capabilities must be deployable without having to develop or rewrite special code for the web and the users computes must be run and visualized without having to reserve time on a supercomputer/wait for a batch job to engage. An individual registered user with little or no informatics resources/expertise should have the ability to test a tool, and share their datasets. There is also a requirement to support open source development and enable tool developers and other computational biologists to directly interact with and establish communities with the bench scientists (end users of the tools to answer specific hypotheses driven questions and drive biological projects). The community requires a platform that supports upload of new resources to serve as a market place to access, share and learn from each others tools and data. The resources should be categorized/tagged to enable easy browsing and/or search capability and most importantly support a self-service model. To accelerate community/team research, there is a requirement for the desired cyber-infrastructure to appropriately leverage and seamlessly integrate social-media and crowd-sourcing techniques in the platform to support team science. Wikis and blogs supported should be integrated with the larger system. Users should have the ability to restrict group/community size for private collaboration. Users should be able to rate resources and other feedback mechanisms should be built in to gather new product/service ideas, requirements and feature requests for current tools. The ratings and citations for resources combined with tracked web statistics should provide a true measure of the value and success of the resources and serve as evaluation criteria. The required cyber-infrastructure must be open-source and have an established community of developers supporting it. The platform itself must be scalable to address the anticipated data volume, compute power, large number of (over 200,000) users and concurrent sessions (more than 10,000). The system should support large (> 50 terabytes) of data storage and be flexible to allow computes and storage in open-source grids and clouds. The platform should meet not only the federally required systems security requirements but must also address the more stringent requirements for sensitive electronic patient and outcomes data. The platform must be available allow for migration to NCIs own hardware at a future date. There are a limited number of scientific  or research platforms that provide one or more of the requirements identified; however,  there is only one that provides all mandatory requirements  and that can be  sustained to support scientific collaboration to accelerate research. This is the HUBzero platform. This proven product has been successfully demonstrated by the nearly forty hubs implemented by diverse scientific domains.  The project envisions the use of the HUBzero Platform for scientific collaboration to create an online collaboratory" to support cancer research. The hub will contain an electronic library of tools, along with data sets, community forums, seminars, tutorials, teaching materials and other resources contributed by the community for the community. The order will be issued on behalf of the National Cancer Institute. AQD will use procedures that provide for issuance of the order on the basis of other than full and open competition that are authorized by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2). The services needed are highly specialized and market research indicates that the services appear to not be otherwise available to the government. This notice is not a formal solicitation. This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No task order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information related to the potential availability of other sources that can fulfill this requirement must be received by the POC listed below no later than 1PM eastern time on Tuesday, January 21 , 2013,  at Ryan_Pregot@nbc.gov. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is soliciting proposals on a full and open, competitive basis to award a contract for the "NIDDK Data Repository."<br />
<p><br />The NIDDK Data Repository stores data from large clinical studies, including data associated with stored samples, and acts as the Data Coordinating Center for the NIDDK Central Repositories. Storing and allowing subsequent use of biological materials and associated data collected in clinical studies is one way for the NIDDK to meet its responsibility to maximize the value of these studies. The NIDDK's Central Repositories' collection of the biosamples and associated clinical, diagnostic, genotypic, pedigree structure and/or other data is a resource that advances the development of diagnostic and treatment tools for many diseases. The NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories, which are separately supported, house biological materials collected in large clinical studies. The NIDDK Data Repository stores the data from these large studies, including data associated with the stored biosamples, and acts as the Data Coordinating Center for the NIDDK Central Repositories. The NIDDK Data Repository acts as a central coordinating entity and facilitates efficient distribution of data and samples. As an archive and distributor of highly usable legacy datasets, the NIDDK Data Repository allows re-analysis of these data and, where relevant, of specific biosamples, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in the original funded studies.<br /><br />Towards the above ends, the objective of this acquisition is to continue the NIDDK Data Repository to perform the following tasks in a highly efficient, rapid, secure, and cost-effective manner:</p>
<p>(1) receive and test the validity of electronic databases from completed studies, and maintain the stored databases; (2) maintain stored databases; (3) curate data to derive study metadata and descriptive variables that permit Web-based searches of the entire inventory using keywords and other features of samples and datasets; (4) carry out activities to support cross-listing of sample inventory with other national and international sample catalogues; (5) assist study coordinating centers and the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories in setting up labeling systems to cross-reference samples and associated data; (6) maintain a searchable, up to date central inventory of samples kept at the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories, and provide inventory reporting structures for individual studies; (7) create and maintain a searchable inventory of informed consents associated with each sample; (8) create and maintain a website for all of the NIDDK Central Repositories; (9) provide timely and informative analyses of databases in response to researcher inquiries about availability of appropriate samples and data; and (10) provide a system for requesting databases and/or samples, and or distribution of databases and/or stored samples to investigators granted access by the Project Officer, including a Web-based application and application review system.</p>
<p>The information systems, consulting, and database archiving tasks required in this procurement are highly technical and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment. The data from each study represent the efforts of hundreds of investigators to improve the public health through biomedical research, and the voluntary participation of thousands of patients and family members. The data and samples represent taxpayer funded work by the National Institutes of Health and it is important that these be made available to qualified researchers for the public benefit. The data cannot be replaced without great expense and effort, and, therefore, it is essential that they be protected from loss, damage or misuse. The Contractor's project director must have extensive experience in successful database management. The Contractor's staff must be highly trained to work with, maintain, and analyze numerous databases, including those in Oracle and other DBMS's. Because all these studies contain data from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical issues involved in handling subject data. Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.</p>
<p>A cost-reimbursement type contract using NAICS code 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, is contemplated. NLM intends to award a five year contract, with a base year plus four option years, beginning on or about July 1, 2013. FAR Part 15 procedures will be used to compete this procurement with full and open competition. The request for proposals is expected to be released on or about January 29, 2013 at the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons
Division (NAWCWD) intends to procure and award, on other than full and open competition basis in accordance with FAR
6.302-1, a Fixed Price Single Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with DRS Signal Solutions of Columbia, Maryland with a minimum order of two and maximum of six SI-8646 Quad Channel receivers. Anticipated award is April 2013 or earlier.

DRS Signals Solutions is the only known provider of the SI-8646 Quad Channel Receiver.  The SI-8646 is the only receiver that meets the Governments minimum requirements.  The current generation of receiver/signal processing system that was built by the Signals Warfare Branch uses an advanced digital receiver that is approximately 5 years old.
 China Lake has been tasked with developing a follow-on system that has improved receiver technical performance, a broader frequency range, wider IF processing bandwidth, and network- based command-and-control and data output. The new system will be based on a modular distributed approach, where the receivers can be remotely located from the signal processing elements. This represents a break from the current system architecture, where the receivers are "embedded" in a standard computer architecture and communicate with the processing elements through the computer backplane.

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firms believing they can fulfill the requirement of providing the SI-8646 Quad Channel receiver may submit a written response, which shall be considered by the agency.
  The written response shall reference solicitation number N68936-13-R-0025 and clearly show the firm's capability, background, experience and assets necessary to perform the required work mentioned above without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability, and delivery of the product.  Written response shall be submitted by e-mail to suellen.jackson@navy.mil or mailed to Commander, Code 254120D (Suellen Jackson), NACAIRWARCENWPNSDIV, 429 E. Bowen Rd. Mail Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108 within 15 days from the Notice date.

<DESC>This procurement is for a multiple award construction contract (MACC) and is being advertised as a set-aside for Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business (FAR 52.219-3) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) (FAR 52.219-27) concerns. This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the best value, price and other factors considered.
 This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, renovation, and repair, primarily by design-build or secondarily by design-bid-build, of general building construction at various locations within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility (AOR) including but not limited to California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.
 Types of projects may include, but are not limited to:  administration buildings, school buildings, hospitals, auditoriums, fire stations, gymnasiums, office buildings, hangars, laboratories, and parking structures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, and the annual size standard is $33.5 million. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $99,000,000. Task orders will range between $3,000,000 and $9,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract.
 The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  Phase One:  Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, and Factor 3 - Past Performance; Phase Two:  Factor 4 - Safety; Factor 5 - Technical Solution, Factor 6 - Energy and Sustainable Design, and Factor 7 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).
 Source Selection procedures will be used, and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. No site visit will be held, and no formal pre-proposal conference will be conducted. THE SOLICITATION AND PRE-PROPOSAL PRESENTATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP and pre-proposal presentation will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about January 29, 2013. No hard copies will be provided. The pre-proposal presentation will be uploaded for viewing as an attachment to the RFP.

<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistic Center San Diego intends to issue a sole source purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 to Allen-Vanguard Inc., 103 Tulloch Drive, Ogdensburg, NY 13669.  The proposed contract action is for EOD9 bomb suits, helmets, and visors for Explosive Ordnance Disposal Expeditionary Support Unit One (EOD ESU-1). COMNECC Instruction 4423.2 dictates that only items in the EOD ESU-1 Table of Allowances (TOA) are authorized for procurement and the components of each suit are designed to be interchangeable and to fit with the existing items.  The J04 EOD TOA currently lists the EOD9 bomb suit and its components as the only authorized bomb suit for Navy EOD forces.  Thus the purchase of these suits is only possible through Allen-Vanguard as the gear is proprietary and only available through this manufacturer.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.
  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.  The NAICS code is 314999 and the applicable business size is 500 employees.  Interested parties shall submit information that indicates their ability to satisfy this requirement via e-mail.  Requests must include company name, address, POC name, telephone number, CAGE Code, DUNS number, NAICS code, applicable business size, and Tax ID number.
  Responses are due by Monday, January 28th, 2013, 1:00 PM, Pacific Standard Time, via email. 

If no responses are received, FLCSD will proceed with the sole source award.

<DESC>The United States Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) has a  requirement for The Joint Program Committee 1 (JPC-1), Medical Training and Health Information Systems (MTHIS) Research Program, in coordination with the US Army Medical Research & Materiel Command's (USAMRMC) Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) for research and development (R&D) of an Advanced Modular Manikin (AMM). This anticipated solicitation seeks to advance the state of the art in medical simulation based training. It is anticipated that the core AMM system will be state of the art, modular, and relatively autonomous. It will serve as a core platform that allows scaling from a simple, to a vastly more capable, unit using future commercial upgrades ( quote mark peripherals quote mark ) that can be obtained from a variety of potential sources. The intent is that the AMM be a platform upon which future technologies can reside through development of advanced peripherals through other efforts. It is envisioned that the advanced modular manikin be compatible with a wide array of peripherals and/or extensions leveraged with open-source / open-standard physical attachments, supply (electrical/fluid) connections and communications links. This broad AMM platform to be developed should have the ability to host capabilities that do not yet exist but that are anticipated to be developed within the next five to ten years. Creation of the AMM platform will allow for a usable manikin system that can incorporate future advances, from a variety of sources, easily into military medical training.  This requirement will include Phase 1 for development of initial capabilities and prototypes with an option for Phase 2 for the delivery of an advanced working prototype.  The initial period of performance is expected to be one year to eighteen months.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued in March 2013.  This is a pre-solicitation notice only.   <br>  <br> Any questions concerning this notice shall be submitted in writing to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Robert Doan at robert.doan@us.army.mil or the Contracting Officer, Ms. Pamela Nevels at pamela.nevels@us.army.mil. <br>  <br>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 660-14-101 - Electrical Panel Corrections at the George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center (VAMC), Salt Lake City, Utah.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. 

The Salt Lake City VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to provide all A/E services for Electrical Panel Corrections in Building 14 and Building 1.  The work will include correcting circuitry and panel room deficiencies as well as construct electrical towers in order to separate the electrical system of the main patient care building, building 14, into three zones so that each zone can be isolated electrically from each other. The building is currently separated into zones A, B, and C and the electrical towers will match this zoning for the electrical system. As a result of these new electrical towers that will house new electrical panel rooms, the existing violations per NFPA 70, National Electrical Code, will be corrected due to replacing the existing deficient electrical panel rooms. These deficiencies that will be corrected by constructing new panel rooms include panel clearance non-compliance, replacement of old GE panels, old Square D switchboards, and old GE switchgear as well as replacement of circa 1980 transformers that were installed directly under panels which is a National Electrical Code violation as well.

The AE firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired construction work.   Microsoft Project scheduling and management software will be used by both the A&E and Contractors to allow for regular tracking of schedules and work by the VAMC.   Schedules with MS Project will be regularly sent to the COR upon project initiation and whenever significant changes occur in the schedule.  All work must be designed within a construction cost range of $500,000 to $1,000,000.  The AE will provide an initial estimate of cost to perform the above work and will design only those items that can be provided within the cost limitation. Submission requirements are the initial estimate and preliminary design submission, a 50% design submission, and a 95% design submission.  The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the AE to minimize impact of the construction.  The AE will provide documents at each submission as indicated in the statement of work.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do, type in 330 in the "Find A Form" block and click on search. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330.  Interested firms should submit one (1) copy of their current SF 330 no later than 12:00 PM Mountain Standard Time (MST) February 12, 2013 to andrew.stigen@va.gov. The emailed file shall not exceed 5MB in total.  

Offerors will be evaluated on the following criteria:
(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;
(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials;
(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;
(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;
(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and
(6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
(7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.
(8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team
Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement <br> For <br> MK17 Inert Blasting Cap <br>  <br> Solicitation Number:  W52P1J-13-R-0049 <br>  <br> The purpose of this Sources Sought announcement is to identify interested sources for the MK17 Inert Blasting Cap.  This announcement is in support of Market Research performed by the United States Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, to determine interest in a planned Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 procurement for the MK17 Inert Blasting Cap.  The U.S. Government (USG) is interested in consolidating the procurement of this MK17 Inert Blasting Cap with the Blasting Cap family of items (issued via separate sources sought, Solicitation Number W52P1J-13-R-0045).  Therefore, if market research supports the planned consolidation in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 207.170-3, the MK17 Inert Blasting Cap will be solicited in USG FY14 with the Blasting Cap family of items.  The Blasting Cap family of items includes:  M6 Electric Blasting Cap, M7 Non-Electric Blasting Cap, and M30 Inert Blasting Cap. <br>  <br> Item Description: <br>  <br> DODIC MP16, NSN 1375-01-547-0039, Cap, Blasting, Practice MK17 Mod 2, Inert. The MK17 is the Inert Version of the Navy's MK18 Electric Blasting Cap.  The MK17 shares the same physical characteristics of the design of the Army's M6 Electric Blasting Cap in terms of the cup, rubber plug, crimp, wire, and spool. <br>  	Assembly Dwg 53711-8215725, Packaging Dwg 53711-8324644. <br>  	Cup Maximum Diameter= 0.247; Cup Maximum Length= 2.37 in.; Approx Explosive Weight= 0g <br>  	Two blue 12-foot lead wires extend through a rubber plug assembly in the open end of the cup. Two circumferential crimps secure the plug assembly in the cup that must withstand a pull test of 10 lbs for 5 seconds. The inert blasting cup consists of an aluminum alloy cup with two thru-holes to indicate inert. The aluminum alloy cup's exterior surface is coated in blue enamel. <br>  <br> The manufacturing process of the MK17 Inert Blasting Cap encompasses, but is not limited to, a crimping process and a thru-hole drilling process.  For different stages of the manufacturing process, special inspection and test equipment is required to ensure that the final product complies with USG requirements.  The Contractor will be required to successfully conduct First Article Acceptance and Lot Acceptance tests on the item.  The MK17 Inert Blasting Cap is procured to an USG Technical Data Package (TDP).  The entire TDP will not be provided in support of this market research; however top-level and packaging drawings identified above are available for interested sources to review.  The drawings are Distribution Statement D, which means distribution is authorized to the Department of Defense and U.S. DOD Contractors only.  Interested contractors that would like to obtain the top-level and packaging drawings must submit a written request to the POC identified below.  The written request must include the company's cage code and Joint Certification Number (JCP) (see http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/).  Interested contractors will also be required to execute and return a Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement (NDA) prior to obtaining the Blasting Cap Technical Data.  This NDA will be provided by the POC upon the written request.  <br>  <br> Requirements: <br> As stated above, the USG is interested in consolidating procurement of this MK17 Inert Blasting Cap with the Blasting Cap family of items.  Therefore, it is anticipated that a consolidated Request for Proposal for the Blasting Cap family of items would include the anticipated MK17 Inert requirements.  A resultant Contract award would be issued for USG FY 14 requirements as a base quantity of the M6 Electric Blasting Cap, M7 Non-Electric Blasting Cap, and MK17 Inert Blasting Cap.  Options would be included for USG FYs 15-18 anticipated and possible unplanned requirements, to include the MK17 Inert requirements.  USG currently anticipated requirements are as follows for the MK17 Inert Blasting Cap: <br>  <br> USG FY 14:  15,000 each MK17 Inert Blasting Caps <br>   <br> USG FYs 15-16:  Currently no planned requirements for MK17 Inert Blasting Cap <br>  <br> USG FY17:  3,900 each MK17 Inert Blasting Caps <br>  <br> USG FY 18:  Currently no planned requirements for MK17 Inert Blasting Cap <br>  <br> Responses: <br> Interested companies are invited to indicate their interest by providing the USG the following information:  a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of the facilities, personnel experience, quality system, and past manufacturing experience) and their availability.  If a respondent does not have adequate resources (facilities, technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, then they must be able to demonstrate their ability to obtain those resources without significant delay.  Any potential key subcontractors should also be addressed, by indicating which key components or processes would be subcontracted and providing a brief summary of potential key component and/or process subcontractors.  Industry respondents are also invited to indicate to the Government whether the MK17 Inert Blasting Cap requirements can be met by available commercial or non-developmental items.  Respondents are encouraged to address the feasibility of or alternatives to the USG's preferred lead-time of 300 days after award for First Article Test (FAT) completion and report submission, and 390 days after award for production deliveries to commence.  Additionally, respondents should indicate a Minimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) and whether the USG's planned quantities as stated within this announcement meet or exceed the MPQ.      <br>  <br> Consolidation: <br> In accordance with DFARS 207.170-3, the USG will evaluate industry responses received in response to this sources sought announcement to assist in determining whether consolidation of contract requirements (with the Blasting Cap family of items) is necessary and justified.  This includes a comparison of the benefits of possible alternative contracting approaches.  To assist the USG in making a proper determination, Industry respondents are requested to address the two potential contracting approaches, of either procuring the MK17 Inert Blasting Cap individually, or consolidating the procurement of the MK17 Inert Blasting Cap with the Blasting Cap family of items.  These alternatives should be addressed in terms of:  (1) Cost/Price; (2) Quality; (3) Production lead-time; (4) Terms and Conditions; (5) any other areas where significant differences may exist. <br>  <br> Interested companies are requested to provide an FY14 Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) price for 15,000 each MK17 Inert Blasting Caps; please include a separate ROM for First Article Test.  If necessary and in support of the consolidation evaluation, respondents may provide separate ROMs for each potential contracting approach.   <br>  <br> The NAICS code for this item is 325920 with a business size standard of 750 employees.  Please indicate your business size in your response.  Respondents are requested to provide minimum and maximum monthly production quantities and identify the remaining capacity for simultaneous production of all the Blasting Cap family of items (and if manufacturing resources are shared with other items/production lines).  Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract resulting from a planned solicitation for these items.  Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration by visiting:  https://www.acquisition.gov.   <br>  <br> This sources sought announcement is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an official Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the USG.  Industry responses to this sources sought announcement will not represent binding offers, and the USG cannot accept an industry response to form a binding contract.  The USG intends to use any information submitted in response to this request to develop an acquisition strategy for future requirements of this item.  The USG will hold all information submitted in a confidential status. <br>  <br> Interested parties must submit a response no later than 13 February 2013 in order to be considered in the development of acquisition strategy for this item.  Electronic submission is acceptable and preferred.  Address all responses to:  U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island; ATTN:  CCRC-AM (B. Howe); 1 Rock Island Arsenal; Rock Island, IL  61299-8000; Email:  Brittany.m.howe.civ@mail.mil.

Neither Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the PM FSS will take procurement action in this matter.  <br>   <br> BACKGROUND: The remote locations of base camps create significant challenges for logistics support of combat operations, in particular bagged ice production.  These base camps are heavily dependent on large, long-distance truck convoys whose cargo is dominated by water and bulk fuel.  Convoy routes through unsecured areas are frequently hazardous, and transport is always expensive.  PM FSS is in the process of initiating dramatic steps toward rapidly improving the logistics support required to establish and operate base camps.  Information received from this RFI may be used to help identify technical solutions suitable for rapidly enhancing ice making capability at base camp operations.  Information received may ultimately result in requests for equipment manufacturers to demonstrate their ice production capabilities at no cost or risk to the Government as early as May 2013. <br>  <br> PURPOSE: PM FSS is interested in understanding the currently available capabilities that could enhance the bagged ice need sustainability of remote operating bases engaged in combat operations.  This RFI focuses on technologies and equipment that addresses energy ice production systems to meet the ice production need of 3,600lbs per day.  Technologies of interest are those that would most effectively produce and automatically bag ice in support of a base a base camp supporting 600 personnel with 300 additional personnel located forward.  Information is requested in the form of brief product descriptions.  The current concepts of use for these Ice Making Systems will be for extended periods of time are to replace convoy provided ice supply in operational theaters when deployments. Primary functional uses of these systems will be as ice production systems to automatically produce the ice and deliver in sealed bag.    <br>  <br> PLAN: The PM FSS is seeking Companies or Government agencies to demonstrate Ice Making Systems at Ft. Devens, MA starting on or after 20 May 2013 for a minimum of 90 days through December 2013.  Due to limited field space available to have companies demonstrate their products, PM FSS reserves the right to select only a small number of potential solutions being offered from the responses received.  PM FSS plans on investigating each selected Ice Making System for ice production capability, ability to meet the requirements of producing and bagging ice and operational efficiency.  Each company selected will receive an independent PM FSS assessment of their commercial product only.  All costs associated with shipping, installation, take-down, re-installation, and removal of a company's Ice Making System or component thereof, from site shall be borne by the company.  PM FSS will supply material handling equipment (MHE) to off load assets from transportation means to ground on site.  PM FSS will assign a date and location for the assessment which will be coordinated with the company. <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS SOUGHT <br>  <br> Ice Making Systems solutions with capability to produce ice, bag and seal and store ice are sought to provide the capability for Base Camps own organic ice supply.  Mature technologies and products that can provide the following capabilities are of interest: <br>  <br> 1.  Ice Making Systems to produce 3,600lbs Threshold/7,200lbs Objective of cubed, tube or nugget ice and bag ice in 10lb  to 20lb sealed bags and store 1,200lbs at one time within system.  <br> 2.  Provide a system capable of operating in operational environments up to 130 deg F.  <br> 3.

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>The Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rail Inspections, LLC</em> of San Diego, CA, for the execution of a Rail-NT Prototype Demonstration and Comprehensive Evaluation project. A Rail-NT prototype was developed by the University of California-San Diego (UCSD), under FRA research and development grant. This prototype uses nonlinear ultrasonic guided waves propagating in the rail web to determine an accurate measurement of the rail neutral temperature without the need of a zero reference stress. This innovative technique may have the potential to be a breakthrough in addressing the perennial challenge of in-situ measurement of rail neutral temperature and may effectively address track accidents due to thermally induced stresses which have been a long standing challenge for the railroad industry. The proposed contractor, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rail Inspections, LLC,</em> is the exclusive UCSD licensee for this technology, and therefore, the only entity that can legally transition this unique technique from the University to the railroad industry. Because of railroad safety related urgency of the project, award of contract is anticipated within 45 days of the publication of this announcement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The contractor is to fabricate four (4) fully functional Rail-NT ruggedized prototype units, similar to a previously demonstrated prototype, to be delivered prior to the heat season of July and August 2013 for in-field rail neutral temperature measurement testing. Three units will be installed at cooperating railroad sites, and one unit to be held as a spare for use if needed by the Government. These prototypes are expected to meet the following required criteria:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="1">
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Accuracy: Rail NT measurement of &plusmn;5 &deg;F,</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Calibration: No need for calibration for different rail sizes, different rail manufacturers, different steel microstructures,&nbsp;or different residual stress distributions (i.e. no need for "baseline" measurement), </li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Reference Value: No need for a reference value of stress (i.e. no need to measure the zero-stress condition of a given rail), </li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Rail Support: No influence of rail supports or tie-to-tie variation i.e. system must work equally well on wood ties and concrete ties and with any type of rail fastening system, and </li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Installation: The system can be permanently mounted as a wayside system or temporarily mounted as a portable system but must not interfere with normal revenue trains, thus avoiding traffic interruption.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>The contractor shall provide all the labor, materials, and equipment needed for project execution, for the envisioned comprehensive evaluation of Rail-NT prototype, to include the preparation of a final report documenting to be published for availability to the general public, in accordance with the FRA R&amp;D policy on technical information sharing. It is estimated that about 1200 professional labor hour will be required for prototypes final design, fabrication, field installation, data acquisition, data analysis, final report preparation, and other related project execution activities. The related activities include training FRA and/or FRA designated technical support contractor personnel on the system operation and maintenance in conjunction with its inclusion in the FRA R&amp;D Equipment Inventory.</p>
<p>The overall result of this project is anticipated to be a significant advancement in safety related railroad technology that will aid in the fulfillment of the FRA agency mandate.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial supply and/or service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. This is a Request For Quote (RFQ) and the solicitation number is F2VUJ02353AC01. This acquisition is 100% set aside for small businesses. The 6th Contracting Squadron (6 CONS), MacDill AFB, Florida, requires the following: Brand Name or Equal Security Event Logging and Maintenance software license upgrade.

<p>CLIN 3001 - Provide maintenance and support of software to include any upgrades; provide 24/7 customer service with response within 4 hours. Period of Performance: 1 Oct 15 to 30 Sept 16</p>
<p>Please provide a BRAND NAME OR EQUAL quote. If an or equal quote is submitted, the proposal will be sent to the technical advisor for compatibility verification. ANY OFFEROR PROVIDING AN OR EQUAL PRODUCT SHOULD DESCRIBE THOROUGHLY HOW THEIR PRODUCT MEETS ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS LISTED BELOW. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL MAKE THAT OFFEROR NON-RESPONSIVE AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.</p>
<p>Below is a description of the requirement and license necessary.</p>
<p>USSOCOM has invested in Splunk to satisfy log aggregation and requires a license increase of 60 GB for an aggregate of 250 GB. This requirement will be satisfied by upgrading the existing Splunk Enterprise Perpetual License by 60 GB for a total of 250 GB with the accompanying annual Splunk support with option for renewal each fiscal year. Other proposed solutions that are considered similar "or equal" to Splunk Enterprise Perpetual Licensing may satisfy this requirement only if the proposed solution can be integrated with the existing Splunk Enterprise Perpetual Licensing for an aggregate of 250 GB. Proposals offering an entirely new solution may satisfy this requirement only if licensing, hardware, software, implementation, installation, training and travel required to get the proposed solution up and operational at HQ USSOCOM and four other locations (Coronado, CA; Hurlburt Field, FL; Fayetteville, NC; and Little Creek, VA) can be accomplished for a commensurate cost of 60 GB Splunk Enterprise Perpetual Licensing. Furthermore, any proposed new solution must completely replace the existing Splunk solution immediately after award at each of the aforementioned locations seamlessly and without interruption to operations; providing an equitable amount of log aggregation capability as that offered by 250 GB of Splunk Enterprise Perpetual Licensing.</p>
<p>In response to CJCSI 6510.01D, Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (CND), and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) support requirements for the Warfighter, USSOCOM has employed Splunk to provide the capability of centrally viewing network security status across the entire USSOCOM enterprise infrastructure in real time. USSCOCOM needs additional licensing (60 GB) to satisfy an increased utilization of the Splunk tool to search, report, monitor, and analyze streaming and historical data from a multitude of devices across the enterprise, which includes five physical sites and two separate networks at each site. The increased licensing will be utilized to assist the Splunk tool in conducting centralized security operations viewing of security logs, security events and produce a consolidated listing (using a common taxonomy to describe events) of correlated security events from multiple devices worldwide in order to protect the enterprise from security incidents, malicious intrusion and cyber attacks.</p>
<p>The additional licensing solution must seamlessly integrate with existing Splunk Enterprise Perpetual Licensing to create an aggregate license of 250 GB that can be divided as desired per site. It will support the continued tool capabilities to include but not limited to: ability to search billions of events in seconds on a single commodity server (government provided Dell 815, Dual CPU, 12 core, 2.3 GHz, 6 - 300 GB hard drives with Microsoft Server 2008 R2); investigating security incidents in minutes; troubleshooting or diagnosing malfunctioning applications; and allowing continuous monitoring in efforts of avoiding service degradation or outages. It must also support automatic load balancing to optimize workloads and response times and must enable redundancy and built-in failover support. Also, it must allow the ability to store data to a SAN or other storage device to meet long term storage needs (90 days local storage, 1 year external storage (SAN/NAS)).</p>
<p>The increased licensing shall support Splunk indexes of any kind of IT data (e.g.; Syslog, WMI, SNMP trap) from any source in real time. The solution should support Splunk indexing of all IT data without the need for any specific parsers or adapters to purchase, write, or maintain. The licensing must support a distributed architecture to allow the search of multiple deployments within the USSOCOM Enterprise.</p>
<p>USSOCOM's network monitoring effectiveness will be diminished without this increase in licensing. Furthermore, a lack of sufficient licensing precludes the appropriate visibility of potential risks and limits the ability to quickly identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, which could lead to unauthorized access, denial of services and/or compromised data. This type of activity will pose additional risks to operational SOF missions worldwide.</p>
<p>Proposed solution for USSOCOM must:</p>
<p>&bull; Seamlessly integrate with existing Splunk Enterprise Perpetual Licensing.<br />&bull; Allow division of aggregate licensing across all five sites for two separate networks at each site.<br />&bull; Be interoperable with USSOCOM's current enterprise monitoring tool: Splunk.<br />&bull; Offer agent (forwarder) that is compatible with Windows, Linux, BSD Unix, Solaris Unix, AIX Unix and OS X.<br />&bull; Support transmission compression.<br />&bull; Support web and Command Line Interface (CLI).<br />&bull; Offer customizable reports and reports on raw, unstructured data.<br />&bull; Offer client-side certificate authentication.<br />&bull; Support scalability for potential future growth.<br />&bull; Support distributed searches across peers.<br />&bull; Run on a Microsoft Windows platform (Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2).<br />&bull; Support normal operations and capabilities of the Splunk tool, to include but not limited to: centralized security logging and monitoring of security events; correlation of security events from multiple devices; audit log integration from applications, operating systems and network logs; rapid and thorough identification of computer incidents occurring on any nodes, regardless of physical or network location; analysis of multiple files/folders across an array of servers and support the ability to review both unique closed networks and standalone systems.<br />&bull; Include maintenance support to remediate and/or fix any deficiency or eliminate minor problems.<br />&bull; Provide on-call support to assist in recovery and management of data, files and services.<br />&bull; Provide technical support to assigned personnel to ensure the continued operations with no lapse in current capability.<br />&bull; Meet the standards of DODI 8500.2, Information Assurance (IA) Implementation.<br />&bull; Be delivered immediately after award.</p>
<p>Proposed solution for USSOCOM must not:<br />&bull; Require additional hardware and/or software. <br />&bull; Preclude government from meeting required vulnerability management standards.<br />&bull; Inhibit or impede current Splunk functionality if proposing an upgrade to the current Splunk licenses.<br />&bull; Restrict aggregate license division as required by the government.<br />&bull; Prevent USSOCOM from electing to use licensing on closed networks or stand-alone systems.<br />&bull; Require specific parsers or adapters to purchase, write, or maintain.<br />&bull; Limit the ability to store data to a SAN or other storage device for long term storage needs.<br />&bull; Restrict the aggregate number of devices that can be monitored.<br />&bull; Restrict internal storage.</p>

Contractors may use a direct XML data transfer to the database server or fill in the fields on the website.  The XML direct transfer is a format for transferring files from the Contractor?s systems to a secure web site without the need for separate data entries for each required data element at the web site.  The specific formats for the XML direct transfer may be downloaded from the web site. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-5527 Facsimile Number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FEDEX or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-5527 The AMC-level protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp If Internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures. <BR> <BR>Questions concerning this buy must be submitted at least 3 days prior to the established closing date to reasonably expect a response from the Government. Those questions not received within the proscribed date may not be considered. <BR> <BR>

This research is parsed among three Offices: Smart Collection, Incisive Analysis, and Safe &amp; Secure Operations. This BAA solicits abstracts/proposals for the Office of Smart Collection (SC).
<p>In general, this BAA solicits research to dramatically improve the value of collected data from all sources. Research areas of particular interest to SC (in no particular order) include:<br />&bull; Innovative methods or tools for identifying and/or creating novel sources of new information;<br />&bull; New ways of identifying and assessing collection systems for dramatically improved performance;<br />&bull; Sensor technologies that dramatically improve the reach, sensitivity, size, weight, and power for collection of broad signal or signature types;<br />&bull; Secure communication to and from collection points;<br />&bull; Tagging, Tracking, and Location (TTL) techniques;<br />&bull; Electrically small antennas and other advanced RF concepts;<br />&bull; Agile architectures that intelligently distill useful information at the collector; and,<br />&bull; Innovative means and methods to ensure the veracity of data collected from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>This announcement seeks research ideas for topics that are not addressed by emerging or ongoing IARPA programs or other published IARPA solicitations. It is primarily, but not solely, intended for early stage research that may lead to larger, focused programs through a separate BAA in the future, so periods of performance will generally not exceed 12 months.</p>
<p>Offerors should demonstrate that their proposed effort has the potential to make revolutionary, rather than incremental, improvements to intelligence capabilities. Research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice is specifically excluded.</p>

This research is parsed among three Offices: Smart Collection, Incisive Analysis, and Safe &amp; Secure Operations. This BAA solicits abstracts/proposals for the Office of Incisive Analysis (IA).
<p><br />IA focuses on maximizing insights from the massive, disparate, unreliable and dynamic data that are - or could be - available to analysts, in a timely manner. We are pursuing new sources of information from existing and novel data, and developing innovative techniques that can be utilized in the processes of analysis. IA programs are in diverse technical disciplines, but have common features: (a) Create technologies that can earn the trust of the analyst user by providing the reasoning for results; (b) Address data uncertainty and provenance explicitly.</p>
<p>The following topics (in no particular order) are of interest to IA:</p>
<p>&bull; Methods for developing understanding of how knowledge and ideas are transmitted and change within groups, organizations, and cultures;<br />&bull; Methods for analysis of social, cultural, and linguistic data; <br />&bull; Multidisciplinary approaches to assessing linguistic data sets; <br />&bull; Methods for measuring and improving human judgment and human reasoning; <br />&bull; Methods for extraction and representation of the information in the non-textual contents of documents, including figures, diagrams, and tables;<br />&bull; Methods for understanding and managing massive, dynamic data; <br />&bull; Analysis of massive, unreliable, and diverse data;<br />&bull; Methods for assessments of relevancy and reliability of new data; <br />&bull; Methods for understanding the process of analysis and potential impacts of technology;<br />&bull; Multidisciplinary approaches to processing noisy audio and speech; <br />&bull; Development of novel top-down models of visual perception and visual cognition; <br />&bull; Methods for analysis of significant societal events; <br />&bull; Methods for estimation and communication of uncertainty and risk; <br />&bull; Novel approaches for mobile augmented reality applied to analysis and collection;<br />&bull; Methods for topological data analysis and inferences of high-dimensional structures from low-dimensional representations;<br />&bull; Methods for the study of algorithms stated in terms of geometry (computational geometry);<br />&bull; Methods for geolocation of text and social media;<br />&bull; Novel approaches to biosurveillance;<br />&bull; Methods to make machine learning more useful and automatic;<br />&bull; Methods to construct and evaluate speech recognition systems in languages without a formalized orthography; and,<br />&bull; Methods and approaches to quantifiable representations of uncertainty simultaneously accounting for multiple types of uncertainty.</p>
<p><br />This announcement seeks research ideas for topics that are not addressed by emerging or ongoing IARPA programs or other published IARPA solicitations. It is primarily, but not solely, intended for early stage research that may lead to larger, focused programs through a separate BAA in the future, so periods of performance will generally not exceed 12 months.</p>

<DESC>IARPA invests in high-risk, high-payoff research that has the potential to provide our nation with an overwhelming intelligence advantage over future adversaries. This research is parsed among three Offices: Smart Collection, Incisive Analysis, and Safe &amp; Secure Operations. This BAA solicits abstracts/proposals for the Office of Safe and Secure Operations (SSO).
<p>SSO focuses on threats to the Intelligence Community's ability to operate freely and effectively in an increasingly interdependent and networked world. While some of our challenges emanate from adversary actors, others emerge coincidentally with changes in technology or business practices. This BAA solicits research that explores or demonstrates the feasibility of revolutionary concepts in computation, trust establishment and maintenance, and detecting and deflecting hostile intent. Examples include:</p>
<p>&bull; Approaches to operating securely with imperfect equipment, error-prone users and/or a compromised network. Constructing systems that can perform reliable and secure computations when some fraction of their components is unreliable or insecure. <br />&bull; Computational methods based on architectures other than digital Turing machines whose attributes are matched to efficient or secure solution of intelligence problems (e.g., optical, analog, biological, brain-based, quantum, or hybrid computing systems). <br />&bull; New algorithms and protocols that take advantage of quantum entanglement to perform tasks that are inefficient with classical algorithms.<br />&bull; New approaches to secure transmission of information using optical, electromagnetic, digital packet, chemical, or biological signals. Domains include synchronous and asynchronous communications, bandwidth-constrained digital transmission, and triage of large data flows. <br />&bull; Methods (including compilers and programming languages) for performing complicated computations securely, e.g. multi-party secure functional computation and full homomorphic encryption, but with low overhead. <br />&bull; Detection, classification, and mitigation of attempts by adversaries to compromise safety and security, including, but not limited to penetration and manipulation of electronic infrastructure. <br />&bull; Novel ideas for technologies enabling energy-efficient computation beyond the efficiency projected for end-of-roadmap silicon, as well as strategies for using existing computing technologies to compute with lower power budgets.</p>
<p>This announcement seeks research ideas for topics that are not addressed by emerging or ongoing IARPA programs or other published IARPA solicitations. It is primarily, but not solely, intended for early stage research that may lead to larger, focused programs through a separate BAA in the future, so periods of performance will generally not exceed 12 months.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be utilized. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services, with a small business size standard of $30M dollars. This acquisition is being procured as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>For almost two decades the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), as part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD, has focused on increasing the competitiveness of the United States industrial base by bridging the productivity gap for manufacturers, identifying opportunities for growth, and encouraging technology deployment.</p>
<p>MEP provides its manufacturing customers with a wide array of fundamental services in business and process improvements helping them to stay strong and ready to compete in the global market. We focus on the future for manufacturers by making advanced technology adoption a reality for any-sized business.</p>
<p>To accomplish our mission MEP has used conferencing services with government and non-government entities to facilitate communications and outreach of the Gaithersburg staff as well as the MEP national system as a whole.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain teleconferencing services that provide an on-demand, self-service collaboration environment with both web and video-based multi-media conferencing service (i.e., web conferencing and video conferencing) that can be used by government and non-government entities.</p>
<p>MEP is looking to save travel costs and time while making meetings more efficient and leverage telecommuting technology by sharing documents, agendas, and recordings, and integrating video in a convenient and accessible online meeting space that provides one unified collaborative meeting area for both web conferences and video conferences allowing people to attend meetings from anywhere, anytime, and on any device inside and outside of NIST's firewalls. A secure, low-cost, low-maintenance, standards-based (non-proprietary) business class/enterprise cloud software-as-a-service provider with bundled licensing options including meeting applications for web and video conferencing, training, and technical support is required.</p>
<p>All line items are BRAND NAME ONLY requirements. These brand name products are required because they are the only brand that meets the agency's needs.</p>

<p>Period of Performance: 2/1/2013 to 1/31/2014</p>
<p>Delivery Terms</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination, and take place in accordance with Contractor's commercial schedule. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.</p>
<p>The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria</p>

<DESC><p><br />1. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>2. The solicitation number FA5209-13-Q-QD01 issued as RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-62, DPN 20121231 and AFAC 2012-1107.</p>

<p>4. Set-aside: None</p>
<p>5. List of Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs): Please see attachment.</p>
<p>6. The following provisions applies to this acquisition:</p>
<p>a) FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to offerors-Commercial items (Feb 2012).</p>
<p>b) FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>This provision is incorporated by reference, and paragraph (a) is modified to read as follows:</p>
<p>(a) This is a competitive best value source selection in which the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror. The Government intends to award without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. The following listed are evaluation factors that shall be used in the evaluation process:</p>
<p>1. Price</p>
<p>2. Technical Capability: Technical Acceptability is achieved when the offeror provides proof that the products meet the minimum standards of Item Descriptions, the stated Delivery Date, and Quality Products (Bauer or Equal) (i.e., products brochures and/or products data shall be attached to the price proposal). <br />All offerors shall submit technical description of the products being offered in sufficient detail in addition to the price proposal, to evaluate compliance with the requirements in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(i) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated the completeness, and reasonableness of the proposed price. Incomplete or unreasonable offers shall be rejected and eliminated from further consideration. A single award will result from this evaluation.</p>
<p>(ii) Next, the Government shall evaluate the offerors's technical information as referenced in paragraph (a) 2 above. Technical Acceptability for all offerors will be rated as "met" or "failed" by personnel designated in USAG-J Fire. Technical acceptability is met when the offeror submits proof of technical descriptions/information as stated above and compliance with the delivery requirement.</p>
<p>(iii) If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical capability as defined in above paragraph (a) 2, this Purchase Order will be awarded to the lowest offeror with technically acceptable capability. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical acceptable capability, the Government will then go to the next low offeror in the same manner if they meet the technical capability. This process will continue until an offeror is found to meet the Government technical acceptable capability in ascending order of the low price.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provision FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial items</p>
<p>7. The following clauses applies to this acquisition:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial service identified below, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation VA-263-13-Q-0454 is being issued as an unrestricted Request for Quotation (RFQ) and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 623110 with the small business size standard of $13.5 million.  
The Sioux Falls VA Health Care System Under Statutory Authority 41 USC 253 (c)(5) and 38 U.S.C. 1720 the Government anticipates entering into acquisition negotiations and award of a Basic Ordering Agreement for placement of eligible veterans into a nursing home facility located in Viborg, SD, for a Base Year period 2/1/2013 - 1/31/2014 with four (4) Option Years.  This authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available in this location. The nursing facility shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients. Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.  Facility must have and maintain the Minnesota Department of Health Nursing Facility License.
STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA Beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following: Admission identification record; VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care or State-approved referral form; Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician; Physician orders; Progress notes; the physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen; special reports (laboratory, x ray, activity, etc.; SMA Patient Assessment Form (only if SMA level of care is used); and Minimum Data Set (MDS) information, provided to VA upon admission and every six months thereafter.
15.  The beneficiary will be provided nursing home care at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the nursing care and treatment plan received from VA unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.
16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for fifteen (15) calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  The level of care classification and associated per diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: (a) The recipient is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new admission assessment, (b)The nursing home's Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be completed at customary times during a patient's stay, dependent on projection for short term or long term residence, and adhering to the most current MDS frequency guidelines from Medicare MDS or BRA or MPAF.  The applicable per diem rate will continue until the next assessment. In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VA's request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.  Based on these findings, VA retains the right to remove the automatic applicability of the nursing home generated MDS assessment for payment purposes, and (c) Therapy Requirements - All therapy provided under this contract will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  NOTE: Prior to starting a therapy program, facility must obtain VA pre-authorization.
18.  The VA, at its sole option, will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this agreement, through one or any combination of the following methods; reviews of state agencies reports, on-site inspection of the Nursing Home by VA staff, and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients.  It is agreed that the Nursing Home shall provide VA with copies of all state agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA's quality improvement-quality assurance program functions relating to this agreement, including VA's on-site inspection and monitoring.   The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the contractor's reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.
SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: (1) TERMINATION OF SERVICES:  VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the nursing home at any time, when it is determined to be in the best interest of the VA or the patients, without additional costs to the Government (2) EXTENSION OF AGREEMENT:  This agreement may be extended for four (4) one year periods at the option of the Government in accordance with 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  Notice of an extension must be served in writing by the Government thirty days prior to the scheduled expiration date.  The extension is granted subject to the availability of funds, (3) MINIMUM QUANTITIES:  It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this agreement.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this agreement, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the nursing home as outlined in this agreement.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the facility but not the day the recipient leaves a facility unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one day, (4) LIFE SAFETY CODE CLAUSE:  The administrator of your facility is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer at least 3 days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility, which were in existence at the time this contract was issued.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Fire Safety Officer responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of your facility and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval/disapproval of your facility to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes. Examples of facility change (but not limited to) that require VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows; interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen/trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls/doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems, (5) If the veteran had a former VA primary care physician, VA policy precludes this provider being available to the veteran during the period of nursing home care.  The assigned nursing home physician is the primary doctor during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the community nursing home.  The community nursing home physician is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Physician visits will be according to medical assistance guidelines.  The assigned nursing home physician will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care, easy access to staff for consultation, provide timely response to calls and arrange for timely physician back-up according to OBRA guidelines (Ref. 42 CFR 483.40 OBRA Guidelines), (6) In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident; advance directives/living wills shall be considered according to nursing home doctor's orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian, or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VAMC is contacted by the private hospital physician within 72 hours of admission.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care, (7) VA MEDICAL CENTER CONSULTATION/RESOURCES: (a)  Telephone Care Communications System (TCCS):  For urgent-same day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 605-336-3230 x6181 between 9AM and 3PM Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same day appointment is anticipated, please call as early as possible, (b) Admissions System phone number 605-336-3230.  For non-emergency consultation/evaluation for admission to the VA Medical Center (after initial evaluation/intervention by the nursing home physician), (8) Ancillary Services/Supplies:  Any additional cost to the all-inclusive contract must be preapproved according to the following terms: (a) Medications/supplies will be billed/paid according to generic average wholesale pricing guidelines; monthly invoices verifying cost must be submitted for payment of any additional approved rates. Discharge Medications - on the day of discharge, the facility will dispense medications for a 14 day supply to the veteran and facility can bill to the VA at the AWP, and  (b)  Billing:  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) will not be billed for uncovered services/costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double billing and Federal fraud, (9) The VAMC will pay two-day bed hold for therapeutic passes or re-hospitalization; for longer periods the family must make arrangements with the contract facility to hold a bed.  Reimbursement for all bed holds will be 70% of the prevailing per diem rate.  After a patient absence of fifteen (15) consecutive days the patient authorization for VA contract care ends, and (10) The contract nursing home will assume responsibility for arranging dental care at the veteran's/families' expense.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.

12.  Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200031 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft.  THE SCHEDULE OF LINE ITEMS IS ON A SEPARATE ATTACHMENT.
  




It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.
It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  

Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 

The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:

Cost or Pricing Data
It is DHS policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition.  However, in the event only one responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) or Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.


Evaluation  Commercial Items 
Quotes will be evaluated and purchase order issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable. 
Technically Acceptable:  Quotes must be for new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals.

In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Program Officer is a member of the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative (CR) or his/her designee, which may include the OTI Deputy Country Representative (DCR), and is based in Kenya. This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor or adult dependents.</p>
<p>The Program Officer will be based in Nairobi, Kenya. The position will transition to USAID/Kenya/Education &amp; Youth Office upon OTI's planned exit in mid-2013.</p>
<p>The OTI Program Officer's principal responsibility is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program. The majority of the incumbent's time will be based in Nairobi, working in the U.S. Embassy. The OTI Program Officer is expected to be in daily communication and collaboration with a variety of U.S. Embassy staff, implementing partners, and OTI counterparts.</p>
<p>The OTI/Kenya program is part of the U.S. Government's support of the February 28, 2008 peace accord between competing political parties in the wake of inter-ethnic violence following flawed national elections in December 2007. This program furthers the U.S. high-priority policy objective of helping restore stability in Kenya. The program supports activities mitigating conflict by: 1) Enabling public institutions to undertake fundamental reforms and to manage instability and uncertainty; 2) Mobilizing the public, especially youth &amp; key change agents, to demand accountability and reform, and 3) Fostering identity and self-confidence in at-risk youth in order to enable them to reject extremism. The program contributes to the U.S. objective of supporting peace and stability in the Greater Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Program Officer in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Officer requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Program Officer requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Program Officer is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Program Officer is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Program Officer has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Program Officer is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The Program Officer's priorities are expected to change and evolve in accordance with the requirements of OTI and will be determined in consultation with supervisor. The Program Officer will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull; Represent program interests with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Department of State, and Department of Defense personnel. Explore opportunities for synergy with these entities. Provide lessons learned from the program to these stakeholders given the unique, sensitive and complex programming.</p>
<p>&bull; Work with host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in the SWIFT III Kenya activities.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for the SWIFT III Task Order Kenya.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Disaster Operations Specialists (DOSs) play a central role in the U.S. Government's (USG's) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.   They assist in developing response strategies, in managing all aspects of grants for humanitarian donor organizations, and in preparing talking points, information products, and briefing material.  They manage portfolios consisting of one or several countries, and are members of regionally focused humanitarian response teams consisting of other DOSs, a Team Leader, Information Officers, and Technical Specialists.</p>
<p>DOSs are part of the Disaster Response Team within DRM.  This team consists of six regional groups, each covering the following areas: Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia (EMCA), South Asia (SA), East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), Latin America and the Caribbean (ASIA/LAC), Southern, Western and Northern Africa (SWAN), East and Central Africa (ECA).  Each regional group is managed by a Team Leader.</p>
<p>With this solicitation, OFDA intends to hire DOSs for its Africa regional groups. After an initial time with the Africa regional groups, there may also be opportunities to work with other regional groups within OFDA.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>DRM requires the services of additional Disaster Operations Specialists to enhance its capability to manage its portfolios and effectively respond to international crises and disasters.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

List other End Products: <BR> <BR>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly?

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly? (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <BR> <BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Previous attempts to use non-standard brands of tape caused errors to occur during nightly backup processing, resulting in an increased number of hours needed for the support staff to troubleshoot and correct, and adding a high level of risk to the Agency backup process. <BR> <BR>No Section 508 standards apply to this solicitation as it is for the purchase of a media storage device. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 00001, EFFECTIVE JAN 14, 2013.  The purpose of this amendment is to answer a question why boat with bladders are not considered: a. Bladders are not repairable they need to be removed from the tubes and replaced. Each tube has 3 different size bladders and we would have to purchase multiple bladder types and quantities (we currently have no boats with bladders and have no inventory of bladders). Each bladder is over $300. Over the course of 8-10yrs we will spend countless more dollars on purchasing spare bladders than typical tube patching. b. Repairing a bladder type tube is very time consuming. We can't just patch a puncher in 30 mins. Replacing the bladder will take 3 times as long. Over the course of 8-10yrs (life of tube) we will spend countless more hrs on labor fixing our boats. c. Working conditions need to be almost hospital like ( which is near impossible in a boat shop) to ensure bladder compartment is completely sterile during bladder replacement or small pin holes in new bladder will occur causing slow leaks creating more labor of constantly having to top off tubes every day.  2.  The solicitation closing date remain unchanged.  3.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.  ************************************************************** This is a SSC Pacific combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.

"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />(xv) 52.246-16 Responsibility for Supplies (Apr 1984)<br />(a) Title to supplies furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon formal acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession, unless the contract specifically provides for earlier passage of title.<br />(b) Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss of or damage to supplies shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon --<br />(1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is f.o.b. origin; or<br />(2) Acceptance by the Government or delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract, whichever is later, if transportation is f.o.b. destination.<br />(c) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to supplies that so fail to conform to contract requirements as to give a right of rejection. The risk of loss of or damage to such nonconforming supplies remains with the Contractor until cure or acceptance. After cure or acceptance, paragraph (b) of this section shall apply.<br />(d) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the Contractor shall not be liable for loss of or damage to supplies caused by the negligence of officers, agents, or employees of the Government acting within the scope of their employment.<br />(End of Clause)<br />(xviii) 52.247-34 F.o.b. Destination (Nov 1991)<br />(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this clause, means --<br />(1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and<br />(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.<br />(b) The Contractor shall --<br />(1)<br />(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or<br />(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;<br />(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;<br />(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;<br />(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;<br />(5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and<br />(6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<DESC>The Airframe Digital Twin (ADT) Spiral 1 program seeks to make the Aircraft Structural Integrity program (ASIP) more proactive by increasing the accuracy of the structural prognoses developed within the Individual Aircraft Tracking (IAT) program for each Mission Design Series (MDS). More accurate prognoses can only be developed with higher fidelity flight loads data, more realistic structural analysis models than currently used and a concerted effort to quantify and reduce modeling uncertainty over time.
<p>The ADT Spiral 1 program seeks to augment IAT programs through the fusion of (1) usage/environment data from on-board sensors, (2) maintenance data collected from the field and depot, and (3) data collected as part of the structural development and certification program within high fidelity, physics-based structural prognostic models.</p>
<p>The key innovation within this program is the integration of three key technologies into an improved IAT procedure: (1) probabilistic structural reliability analysis (PSRA), (2) on-board and in-situ damage detection, and (3) advanced flight loads simulations.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this effort is to develop and demonstrate a Prognostic and Probabilistic Individual Aircraft Tracking (P2IAT) methodology that provides better prognostic capability for fatigue cracking of metallic structures. The P2IAT approach will integrate advanced flight loads simulation, airframe structural stress analysis, fatigue life analysis, probabilistic structural reliability analysis, and uncertainty quantification methods. The methodology will use higher fidelity loads derived from the flight history of the specific aircraft than the current IAT approach to achieve better prognostic results. It will be modular so that the method can be easily applied to different MDS and new analysis models can be readily integrated. Uncertainty in input parameters and output variables for the P2IAT algorithms will be described by probability distributions. Confidence bounds shall be placed on both the input and output probability distributions. Criteria for when to perform structural inspections will be established based on the probability of an event occurring (e.g., a crack of a specified size existing, probability of failure, etc.). The contractor will demonstrate the effectiveness of the P2IAT approach by tracking fatigue damage in two full-scale structural experiments that simulate flight-by-flight loading. These experiments will be conducted by the government, but will be planned jointly with the contractor.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT A00004 TO IFB VA263-12-B-1082 BEGINS.
The purpose of this amendment is to issue clarifications.

Q:	I sent a substitution request and did not receive a reply. What should I do?
A:	Bids should be prepared in strict accordance with all solicitation provisions, contract clauses, specifications and drawing, including FAR 52.236-5, Material and Workmanship. Basis of design items detailed in the specifications and drawings establish a standard of quality and do not limit competition. Basis of design items are not sole source or brand only items, but rather allow offerors to analyze the properties of those items in order to ensure that the actual items planned as part of the bidding process meet the specifications for this project. Offerors must utilize items (equipment, material, articles and/or processes) that meet the specifications. Items that by their nature change the specifications for the project are not allowed. Post-award submittals and approvals are required and the Contractor shall be responsible for any costs related to the rejection of submittals.

Q:  	The bidding documents state that Prospective contractors shall note that this solicitation is planned as a 100% SDVOSB Set-aside. Does this apply only to Prime bidders or does this also apply to subcontractors and sub-subcontractors as well? 
A: 	No. Only the Prime bidder is required to be a registered SDVOSB. 

Q:	Is an OSHA 30 competent person required?
A:	Yes. The dedicated supervisor for this project must be an OSHA 30 competent person and must be on site at any time that work is being performed.

Q:	Do clean up, dust prevention, infection control and other requirements pertain to this project?
A:	Yes. The requirements are detailed in the solicitation provisions, contract clauses, specifications and drawings.

Q:	How do the specifications relate to local and state building codes and other requirements?
A:	The United States Department of Veterans Affairs specifications override any local or state codes or requirements.

Q:	Will there be space on site, provided for project staging and storage?
A:	On-site staging and storage space will be provided as available, but is limited, as described in the specifications.

Q:	Is the 60-day bid hold a valid amount of time?
A:	VA anticipates award will be made as soon as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder is identified; however, due to recent issues with verification of SDVOSBs, the bid hold is set at 60 days in order to provide time for any Fast Track verification request to be processed prior to award.

Q:	Is fall or spring construction start required? 
A:	A fall start is planned.

Q:	Does the project involve work on the geothermal well field?
A:	No. The project requires connection to the facility heating and cooling system, but the well field itself is being handled under separate contracts.
 



Bidders are reminded that they must acknowledge all amendments on the SF 1442 submitted with their bid. The following amendments have been issued.

The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.

<DESC><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE - THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD TO IMMUNALYSIS CORPORATION TO ASSIST THE OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR PERSONNEL AND READINESS WITH MISSION CRITICAL SUPPORT.</strong><br /><br />WHS Acquisition Directorate intends to issue a contract to Immunalysis Corporation on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) Drug Demand Reduction Program (DDRP) was mandated in 1981 and given the mission to deter DoD personnel from using prohibited drugs. The DoD DDRP policy for military service members is promulgated in DoD Directive 1010.1, with detailed guidance concerning drug testing procedures contained in DoD Directive 1010.16. The DoD DDRP is aligned with DoD policies that pertain to health and readiness within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.<br /><br />DDRP's mission involves compulsory random drug testing with punitive consequences, anti-drug education, and treatment. The effectiveness of this program is measured by monitoring the prevalence of drug use from drug testing statistics published annually.<br /><br />DDRP conducts testing at six DoD Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratories (FTDTLs), as well as the Forensic Toxicology Laboratory of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (FORTOX-AFMES). Each location currently uses the Hitachi / Roche D-Modular Analyzer System(s) to perform mission critical testing. There are approximately 24 D-Modular systems spread throughout DDRP's testing environment. The Government has invested approximatly $4.32M in its existing instrumentation which enables DDRP to meet mission goals.
<p>The DDRP has a mission critical requirement to test the use of synthetic cannabinoids by members of the Military Services. As such, this effort is to procure immunoassay reagents to be used on the Government's existing Hitachi / Roche instrumentation to meet the Government's need. (Note: There is currently not a requirement to replace the existing analyzer systems.)</p>
<p>Since the introduction and widespread use of synthetic cannabinoids into the drug culture, the DDRP has conducted a joint effort with the National Institute of Drug Abuse and AFMES to identify a strategy to deter and detect the use of synthetic cannabinoids by military personnel. In the course of this effort, Immunalysis Corporation was identified as the only manufacturer of an immunoassay reagent capable of identifying the broad class of synthetic cannabinoid parent and/or metabolites found in urine as a result of synthetic cannabinoid abuse on the existing analyzer systems currently in use at the FTDTLs and FORTOX-AFMES.</p>
<p>Therefore, the initial contract action will be established with Immunalysis Corporation as an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a period of 12 months, from approximately 01 MAR 2013 through 28 FEB 2014, and will include four (4) 12 month option periods. WHS Acquisition Directorate anticipates issuing firm fixed price delivery orders under this contract to meet the mission critical needs of DDRP. The minimum order amount is $26,000.00 and the not-to-exceed maximum total is $7.5M.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that another manufactured immunoassay reagent capable of identifying the broad class of synthetic cannabinoid parent and or metablites found in urine as a result of synthetic cannabinoid abuse is compatible with the existing Hitachi / Roche D-Modular Analyzer System(s). If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice. Interested parties may identify their capabilities with respect to this requirement by 25 JAN 2013, at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. All information received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 339999 (All Other Miscellaneous Manufacturing), with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>

<p>TSA determined a cost plus fixed fee type contract would be the best option for this action.  The contractor had previously operated under a similar type of contract and in order to maintain a level of continuity, and because historical actual costs were available it was determined best to use a cost plus fixed fee contract.</p>
<p>The attached Justification and Approval outlines the details as to why a sole source award was necessary.</p>

<DESC><br />The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Strategic Sourcing Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source with the Hewlett Packard using the procedures in FAR Parts 6 and 13, to continue with the use of HP Software Support and Maintenance Renewal. The maintenance provided includes patches, updates, and technical support, as needed. The NESDIS Office of Satellite and Product Operations (OSPO) has a requirement to support telemetry and command of the nation's legacy weather satellite constellation ground systems. These ground systems are based upon the OpenVMS Operating System (OS) and execute custom FORTRAN applications which are specifically designed for the hardware, operating system, layered product software, and utilities integrated into OpenVMS. In addition, the GOES Enterprise Management System (GEMS) Sensor Processing System (SPS), Re-hosted Product Monitor (RPM), Consolidated Analysis Workstation (CAWS) hardware/software require HP support/updates. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 423430 with a small business size standard of 100 employees. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Stephen.a.taylor@noaa.gov by January 28, 2013. Award will be made using FAR 13, Simplified acquisition procedures, current through FAC 2005-55. The determination to compete or not complete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Please indicate NEEB1000-13-00182 on your response.<br />
