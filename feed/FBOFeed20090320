<DESC>The Bureau of Indian Affairs intends on awarding a sole source acquisition to Panoptic Insight, LLC.  The requirement is for two 2-day communications and teambuilding training for Office of the Chief Financial Officer staff  in Reston, VA,   and follow-up training for Office of the Chief Financial Officer staff  in Minneapolis, MN This is follow-on training to a previous contract with Panoptic Insight.  Use of Panoptic Insight, LLC for this training will provide cost savings to the government because the vendor has already developed the curriculum, and it has proven successful for the BIA staff.   It will also ensure consistent training throughout the DAS-M organization. It is particularly important to retain this vendor to conduct the follow-up workshop because they are familiar with the circumstances in MN .  There is also a requirement for reporting on the results of this and previous workshops for the CFO, and to provide some Executive Coaching based on previous workshop findings.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the Government's discretion.  No formal solicitation shall be issued.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Health Effects Laboratory Division, Exposure Assessment Branch, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to The Pennsylvania State University for the examination of&nbsp;whether the use of a sample holder influences the concentrations measured using activated carbon sorbent tubes for organic vapors.
<p>The specific aims for this project are to:<br />1. Examine whether there are significant differences (&gt;10%) between concentrations measured using activated carbon sorbent tubes with three different sample holder configurations: 1) no sample holder - charcoal tube facing upward with end open to ambient atmosphere, b) using an SKC brand sample holder, and c) using a Sensidyne brand sample holder. <br />2. Characterize the nature of any significant effects by examining different vapors spanning a range of chemical/physical properties (e.g., polarity, BP, VP), different types of sampling pumps (pulsating stroke-counter type, vs. "continuous" type pumps), different vapor exposure profiles (highly variable vs. relatively constant), different sampling flow rates (high &gt;200 mL/min vs. low&lt;20 mL/min).<br />3. Propose and evaluate mechanisms governing any identified effects.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, Reference 000HCCCD-2009-68400, Centers for Disease Control, NIOSH, ATTN: Rebecca Mullenax, MS: GD, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with The Pennsylvania State University, 408 Old Main, University Park, PA 16802-1505 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Silver Spring, Maryland, intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with GovCorps of Columbia, MD, to provide expertise and contract support to NOAA OCIO's High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) program. Vendors who believe that they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating the can meet the Governments requirements: By demonstrating they can providing expertise required in high performance computing contractual requirements, the ability to understand and properly enforce contractual performance metrics specific to high performance computing and the ability to assist the program office with its future HPCC procurement planning. The planning includes performing risk analysis and pervading strategy recommendation in areas such as acquisition approach and award structure. Show they have developed the knowledge, processes and documentation templates to provide the needed assistance within a compressed time frame. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detained technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit documentation will result the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. GovCorps is a small business. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15 days after this publication to this synopsis. This requirement is being done as a simplified acquisition.&nbsp; JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION&nbsp; 1. Requesting agency and contracting activity: The requesting agency is the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC). The contracting activity is the NWS Acquisition Management Division.&nbsp; 2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: The DOC NOAA OCIO is responsible for executing NOAA's high performance computing and communications (HPCC) mission. This mission accelerates the adoption of advanced computing, communications and information technology throughout NOAA. NOAA's HPCC program is also home to the world's premiere climate forecasting laboratory and its modeling efforts in weather forecasting provide finer resolution in global and regional models that result in better weather forecasting and warning services. This, in turn, enables NOAA's researchers to collaborate effectively, efficiently, and easily with colleagues throughout NOAA, the nation and the world. NOAA awarded multiple high performance computing support services contracts to achieve this mission. The total contract value between these contracts exceeds one-half billion dollars and spans across multiple years. External, expert acquisition support services are needed to ensure continuity and effective execution of the multi-year, multi-million dollar effort of NOAA's HPCC program. 3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value): &bull; Provide expert pre-award and post-award acquisition support services to NOAA. NOAA requires these support services and expertise to minimize the risks inherent in procuring HPCC systems of this magnitude and complexity. These acquisition support services require knowledge of high performance computing contractual requirements, the ability to understand and properly enforce contractual performance metrics specific to high performance computing, and the ability to assist the program office with its future HPCC procurement planning. This planning includes performing risk analysis and providing strategy recommendations in areas such as acquisition approach and award structure. &bull; Estimated Value - simplified acquisition 4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: 41 USC 253(c)(1) - Only one known responsible source. 5. Demonstration the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of authority cited: GovCorps has been providing expertise and contract support services in the execution of the NOAA OCIO's HPCC program. They have developed the knowledge, processes, and documentation templates to provide the needed assistance within the time frame required. Between the pending economic stimulus packages, the inclusion of the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program (HFIP) and current contract expirations, the HPCC program is on a very compressed time schedule from NOAA and GovCorps is the only company with the intimate process knowledge to assist in a timely manner. GovCorps' unique qualification is its combination of acquisition expertise and an understanding of high performance computing. GovCorps utilized this unique mix to successfully protect the Government's interests, minimize risk, maximize value, and avoid possible contractual litigation. Given the contractual and program complexities, the sheer dollar value of the HPCC contracts and the compressed time schedules from which NOAA must execute, awarding this contract action to the same vendor insures uninterrupted HPCC program support and lowers the Government's overall risk. 6. A description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies: This requirement will be posted in FedBizOps and all responses will be evaluated before a decision for award is made. 7. Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable: A determination to see if the cost is fair and reasonable will be made and cited in the price negotiation memorandum before award.&nbsp;8. Description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted: See # 4 and #6 above. 9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. None. 10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None.&nbsp;11. A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: Analysis and market research will be done to see if any new requirement can be done competitively. 12. Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief: The contracting officer's signature on the first page of this justification constitutes certification.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory intends to award to Valon Technologies Inc., on other than full and open competitive basis for the assembly, fabrication, testing and delivery of a Modular UHF Transponder and Power Amplifier Assembly. The UHF Transponder must do a non-processing conversion of signals in the 250-270 MHz range and convert them to signals in the 290-310 MHz range without distortion. The power amplifier stage must accept two transponder inputs, combining with them to produce an overall gain of 100 dB and a power output of 2W. Both of the units must be lightweight and have an input and output impedances of 50 ohms and be electronically shielded (enclosed) to reduce EMI. The delivery will be required within 10 weeks of contract award. Additional specifications will appear in the RFQ. Sole source is based on Duplication of ongoing effort for advanced fabrication of a proven Modular Transponder Design to Valon Technologies Inc. (Microsoft IE Required). The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to award a noncompetitive procurement to Australian Scientific Instruments of Fyshwick, Canberra, ACT 2609, Australia for the purchase of a software upgrade for the U.S. Geological Microprobe Laboratory that will allow automated, unattended and remote operation of the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Micro Probe with Reverse Geometry (SHRIMP-RG). The SHRIMP-RG was purchased, and is operated, in partnership with the Stanford University of Earth Sciences.  The automation software is required because it will increase productivity and provide higher quality data, while reducing costs by decreasing the need for operator control of the ion microprobe and by enhancing the ability to analyze more samples per 24 hour period.  Additionally, the software upgrade will allow for precise sample positioning and programmed analysis; which given the ability to pre-select positions for automated analysis (without the need for an operator present) allows standard mineral grain mounts and previously unusable samples such as rock thin sections to be quickly and accurately analyzed.  The software is also necessary for future interface hardware upgrades.  The automation and instrument control software is an integral part of the SHRIMP-RG and is only available from the manufacturer of the instrument, Australian Scientific Instruments and is not available from any other commercial or non-commercial sources.  The original software was a collaborative effort between the USGS, Australian Scientific Instruments, and the Australian National University (ANU).  This Software was written specifically for the SHRIMP-RG at Stanford and a sister SHRIMP-RG at the ANU.  These are the only SHRIMP-RGs in the world.  The software purchase also includes 1 week of training and software customization to interface with the specific hardware configuration in the USGS-Stanford SHRIMP-RG to meet unique USGS research requirements.  No other sources are known to possess the unique and essential qualifications in the above-mentioned information.     This is not a request for competitive quotes and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they can provide these supplies and services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of the publication date of this synopsis.  Determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement.  Point of Contact:  Cheryl Fitch, Contracting Specialist, cfitch@usgs.gov. All requests for information shall be in writing.

<DESC><p><br /><strong>6625AF Resistance Measurement System Upgrade</strong> <br />This request for information/sources sought announcement is issued to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market. The Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program is considering a Sole Source Purchase of a 6625AF Resistance Measurement System Upgrade. <br />The 6625AF Resistance Measurement System Upgrade would allow the US Air Force to obtain improved accuracy and use our higher current range extenders (300 amps). The Upgrade will add capabilty to calibrate DC current shunts at the base PMEL from 2 amps to 300 amps. This upgrade will also lower the current accuracy at 1 Ohms from 99 ppm to 1.2 ppm and from 1 Ohm to 100 Meg Ohms reducing the current accuracy to calibrate Fluke 5700A, 5720A, 5500A and 5520A resistance section to an 4:1 TAR. Currently we are at 2:1 TAR. Overall it would allow the US Air Force base PMELs to obtain improved accuracy and use a higher current range extenders (300 amps) to calibrate their 9211 current shunts. The upgrade would also include a new Firmware that would decrease measurement time, and change the way the data is displayed and add internal memory. The system upgrade shall include a new system controller that will have an updated Bridgeworks software for the additonal functions. The upgrade shall allow the system to up 300 amps, if the local Base PMEL has a requirement to go above 300 amps, the upgrade shall allow the ability to go up to 3000 amps with an additional range extender (which would be required to be purchased by local PMEL). Each 6622 Resistance bridge would recieved a full factory calibration. <br /><strong>The total estimated quantity is 81 Unit(s). <br /></strong>Surplus or used material is not acceptable for this item.

The Air Force Metrology and Calibration<br />Program is considering a purchase of a Low Power 50.0 GHz Calibration System.<br />The Low Power 50 GHz Calibration System will calibrate low power coaxial standards and general<br />power sensing TMDE. The system will be able to provide a standardized power level ranging from min<br />0.01mW to 10mW. The frequency range of the system will be 100 Khz to 50 GHz. The command<br />and control functions of the system will be automated and a GUI will provide the a fully automated<br />calibration process. The system will be based upon the NIST developed Direct Comparison Power<br />System (DCPS).<br />Hardware: Separate feed-thru RF power standards for the range 100 kHz to 18 GHz and 10 MHz to 50 GHz to provide smooth, single connection calibration of most sensors and provide reduced wear and damage opportunity on the fragile 2.4mm connector of the 50 GHz standard. Standards based on long-proven direct DC substitution technology for minimum drift, best linearity, lowest uncertainty, and a design lineage to calorimeter artifacts. Standard monitors incorporating latest digital technology, coordinating with software to digitally level to any set power with steps limited only by the generator, and capable of direct power read-out from any commercially produced thermistor mount.<br />Software: Automate the calibration process, including Gamma Correction, Dynamic Uncertainty Calculation, and collection of S11 data using either of two methods: Control Vector Network Analyzers, OR Using multiple offset lines (with supporting beads for robustness), performs multiple RF power<br />measurements and estimate vector S11. Although this method has higher uncertainty than VNA at low<br />reflections, it will be adequate to dramatically reduce power calibration error in labs without VNA's.<br />Perform manufacturer's specified linearity checks and reports pass-fail and calculates adjusted<br />factors if adjustment procedures are available from the manufacturer. Writes calibration factors and other adjustment factors into power sensor EEPROM. Is designed to support RF power standards requiring customized power balancing bridges that are "read" using voltmeters. Type IV bridges and power meters with proportional output will be supported. This allows use with both legacy power meters and the Primary Standards. Is designed to expose well-documented function-oriented methods that will allow Air Force AFMETCAL NextGen programmers to implement "higher-level" test management such as:<br />Recipe/Procedure Management, Test reporting, Customized data reporting.<br /><strong>The total estimated quantity is 75 Unit(s).</strong><br />Surplus or used material is not acceptable for this item.

<DESC><p>Description:
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - QF-4 Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) - Lots 16 and 17 Follow-On Production and Sustainment - The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 691st Armament Systems Squadron, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL is conducting market research in preparation for a new contract to be awarded in FY10 for 2 production lots of QF-4 Full Scale Aerial Targets (FSATs) and approximately 5 years of engineering/sustainment support. QF-4 targets are used by the 53d Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG) to test and evaluate air-to-air and surface-to-air weapon systems. The Air Force currently procures the QF-4 target, produced by BAE Systems, to meet this need. The Government does not own a current technical data package for the QF-4 FSAT, does not have peculiar support equipment available to provide to interested sources and does not have research and development funding to develop a new QF-4 target system. The QF-4 program involves the contractor modifying Government-furnished RF-4C aircraft and installing a contractor-furnished drone package, resulting in a remotely controlled, supersonic, afterburning FSAT capable of all-attitude, high G maneuvering flight. Major contractor-furnished items are as follows: (1) Command Telemetry System (CTS), (2) Primary and Back-up Automatic Flight Control Systems (AFCSs), (3) Flight Termination System (FTS), and (4) Vector Scorer System. The FSAT must be compatible with the Gulf Range Drone Control System (GRDCS) at Tyndall and the Drone Formation Control System (DFCS) at the White Sands Missile Range NM. In addition to producing the FSAT, the contractor must provide the following: 1) Maintenance/repair of Government-furnished RF-4C aircraft upon delivery of the aircraft from the Government to delivery of the FSAT at Tyndall AFB FL, (2) Sustaining engineering for support of the currently deployed FSAT systems (to include configuration management, development of design changes, integration, and documentation (engineering and technical order data) of newly defined requirements), (3) Drone-unique component warranty, (4) Repair of out-of-warranty FSAT system equipment, (5) Support to sustain logistics/drone-unique technical order/manual (issued as supplemental manuals to basic F-4 manual series), (6) On-site technical support at Tyndall AFB FL, and (7) spares provisioning for the drone package components. Environmental stress screening (ESS) from the lowest assembly through the system-level will be required on all drone-unique system components. The sustaining engineering support requirement is projected to extend to 2016. The following provisions will apply to each production lot: 1) Procurement of a variable quantity ranging from 1 to 24 FSATs with a most likely quantity of 12 targets per lot, 2) All drone-unique components procured from other than currently qualified component vendor(s) will be subject to a formal qualification program, and 3) All FTS explosive components will be subject to lot acceptance testing. The QF-4 FSAT system is defined by the following documentation, which is available in an electronic technical library that is accessible to interested sources with the required export control license IAW DoD Directive 5230.25: (1) Government-developed/maintained Performance Specification, (2) Contractor-developed and maintained set of Type-B (B1, B2, and B5) Specifications, (3) Contractor-developed and maintained set of Type-C (C1, C1b, C2, C2b, C4, and C5) Specifications, (4) Out-dated Technical Data Package (TDP), and (5) Set of drone-unique supplemental manuals to the basic F-4 technical order series. Specifications are on digital media, format compatible with Microsoft Windows - Word/Excel/Power Point. The TDP consists primarily of digital media - text in Microsoft Windows - Word/Excel/Power Point format, mechanical drawings in .dwg file extension, Auto Cad format, and electrical/electronic/artwork in Gerber Out format. Technical orders consist of Word text files with Auto Cad and Gerber Out format illustration sub-files. The Government intends to include a copy of all reference documents, except the F-4 basic technical order series, in a technical library that will be located on the Aerial Targets Information Management System (ATIMS) site, a Lotus Notes-based system accessible via the Internet. Interested sources can examine related program documentation, except for the basic F-4 technical order/manual series, via ATIMS once authorized/cleared by the Program Office. However, the Program Office will have to coordinate use of the F-4 technical order library, maintained at Tyndall AFB FL, on an as required/requested basis. Schedule is critical for this procurement, and any potential source must be able to deliver targets within the required timeframe to meet critical mission requirements. A contract award of Mar 2010 is anticipated with a delivery rate of up to 2 targets per month. Deliveries must begin within 12 months from the award of the production lot in order to maintain full scale target inventories to support Air Force requirements. Interested sources who have a candidate drone package that can be installed within a RF-4C and can meet the performance and schedule requirements outlined above are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC). The SOC must include independent tailored test reports and other appropriate documentation to demonstrate the following: 1) Respondent has a candidate drone package that meets the QF-4 Performance Specification, Rev L including interface requirements with specified target control systems; 2) A manufacturing plan demonstrating the ability to meet delivery schedule and production rate; 4) Interested source has the technical expertise/experience and peculiar support equipment to modify RF-4Cs to install the candidate drone package; 5) Respondent has the technical expertise and experience to perform maintenance/ repair of Government-furnished RF-4C aircraft and repair out-of-warranty FSAT system equipment; 6) Interested source has the necessary sustaining engineering capability to provide onsite technical support at Tyndall AFB FL and to maintain drone-unique technical order/manual; 7) Respondent has the capability to provide spares provisioning and 8) Respondent will provide an extended warranty for the drone package. In addition to these capabilities, the interested source must be certified to handle and store classified data, software, firmware, and hardware at the SECRET/NOFORN level. The SOC shall be limited to 25 pages including attachments. As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort. Firms responding to this synopsis should also state whether or not they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone certified, woman-owned, disabled-veteran owned, or minority concern as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-1 and FAR 52.219-2. The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition shall be 336411 with a size standard of 1,500 employees. A decision as to whether this acquisition shall be full and open competition or small business set-aside shall be based on responses to this synopsis and other market research. Firms that have submitted a Statement of Capabilities will be contacted concerning the Government's assessment of their capabilities. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment to contract by the Government. Interested companies must submit a statement of capability within 15 days of this announcement to Ms Deanna Wright at 691st ARSS, 207 West D Avenue, Suite 626, Eglin AF, FL 32542-6853 or at Deanna.wright@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC><p>Legacy for Children <sup>TM</sup></p>
<p>Sources Sought<br />PR 67510<br />2009-N-11192</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation and does not guarantee that the Government will proceed with a solicitation or award of a contract in the future. This notice is only for market research purposes.</p>
<p>This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential small business (e.g. 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women-owned small business) that can provide the services below.</p>
<p>The project is a longitudinal follow-up of the Legacy for Children <sup>TM</sup> study participants. Legacy is a multisite, randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the potential for improving child developmental outcomes through parenting programs designed to promote self-efficacy and a sense of community. Two research sites, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and the University of Miami participated in the study. The first contract was to implement the intervention and assess and follow the children prenatally or from birth until age 5. In the first phase of the study, 615 participants were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned into intervention and comparison groups. Eligibility was mainly based on indicators of low income and on geographic location.</p>
<p>Some interventions that resulted in initial significant improvements in outcomes found the effect to fade at later age points (e.g., Infant Health and Development Program), whereas other interventions documented significant positive findings many years after the intervention was completed (Perry Preschool Project, Abecedarian Project). To properly understand the potential impact of Legacy for Children<sup>TM</sup> on children's long term healthy development, we must follow children beyond the preschool years.</p>
<p>The purpose of this new contract is to establish ongoing outcome evaluation for this early childhood intervention program (Legacy), following children into the school years. The goal of this study is to test the long term efficacy of an early intervention model intended to promote child development through influencing parenting behavior. Three assessment periods are proposed-- ages 8, 10, and 12 years-- in order to capture cognitive, behavioral and socio-emotional outcomes during the early and middle school-age years, as well as the beginning of adolescence. These assessment periods parallel those from other parenting intervention studies and are critical periods when learning and behavioral/ socio-emotional problems emerge. Identifying these problems and assessing the impact of the early parenting intervention on these key developmental outcomes is an important step towards prevention of childhood disorders. <br /><br />Results from this study will provide data to influence state and national policies and to guide services for young children and their families. The collected data will inform the public whether these intervention services, delivered during the early years of life, can influence long-term educational and social outcomes such as school performance, employment, dependence on social services, antisocial and criminal behavior, and family unity.</p>
<p>The project being proposed is a phased contract consisting of three phases. <br />Phase 1: Preparatory work and start up, 12 months<br />Phase 2: Data collection and Assessment: 6-7 years<br />Phase 3: Project completion, 6 months, following completion of at least age 12, assessment</p>
<p>Businesses having the capability to perform this work are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) in order for the Government to determine acquisition strategy for this procurement. Capable offerors must clearly demonstrate that they possess expertise, experience and a thorough comprehensive knowledge in the study requirement. In addition, the SOC shall clearly address the offeror's capabilities in the following areas:</p>
<p>The proposed staff should have substantial research experience in childhood intervention with knowledge of applied research methodology. In addition the offeror should have experience in working with at risk and ethnically diverse populations; especially in determining appropriate assessment methods for maintaining sample size with these populations. The Principal Investigator should be experienced in child development; longitudinal research and evaluation methods; assessment methodology; data collection/management and be available for providing adequate input to the research activities.</p>
<p>The offeror shall describe past and current experiences: a) working with state health departments, other public health entities, and health care providers; b) conducting large, multi-state cohort investigations where high response rates are essential; c)collecting high-quality interview data from populations that may be low-income, Spanish-speaking, or migratory; d) managing and analyzing complex datasets; and e) writing for scientific publication. The offeror should clearly describe resources for data management and analyses, including biostatistical expertise.</p>
<p>The contractor shall, acting independently and not as an agent of the Government, provide all labor, supervision, equipment, materials, supplies, travel, transportation and perform all work necessary to perform the study.</p>
<p>Interested businesses that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit a hardcopy and an electronic copy of their capability statement, addressing the minimum contractor requirements identified above. Companies must demonstrate their ability and experience in providing these services within the last 36 months. Please limit responses to 5 pages or less. Any proprietary information should be specifically identified as such. References shall include company name, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and email address. Capability statements shall identify the business status (e.g. small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women owned small business) of the organization. Responses, both electronic and hardcopy, must be received by April 2, 2009 4:00 pm EDST. Capability statements will not be accepted after the due date and time.</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration Office of Motor Vehicle Management (GSA Fleet) is seeking qualified vendors who can provide the following vehicle data services.

GSA Fleet is seeking the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) stated Environmental Protection Agency submitted miles per gallon (MPG) ratings, city and highway (and combined if available), for vehicles in the Federal fleet.  These values will be derived on a vehicle identification number (VIN) matching basis for the inventory of vehicles.

GSA Fleet desires to obtain the OEM specified MPG ratings for the largest percentage of vehicles as possible.  The inventory consists of over 250,000 vehicles ranging from compact sedans, minivans, passenger vans, SUVs, pick-up trucks, maintenance utility vehicles, buses, ambulances, medium and heavy trucks, and trailers (no MPG requested).  While the majority of vehicles are recent model years (2000 and on), there are a number of vehicles that date back farther.  It is desired that every vehicle should be provided with the OEM MPG ratings and an explanation of how many model years (how far back) the vendor is able to provide this data is requested.

It is anticipated that the successful vendor will be able to provide the requested MPG information by a match on the subject vehicles VIN.  GSA Fleet will provide a simple listing of VINs.  The resultant file will return the VIN and the OEM MPG ratings for city and highway (and combined if available).  The desired output format is electronic, with Excel (.xls), text (.txt), or comma-separated value (.csv) files being preferred.

It is anticipated that this will be a one-time exercise of data matching (with the opportunity for correction of incorrect or missing VINs) and not a recurring data analysis need.  A file processing turnaround time of less than two (2) days is requested.

<DESC>Purchase Background 

The NIST Enabling Devices Group requires a Soft-Matter Nanoscale-Metrology System to support its work in Nanobiotechnology and Liposome Nanoparticles.  The system will comprise three commercial instruments, 1) a Hard-Matter 3D AFM, 2) a Bio-AFM, and 3) a Nanoparticle Size-Distribution Measurement Tool.  The types of samples to be measured in this system include soft and hard nano-particles, nano-lines, nano-trenches, nano-tubes, and nano-pores, as well biological surfaces and molecules.  The properties of these samples will be investigated in support of Group projects, for possible use as standard reference materials, and to compare the measurement standards and capabilities of the hard-matter and soft-matter nano-measurement communities.   After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a Hard-Matter 3D AFM that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

The capabilities and performance specifications that are required for the hard-matter 3D-AFM component of the Soft-Matter Nanoscale-Metrology System are defined below. This component must have the following capabilities: 

1)	Capability to align samples in the system optically relative to the probe tip to within plus or minus 1 micrometer.  
2)	An automatic or semi-automatic computer-controlled capability to rotate a sample that contains a previously measured feature through an angle defined by the user and then to move the wafer the correct distance in the x-y plane to locate the same feature for re-measurement in the new orientation.   
3)	Recipe positioning of samples in the system relative to the probe tip to within plus or minus 1 micrometer.  
4)	Sensor and probe technology capable of detecting the three dimensional structure and capable of tracking surface proximity in two orthogonal directions in order to measure the horizontal and vertical surface profiles and the transition regions between them.  
5)	Support measurements on particles, lines, trenches, and holes.  
6)	Capability to measure surface profiles and surface roughness including, but not limited to, concave and convex sidewalls and 2D shapes such as a portion of the surface of a particle.  
7)	Z-axis range of motion at least 5 micrometers during measurements.
8)	Vertical resolution or noise level, which ever is greater, less than 0.1 nm (RMS if for noise). 
9)	Capability to scan regions less than or equal to 50 micrometers by 50 micrometers.  
10)	 Deviations from flatness in X and Y scan directions less than 10 nm.  
11)	 Line width, intermittent contact, deep trench, and contact modes of operation. 
12)	 Stage drift less than 1nm per hour.
13)	 X, Y, and Z-axis linearity less than 0.01% defined as one half of the peak to valley deviations from a straight line divided by the scan range. 
14)	 Z-axis short-term measurement reproducibility of less than plus or minus 0.1 nm. 
15)	XY-plane pitch measurement reproducibility of less than plus or minus 0.1 nm plus or minus 0.1% of the distance traveled for distance less than 3 micrometers.  
16)	Meets (SEMI E10-0304 definitions) on reliability and uptime.  
17)	 Class 1000 clean room enclosure
18)	 Static discharge capability    

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture these types of systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<CONTACT>Helen R Nelson, Phone 860-271-2843, Email helen.r.nelson@uscg.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (RDC), NEW LONDON, CT.  This Request For Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess scientific and technical capabilities that will best address the USCGs need.  

The USCG RDC needs to identify test facilities capable of performing tests of full-scale ballast water treatment (BWT) systems.  In conjunction with the Center for Corrosion Science & Engineering at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Key West, FL, the USCG RDC intends to conduct research to determine the nature and degree of differences in results between facilities testing a single BWT system according to a set test protocol.  This research is intended to support the USCGs efforts to develop practical and effective protocols for evaluating the performance of ballast water treatment systems.

The RDC seeks information from test facilities that expect to continue in the future as one of several U. S. locations testing the efficacy of BWT systems.  Facilities should have already conducted shakedown tests to characterize the facility, or be prepared to do so, prior to participating in the planned BWT system tests.  The RDC needs to assess interest in participation in this research effort, determine schedule availability, and understand the potential costs that will be incurred to conduct this testing at such facilities.  

No decisions regarding selection of test facilities to participate in the tests have been made. In the future, it is the RDCs intention to conduct tests at two or more facilities subject to schedule and cost constraints.  As a result, a future solicitation may be offered based upon industry response to this RFI.

The prospective test facilities shall have the capability to conduct full-scale BWT system tests according to a specified test protocol which will be provided as Government Furnished Information (GFI).  For the purposes of this RFI, however, a DRAFT test protocol, representing the testing procedures USCG anticipates requiring in the future, is provided as Attachment A. 

To participate in this study, test facilities shall be required to have the following capabilities and resources:

1)  Access to a natural water supply (fresh, brackish, or marine) capable of supplying water and ambient organisms at the required flow rate;

2)  the capability to install and operate full-scale BWT systems; 

3)  holding tanks greater than 100 cubic meters in size to realistically reflect those found on vessels; 

4)  separate control and treatment tanks;

5)  the capability to completely empty and clean interior surfaces of tanks between tests;

6)  all applicable permits in place for disposing of treated or augmented water;

<DESC>This is an open solicitation notice for a class of contractual actions that will be procured under existing Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) for the manufacture of Neutron and Gamma Ray Shields in accordance with specifications created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Center for Neutron Research (NCNR).

The NIST/NCNR is a large laboratory facility consisting of a suite of instruments that measure the interaction of radiation with various materials to study their structure and properties.  The NCNR maintains a wide variety of instruments that allows great flexibility in the type of samples and phenomena that can be studied and measured.  

One common requirement on all instrumentation is radiation shielding, both to protect personal safety and to ensure the validity and purity of the data collected on the instruments.  Shielding varies according to the type and magnitude of the radiation being targeted, but in terms of volume, the vast majority of shielding consists of tanks or shells that are filled with a mixture of steel shot and paraffin wax.  Because of the goal of remaining a state-of-the-art neutron scattering facility, the NCNR continues to evolve by adding new instrumentation and upgrading existing instrumentation.  Part of this evolution is a continual, but highly variable need for new shielding.

This requirement may result in orders under the existing BOAs for purchasing completed Neutron and Gamma Ray Shields, custom-made to satisfy the parameters and specifications provided by the NCNR Engineering staff.

NIST intends to compete future requirements among and award orders to existing BOA holders based on the lowest proposed fixed price.  At this time, there are four BOA holders with BOAs for the period beginning March 10, 2006 through March 9, 2011.  To date, the cumulative total of orders placed under the BOAs is $145,000.

The four BOAs described above were competed via small business set-aside and awarded on a competitive basis in March 2006.  The solicitation, all associated documentation, and amendments were posted to Federal Business Opportunities at www.fbo.gov under solicitation number SB1341-05-R-0010.

Interested parties with the capability to manufacture Neutron and Gamma Ray Shields may respond to this notice with a written statement of capability.  The statement of capability will be reviewed by the NIST Technical Team.  The statement of capability may be followed by a Request for Proposal (RFP) package which will require the interested partys complete proposal in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation.  The party shall be permitted 45 days to respond to the request for proposal.  The RFP would reflect all of the requirements of SB1341 05 R 0010 updated with clauses and provisions in effect on the date the Government issues the RFP to a prospective Contractor.

NIST will evaluate the Contractors proposal in accordance with the evaluation criteria included in the solicitation.  Parties determined capable of performing the required work will be issued a Basic Ordering Agreement and will have the opportunity to compete among other BOA holders for future orders.

This notice shall remain open continuously throughout the period of performance of the Basic Ordering Agreements.  This notice will be amended on a quarterly basis, in order to provide specific notice of the number of solicitations for BOA orders issued within that quarter, and to update the cumulative award amount set forth above.  In no event will the cumulative orders placed under the BOAs exceed $1,500,000.

<DESC><BR>Title  IMPROVED SINGLE PIXEL FOURIER TRANSFORM INFARED (FTIR) DETECTION PERFORMANCE USING INSTANTANEOUS FIELD OF VIEW (IFOV) LESS THAN 18 millradians (1.0 DEGREE)<BR><BR>Request for Information (RFI)   The Joint Project Manager for Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance (JPM NBCCA) is conducting a field simulant demonstration with eighteen (18) milliradians (or smaller) instantaneous field of view (IFOV) single-pixel scanning FTIR standoff chemical agent detection systems.  The Government will be conducting field simulant tests at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) in Utah to investigate the reduced IFOV FTIR detection systems ability to detect, identify, and track chemical agent clouds at greater distances than FTIR detection systems with larger IFOV. <BR><BR>Key area of interest includes:<BR><BR>Understanding the differences in Time to Detect, Time to Identify, and Tracking performance of chemical vapor clouds using large IFOV versus reduced IFOV FTIR systems at standoff distances up to 5km from the dissemination location. Large IFOV FTIR systems are defined as systems with an IFOV greater than eighteen (18)  milliradians (1.0 degree).  <BR><BR>To this end, the JPM NBCCA is requesting whitepaper submissions to support a potential reduced IFOV versus large IFOV FTIR systems demonstration.  After review of industrys submissions, the Government may select candidates to demonstrate their systems from 04  15 May 2009 at DPG, UT.  The Government demonstrations will provide an opportunity for industry to demonstrate their single pixel reduced IFOV and large IFOV FTIR detection systems to address the Governments key area of interest.  The Government will be investigating the capability differences between each vendors small and large IFOV sensors, not the capability differences between sensors provided by different vendors. <BR> <BR>If a contractor does not have a large and small IFOV instrument for self comparison, but does possess a system that they feel could benefit from a data collection exercise as presented here, they should submit a white paper for consideration as the Government may allow the contractor to participate.  See para. 5) below.   <BR><BR>This notice constitutes a RFI.  All selected participants will be participating in the Government IFOV demonstration at their own expense.  For this demonstration, the Government will not be awarding contracts nor paying any of the contractors costs, expenses, or travel claims associated with this demonstration. Submission of a white paper does not guarantee selection for the IFOV demonstration. Selection of multiple participants is anticipated.  <BR><BR>WHITE PAPER PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION:  All responsible firms, corporations, organizations, including those within the U.S. Government, private industry, academic institutions, research institutions, non-profit organizations, etc., are encouraged to respond to this RFI by submitting a white paper.  There will be no opportunity for questions and answers associated with this RFI.  As a minimum, the submission should address the following:<BR> <BR>1) Brief Description of System or Technology and Capabilities.   Describe the overall system and its capabilities. Describe the key components and specifications of the system to include size, weight and power requirements, Noise Equivalent Spectral Radiance (NESR), IFOV of the two systems, spectral resolution, etc. <BR><BR>2)  Demonstration Plan.  Each contractor will be expected to provide at least one of their large IFOV FTIR systems and at least one of their reduced IFOV FTIR systems.  All contractors will be expected to have all their systems confidence checked, calibrated, and ready to operate at least 30 minutes prior to each scheduled release.  All contractors shall co-locate their systems with the other IFOV FTIR systems on the test site.  The Government will take appropriate measures to prevent the disclosure of contractors proprietary data to other co-located vendors.  Each contractor will operate, and maintain each of their FTIR systems.  All systems will be operated in accordance with (IAW) the Government test plan (see attached) for setup and location.  All of the FTIR systems will be scanning the same Field of Regard (FOR) defined by the Government, and both of the contractors FTIR systems will be running the same detection algorithm.  At the end of each test day, each contractor will be expected to provide processed detection results to the Government on a CD, DVD, or other similar media format.  The processed data shall clearly describe the simulant identity, relative azimuth and elevation extents from the sensor, initial detection time, initial identification time, and de-alert time.  The test plan is attached with this RFI.  Within 60 days after completion of the test, the Government will provide each participant with referee ground truth and met data.     <BR><BR>3) Cost.  The Government will provide two weeks of simulant testing at DPG.  The Government plans to give each participants detection system over forty eight (48) challenges of TriEthyl Phosphate (TEP) and Acetic Acid (AA).  The participants are expected to fully fund their participation in this demonstration. <BR><BR>4) Logistical support.  The Government will provide minimum logistical support to each contractor.  Support includes but is not limited to providing trucks to reposition systems, generators, gasoline, wireless network capability, etc.  The contractor shall request specific support desired from the Government in the white paper.    <BR><BR>5) Other Standoff Chemical Agent Systems.  Contractors that do not have systems that meet the Governments requirements outlined above may be invited as an opportunity to collect data that would otherwise be difficult to obtain.  These contractors will be participating on a non-interference basis.  At the end of each test day, the contractor will be expected to provide to the Government all processed detection data. <BR><BR>The white paper shall be limited to ten (10) pages (8.5 inches x 11 inches), of English text. It shall be single-spaced, 12 pitch with 1 inch left, right, top and bottom margin.  <BR><BR>All proprietary data that the participant  intends to be used only by the Government for evaluation purposes must be identified and appropriately marked.  See Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 3.104.4;52.215-1(e).  The participant must also identify all technical data contained in the white paper that is to be treated by the Government as subject to restrictive markings.  In the absence of such identification, the Government will assume to have unlimited rights to all technical data in the white paper.<BR> <BR>The white paper shall be submitted in Microsoft Word format and include an electronic copy on CD-ROM compatible with Microsoft Word 2003.  Participants are responsible to ensure electronic copies on CD-ROM are virus free.  Submissions are to be sent to the following address not later than April 3, 2009:<BR><BR>Dept of the Army<BR>Joint Project Manager for Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance <BR>Attention: SFAE-CBD-NBC-D (E4465 Linwood Halsey/Steve Kolodzey)<BR>5183 Blackhawk Road<BR>Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010  5424 <BR><BR><BR>This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government and does not imply an intention or the opportunity to acquire funding to support current or future development efforts.

Simulants will be AA or TEP.  See attached test matrix for days, releases and simulant quantities.<BR><BR>Number of Systems:<BR>	Government: 2 ea 0.50 IFOV, 2 ea 1.50 IFOV.  All will be co-located at the same site for each release.<BR>	Other Participants: There may be other Government or private organizations at this test.  Certain contractors, such as General Dynamics or Northrop Grumman, may participate depending on their individual responses to a Government RFI.  <BR><BR>Scan Pattern: Systems will be aimed at the release point. Relative azimuth extents will be approx -200 to + 200 degrees, and elevation extents will be approx -30 to + 70 degrees for both system types.     <BR><BR>Distance:  Systems will be on Downwind West at 2km or on November Road at 3, 4, or 5km. Once a distance is chosen, systems will remain there for the entire day.  <BR><BR>Day 4:  By the end of day 3, we expect to see some performance limits.  The Program Manager (PM) may adjust material quantities for one or both simulants, then keep this level as we move to re-establish detection capability.  Subsequent days will be decided on an ad hoc basis.<BR><BR>Ground Truth: <BR>	DPG: Since this is a PM (customer) conducted test, there is no requirement for specific cloud detection support from DPG.  The PM does require standard met condition information from DPG, such as temperature, RH, wind direction, speed, inversion layer height, etc.<BR>	Aerospace Standard Ground Trackers: Aerospace will be present with two of their ground trackers to provide accurate spatial and temporal cloud location, column density, background delta Ts, etc.  <BR>	Aerospace GBAS: Aerospace will be present with one GBAS system configured at a one mrad IFOV/pixel. <BR><BR><BR>Frequency Allocation:  <BR>	PM: The PM will require DPG supplied wireless radios as listed under DPG Responsibilities.<BR>	Aerospace:  Aerospace has used their own voice and data radios in the past and will use them during this test to communicate to their designated Command Post (CP) ground tracker van.    <BR>

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 13.5, the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order to University of California, Santa Barbara, to Develop a mathematical model based on a set of ordinary deferential equations (ODE) for the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on cardiovascular and thermoregulatory response to the heat stroke in vivo model, to Predict the efficacy of NSAIDs and identify optimal therapeutic windows for heat stroke recovery by applying Model Predictive Control (MPC) to the developed model, to Develop gene-/protein-level biophysical network models and analyze protein level data for identification of mechanisms of long-term heat injury progression, to Identify targets of intervention for optimal heat stress recovery using a systems approach to relate    gene-/protein-level biophysical network models with animal-scale model, to Identify biomarkers that predict outcome by system identification tools and by artificial intelligence. Apply MPC to calculate precise intervals of optimal target interventions to recover heat stress based on systems biology level model, and to Prepare final technical report and/or manuscript(s).<BR><BR>Recent work by Leon et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 100:  1400-1409, 2006) has established the long-term thermoregulatory, tissue injury and protein responses during heat stroke recovery in mice. University of California Santa Barbara /Dr. Doyles work in the area of optimized circadian resetting (Bagheri et al., 2008) has established modeling capabilities that support the prediction of intervention strategies for physiological reset. A working relationship has been established in so much that both investigators are up to speed on current work from both parties and they have previously collaborated on a project which was the basis for this current project.  Thus, this collaborative project will support the development of a systems biology initiative to mitigate heat injury in the Warfighter and develop predictive models related to determine the efficacy of pharmacological agents for the treatment of heat injury/ return to duty and determine how responses may differ in rodent populations that simulate physiological characteristics of special forces populations.<BR><BR>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<SUBJECT>Sole Source Procurement Notification for Picayune Strand Restoration Project, Merritt Pump Station
<SOLNBR>W912EP-09-Z-0004
<ARCHDATE>06182009
<CONTACT>Karla M. Garcia , 904 2321015

<a href="mailto:karla.m.garcia@saj02.usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, Jacksonville</a>
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to solicit on a Sole Source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Pump Stations Telemetry System which consists of brand name components such as: Ethernet Network Switches, MOSCAD Programmable Logic Controllers, Microwave Ethernet Bridges, Engine, motor, and station Programmable Logic Controllers, Surveillance Cameras and associated software, Central Control System SCADA software, Security Alarm Panels, Fire Alarm Panels, and Central Control System computers for the Picayune Strand Restoration Project. The telemetry system allows many water control structures to be operated and monitored remotely. It will operate 24 hours a day and will be designed to operate during hurricanes and other severe weather conditions. The Merritt Pumping Station will be part of a much larger system that South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) uses to remotely operate and monitor its structures. The anticipated dollar amount of the Sole Source System is $150,000.00.<BR><BR>The components listed above have been specifically selected due to their performance interoperability as part of an entire telemetry system.  Substitution with similar components could present a considerable risk to life and property.  The system as a whole provides standardization in training, maintenance, warehousing and interchangeability during potential life threatening weather events. <BR> <BR>The Picayune Strand Restoration Project (PSRP) will restore more than 55,000 acres of land located in southwestern Collier County, Florida to a healthy and functional wetland system. The plan for the Project is to remove the infrastructure of the subdivision and restore its pre-drainage hydrology and ecology, generating positive effects on the hydrology, vegetation and wildlife of the project area and surrounding public lands. The plan calls for the construction of  a pump station and tie-back levees, spreader cells and canal plugs to slow water flowing through existing canals and distribute it across the landscape. In addition, the existing road network within PSRP will be taken down to grade with a limited portion of the roads remaining above grade. It will have 4 220 cfs engine driven vertical pumps and 2 75 cfs electrical pumps for a firm capacity of 810 cfs. <BR><BR>The magnitude of construction of the PSRP is $25,000.00-$100,000,000.00. The work is in Collier County, Florida. A solicitation for the Picayune Strand Restoration Project, Merritt Pump Station will be issued on or about 30 April 2009 with proposals due on or about 16 June 2009.<BR><BR>Interested persons may identify their interest and capabilities to the work described in paragraph 1 and respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen calendars days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <BR><BR>Questions concerning this procurement may be addressed to Kathleen Duke at 904-232-3713 or email at Kathleen.B.Duke@usace.army.mil.  <BR>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF WORK: This is a notice of sole source intent to enter into a contract for PLANNING, EVALUATION, ANALYSIS, AND GUIDANCE FOR US ARMY HEALTH FACILITIES PLANNING AGENCY PROGRAMS. The Mobile District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate and award an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity type Task Order Contract with Noblis, Inc., McLean, VA, as a nonprofit, conflict-of-interest free source, who does not compete for design or construction<BR>projects for private or government entities, and who has a high degree of expertise in the military medical and medical/biosafety laboratory fields to provide support for strategic planning, program policy analysis, and decision-making support for the US Army Health Facilities Planning Agency <BR><BR>For further information, contact Jacalyn Jenkins 251-441-5598. The NAIC CODE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT IS 541618.<BR><BR>The following types of services are required: detailed market analysis and healthcare planning; economic analysis for capital improvement decisions; special studies related to changing healthcare requirements; program management support and facilitation, acquisition assistance; and advice to the government with regard to emerging technologies, shifts in practice trends, alternative future scenarios and funding strategies, etc. Respondents must demonstrate a broad capability in the medical and biodefense laboratory fields, including experience in high-level policy making, guidance and regulatory compliance.  This procurement will be subject to stringent organizational conflict-of-interest provisions and respondents must demonstrate an absence of such conflicts.  That is, the respondent is not engaged in other activities or relationships which would make the respondent unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the respondents objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or the respondent has an unfair competitive advantage.<BR><BR>The Health Facilities Planning Agency (HFPA) is responsible for the planning and execution of facility-related investments for hospitals, clinics, research and other medically-related facilities world-wide.  HFPA is seeking support with its initiatives to: assess planning and capital requirements for Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) installations in selected markets and  multi- markets;  recapitalize the existing Army medical care delivery, medical research, and biodefense laboratory inventory; shape and improve facilities in order to respond quickly and efficiently to the ever-changing face of Army and Military Health System (MHS) requirements; identify and use alternative business practices to leverage private industry capital in the development of Army facility projects; and, research emerging facility technologies and find opportunities to incorporate these technologies into the Army healthcare facility life cycle management process.<BR><BR>The contractor shall assist HFPA in gathering the information needed to acquire, allocate, and manage resources for HFPA military functions.  The contractor may be required to assist HFPA in considering and addressing impacts to its program as a result of troops restationing, BRAC announcements, and coordination and interfacing with the Services in multi-service markets.  The contractor will assist HFPA in conducting special studies, investigations, or focused analyses on a variety of healthcare related issues and topics.  These analyses may involve a focused area of inquiry or may involve assessment of a broad set of topics.  Such investigations will feature preparation of a special output document(s) which include policy recommendations and/or actionable items/recommendations that should be pursued and that can be referenced by HFPA.<BR><BR>In order to support HFPA in managing its program, the following characteristics will be required of the contractor:<BR>"	Independent and Objective.  To ensure credibility, consistency, and defensibility, the evaluation of contractor performance must be free of any perceived or actual bias, free from conflict of interest, and based on the best possible analysis and expertise.  It is imperative that there be no potential for a conflict of interest on the part of the organization providing the required essential technical capability.  HFPA must be able to trust this organization with sensitive, government-proprietary information without concern for its misuse.<BR>"	Access to HFPA Planning, Budgeting, and Acquisition Information.  Some activities require extensive access to planning, budgeting, and acquisition information.  Given the frequent restructuring of corporate ownership, it is difficult to ensure that the release of sensitive information to a profit-seeking entity is not going to eventually undermine the integrity of current or future procurements.  Even if there is no actual harm, the appearance of a conflict of interest could severely handicap HFPAs ability to act.  Actual organizational conflict of interest is not eliminated completely by temporary exclusion clauses that attempt to separate conflict-free portions of a company from other parts that could gain a competitive advantage through access to sensitive information, and none of these measures are effective against the appearance of a conflict of interest.<BR>"	Need for an Impartial Advisor.  There are many competing priorities within the HFPA operating entities and the requirement exists to engage an organization that can provide objective assessments and recommendations on both external and internal positions.  There is a continuing need to establish an objective resource to help HFPA sort out internal priorities and to represent a credible, independent input to the program management process.  This resource must have access to sensitive information and key decision makers, and have the mandate to provide neutral ground where internal priority conflicts can be examined and fairly resolved.<BR>"	Continuity of Effort.  Informed program management decisions require enlightened advice based on broad, in-depth, and enduring knowledge of the HFPA corporate culture and way of doing business.  The use of a profit-seeking contractor to provide such continuity would be unwise in this situation because it would be difficult to maintain continuity without giving unfair competitive advantage and inhibiting appropriate free and open competition.<BR>To fulfill its responsibilities with the highest level of efficiency and cost effectiveness, HFPA requires the support of an organization that can simultaneously:<BR>"	Provide a general program management support, which it has successfully applied to other large and complex systems,<BR>"	Have access, beyond that which is common to the normal contractual relationship, to government and private sector data, including sensitive and proprietary data, and to employees and facilities, and<BR>"	Operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence and with freedom from any organizational conflict of interest.<BR>The support of an experienced, conflict free contractor is particularly important to HFPA when its policy choices and decision making have long range and far reaching implications.<BR><BR>This support will be used to accomplish tasks that are integral to the mission and operation of HFPA, but it will not be used to perform inherently governmental functions or when the need can be met as effectively with in house resources or by other contract support gained via competition.  The contractor will be used when continuity of effort is critical, when the contractor possesses a unique and essential knowledge base, and/or when it is necessary to have access to sensitive or proprietary information, including strategic planning information.  The contractor will also be used when the nature of the work is such that it must be performed by an entity operating in the public interest,without profit motive, with objectivity and independence, and with freedom from organizational conflicts of interest.<BR><BR>The resultant contracts performance period will be a one-year base period with 4, one-year options. The maximum contract value for all years will be $10,000,000.00. This office believes that only one source, Noblis, Inc., can provide all of the above required support.  If any responsible source other than Noblis, Inc. can fulfill all of the above requirements, written notification and supporting documentation may be submitted in writing to: jacalyn.m.jenkins@usace.army.mil with a copy to cynthia.y.dunham@usace.army.mil, kristie.l.brock@usace.army.mil, and robert.s.mcallister@usace.army.mil U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, ATTN: CESAM-CT-C(Jacalyn M. Jenkins), P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628-0001 or jacalyn.m.jenkins@.usace.army.mil.  To be considered a viable source, documentation must clearly demonstrate: (1) freedom from actual or potential conflict-of-interest (2) extensive knowledge in each of the areas described in the requirements above (3) past history detailing any contracts that your company is currently performing or has completed that would be considered the same as/similar to the type of services described above.  Include the contract number, type of contract, dollar value, performance location, contract length, government point of contact and current phone number and (6) positive indication that your firm does not compete or bid for design, construction, or construction management project for private or government entities, and does not perform as a subcontractor for firms who do compete on these projects.  If no affirmative written documentation is received within 15 calendar days (03 May 2006) of this synopsis, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers will proceed with negotiations to issue a contract to Noblis, Inc.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided.  The results of this synopsis will be considered to be in effect for a period of six months from the date of publication of this notice.  A solicitation is not available. <BR><BR> <BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Application for Brand Name JustificationEach justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As required of FAR 6.302-1( c ), each justification shall include the following information: 1.  Requesting Agency:	U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Corporate Data Center Operations, Austin Information Technology CenterContracting activity:	Center for Acquisition Innovation, Information Technology Acquisition Center, 1615 Woodward Street, Austin, TX 787722.  Nature and/or description of the action:  The CDCO operates a z890 series IBM server, model 2086-320 at its campus in Austin, Texas.  This is a 131 MIP mainframe processor installed in January 2006.  The CDCO is preparing paperwork and seeking approval to replace this machine with a more current model, most likely an IBM z10 BC 2098-M03.  This Brand Name Justification has been prepared to document that IBM is the only brand name that meets the governments requirements.  This is due to a lack of competition by other vendors in the IBM Compatible Marketplace.3.  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):Both supplies and services are required in order to accomplish the replacement.  A z10 series server will be delivered to the CDCO, configured appropriately for CDCO requirements.  Services will be provided to install it and make it ready for use.  The estimated value is omitted because it will appear in other paperwork related to this initiative.4.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.This requirement is justified by FAR 6.302-1 ( c ) Application for brand name descriptions.5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition that requires use of the authority cited.Historically there have been alternatives to IBM Brand Name servers which would run the IBM operating system.  Amdahl and Fujitsu are two companies that had products in this market.  The CDCO used Amdahl equipment in the 1980s.  These vendors left the marketplace in 2000.  The CDCO requires a 398 MIP (minimum), 96GB memory, 64 bit server capable of running the z/OS version 1.10 operating system; running z/VM 5.3 operating system; capable of linking with an existing IBM z9 mainframe via their coupling facility and Integrated Cluster Bus links; run all 3rd party vendor software currently running on the IBM z890; and capable of supporting FICON connectivity to EMC DASD.  No vendor except IBM has a product meeting this specification.  CDCO staff researched this information using Gartner online resources.  Platform Solutions, Inc. (PSI) was previously a company that had entered the large-scale IBM compatible marketplace, but was bought out by IBM.  CDCO analysts previously identified T3 Technologies as a company in the IBM compatible marketplace; however it is marketed for small-scale operations and is not capable of meeting the specifications.  For example, its largest server is rated at 350 MIPS and max memory is only 64GB are at least 2 factors disqualifying it.6.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.This requirement will be solicited using the AACES V200P-909 contract. The existing hardware to be upgraded is under warranty and maintained under this contract, therefore any modifications must be pursued using this contract vehicle to maintain continuity of warranties and services. 7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.The anticipated costs of $x.xx Million associated with this technical refresh are fair and reasonable8.  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.CDCO staff reviewed Gartner research to determine if there were viable products from other manufacturers besides IBM.  The results are detailed in answer to Question 5 above.9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competitionNo other information provided10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.None11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.Future requirements of this kind will be evaluated to determine the current government need and the appropriate level of competition in accordance with current federal law, regulation and policy.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue, Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  532952.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for emergency Medicar transportation services for the VA Hines Hospital.  Procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with three established medical transportation firms with Jay Transportation, Royal System Services Corporation, and SCR Medical Transportation.3.	A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  VA Hines Hospital has a requirement for Emergency 24 hour Medicar Transportation Services.   4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2.  The VA's minimum needs are Unusual and Compelling Urgency based on the fact that the current transportation contract will expire on February 28, 2009 without further provisions to extend.  It is for the betterment of patient care to procure transportation services from the firms identified.  5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The Contracting Officer had issued a solicitation for transportation services for VA Hines Hospital.  Proposals were received and evaluated.  The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) recommended awarding the contract to a firm.  Services are currently being provided to Hines VA Hospital by that firm.  The Contract Review Board (CRB) concluded that there were deficiencies in both of the proposals that were evaluated by the SSEB and that the SSEB was not consistent in following the prescribed Source Selection Plan.  Although the written intent of the solicitation was to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions, due to proposal deficiencies, the CRB determined that discussion would be necessary.  However, in the course of the CRB meeting it was further determined that discussion and subsequent award would not meet VA's goals for transportation of veteran patients.  The final decision of the CRB was for the Contracting Officer to cancel the solicitation and during the interim; the following plan would be followed until a one year with two one-year options contract can be established:	Extend the current contract through February 28, 2009 to allow for emergency contracts to be awarded. 	Issue a RFQ to three known contractors due to urgent and compelling needs at VA Hines.  Past history and current performance indicators suggest that the transportation needs of VA Hines exceeds the capacity of a single provider.  By utilizing numerous contractors, it is the expectation that each of the contractors would be able to better utilize their resources in responding to scheduled daily trips.  The three emergency contracts will be issued by geographic areas:o	North of Highway 38o	South of Highway 38o	Indiana/Michigan	Establish competitive BPA with a minimum of four (4) small businesses to handle all unscheduled or add-on trips.  The current contractor provides approximately 3,000 trips per month.  The trips are scheduled 24 hours in advance.  When additional trips are added to the schedule it results in delays.  The BPA providers will only be used for transport of patients who were not scheduled 24 hours in advance.  This will eliminate waiting times for patients.The emergency contracts and BPA will be awarded for six months which is the estimated time for the Contracting Officer to award a new contract.  Page 2A solicitation was issued to procure the services of a Transportation Consultant.  These services will include:	Evaluate current contractor provided Patient Transportation Services Program	Evaluate implementation and monitoring of the resulting contract	Develop Statement of Work of the resulting contract	Develop performance monitors and standards	Develop Standard Operating Procedures	Baseline, bi-weekly, final written assessments	Quarterly reports	Site visits  The need for emergency contracts is essential in order to prevent services interruption.6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  There are currently three (3) firms who responded to a recent solicitation to provide transportation services for VA Hines Hospital.  These firms will be issued emergency contracts until a long-term contract can be competed and awarded.7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  The cost of the services is anticipated to be similar to the proposed unit costs of the offeror whose price proposal was evaluated and determined to be fair and reasonable.  8.	Market survey conducted:  An internet search was completed.9.	Other facts:  None10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.PATRICE R.

<DESC><p>Description:
<p>This is a solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 12. This announcement constitutes a Request for Quotation; proposals are being requested. Solicitation number FM460082700165 is issued as a request for quotation. Funds are currently available.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 339114. The business size standard is 500 employees. Offutt AFB intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the following items:</p>
<p>Line Item:<br />Nobleguide Software: Nobel Biocare is the only known manufacturer of NobelGuide implant planning software.</p>
<p>Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or</p>
<p>(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)</p>
<p>NobelGuide is revolutionary planning software that will allow the practitioner to virtually plan his/her dental implant surgery cases based on each patient's CT scan data. Its primary applications are in the fields of prosthodontics, periodontics and oral surgery. It can be used for storing, retrieving, displaying, and printing digital, radiographs (X-rays), and digital images of dental models. Once images have been stored, they may be shown to patients for educational purposes or printed to provide "hard copies" of patients' digital radiographs. <br /><br />Additionally, NobelGuide enables the restorative dentist or surgical dentist to compose customized referral letters with embedded dental model or radiographic images. It, therefore, improves communication between dental care providers.</p>
<p>The 2D and 3D images provided by NobelGuide gives the dentist a clear picture of patient anatomy as well as the ability to develop customized treatment plans accordingly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, NobelGuide assists surgeons in developing restoratively driven surgical treatment plans. NobelGuide is based on planning algorithms used clinically for more than 11 years, which can help deliver predictable and precise results by integrating accurate laboratory prosthetic models, CT scan data, and their clinician-friendly 3D planning software.</p>

The intent and purpose of the investigation are to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful contract completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior. The contract employee must furnish all required data in the form and format determined by the United States Attorney (USA) or his/her duly authorized representative. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, with a concurrent copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), of the results of the investigation.

4.7.2.2 Risk Level

In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk categories as described below:

High Risk Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:


 Policy development or implementation

 Higher-level management assignment

 Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,

 Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 

 IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are High Risk at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130appendix_iii.html).

Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:

 Assistance to policy development and implementation,

 Mid-level management assignments,

 Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

 Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,

 IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).

Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.

4.7.2.3 Types and Numbers of Background Investigations

Work performed under this BPA will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 4.7.2.2. As a result, the Contractor's personnel must undergo a background investigation commensurate with the assessed risk category. In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this BPA.

The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the BPA until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.

During the life of the BPA, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.

4.7.2.4 Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers

Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order. However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver. The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position. A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor. When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor, the employee should be removed from the contract. Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 

High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subjects background during the past 5 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Low Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a Federal Bureau of Investigation Name and Fingerprint check. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check.

4.7.2.5 The following forms and submission dates shall be adhered to by the Contractor for each type of investigation listed below. The forms shall be submitted to the designated COTR or point of contact within seven days after receipt of the forms.

Title and Number of Form No. of Copies

FD-258 Fingerprint Card 2
SF 85P - Questionnaire For 2
Public Trust Positions

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on: 1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities. If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA. In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(c) Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness. Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees. If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required. The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures. If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations. The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees. This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract. Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted. The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

(d) The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
changes.

(g) The motivation for the conduct.

(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract. However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel. In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA. In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated. The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants. If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals. Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year. The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein. The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character. Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character. Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15 Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required. 

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause. The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3 Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel. Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody. The USA may at his/her discretion retain custody of the material, including notes, tapes, drafts, etc., and require all transcribing and typing of the grand jury information be done within the USAO.

4.7.3.3 The Contractor shall hold inviolate and in the strictest confidence any and all information of an official character which he/she may gain in the performance of his/her duties under this agreement.

4.7.4 Contractor Physical Security Requirements

4.7.4.1 Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person. The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area. When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows: 
o Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material. 
o Covered, turned face down, placed in storage containers, or otherwise protected when unauthorized persons are present. 
o The room containing the materials must be locked when vacated for short periods of time. 
o Returned to storage containers as soon as practicable after use. Grand jury material shall not be removed from the premises of the court reporter for transcription except for delivery to the USAOs. Approved storage containers include: the GSA Class 6 security container; a lock-bar file cabinet (with a GSA approved lock); or 3-position dial safe. 

4.7.4.2 An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) must be installed connected to a central station at the Contractors facility or the facility of a subcontractor who monitor the IDS and guard or law enforcement response to the Grand Jury processing area must occur within 15 minutes of alarm activation. Central station burglar alarm systems classified by the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. or other systems with built-in auxiliary power for fail safe protection, shall satisfy this requirement. (Such system shall not use shunt switches to shut off control panels and all alarm sensors and control boxes should be equipped with tamper-proof switches). A direct-connect or remote station alarm system (i.e., a system connected by direct wire to alarm receiving equipment located in a local police department headquarters, which is activated and deactivated by the using Contractor and responded to by personnel of the local police department) may be utilized. If the contracting firm is housed in a building with a 24 hour guard service, the IDS requirement may be waived. The representative of the Contractor shall be required to report immediately to the facility to ascertain the nature of the alarm and to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of area concerned. 

4.7.4.3 End-of-day security checks shall be performed within the contract facility to ensure that precautions are taken to protect grand jury material. The court reporter firm shall designate an individual or individuals, to make daily checks to ensure all grand jury material has been properly stored.

4.7.4.4 The Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative, of the USAO, shall have the right to inspect at reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the procedures, equipment, and facilities used by the Contractor to comply with these requirements.

4.7.4.5 If the contractor is unable to provide the required physical security in his/her workplace, a work area and storage space for Grand Jury transcript processing will be provided at the USAO.

4.7.5 Information Technology

4.7.5.1 Information Technology Equipment refers to computers, steno machines, transcription devices, printers, scanners, and all other technological devices used to electronically process grand jury information for the USAO.

4.7.5.2 When grand jury court reporters process grand jury information outside the USAO while utilizing Information Technology equipment that is not the property of the USAO, the equipment will be used in a dedicated, stand-alone, single user mode (no network capability). The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 

4.7.5.3 In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.

4.7.5.4 When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media. In addition, temporary files must be deleted from the grand jury court reporters equipment using the currently approved USAO sanitization method.

Unauthorized personnel must not be permitted to view any grand jury information. The equipment must be turned off, or otherwise disabled, when not in use.

4.7.5.6 The removable media must be stored in an approved security container or lockable file cabinet (in accordance with 6.C.1) after normal working hours or when the equipment is not in use. 

4.7.5.7 All printed output material must be protected. USAO personnel must ensure this requirement is adhered to and documented in the Grand Jury Inspection Reports. 

4.7.5.8 Only appropriately-cleared maintenance personnel escorted and monitored by USAO personnel or court reporter service personnel are allowed to perform on-site maintenance for the equipment. The USAO must grant approval before maintenance of the PC is allowed. The storage media must be removed from the PC prior to removal of the PC from the area for maintenance. 

4.7.5.9 Grand jury information should be backed up on a weekly basis. Grand jury information may not be processed by individuals outside of those contracted and granted security approval. 

4.7.6 Security of Systems and Data, Including Personally Identifiable Data.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database;

The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages). These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens. A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite Contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval. Each waiver request will be reviewed by the DSO and a determination made on a case-by-case basis.

Additionally, a Contractor employee who is not a U.S. citizen must be from a country allied with the United States. Since the countries on the Allied Countries List are subject to change, the head of the Component shall review the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm.


D. 2 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National Emergency 

Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

 Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

 Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

 Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

 Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

 Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

 Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

 With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

 Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

 Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.

 Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

 Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractors responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance Emergency Acquisitions, May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations

(4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(1) [ ] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541519. The reference number for this Request for Quote (RFQ) is 88G69007AS04. Note that the Period of Performance (PoP) is expected to be approximately 01 Apr 2009 - 31 Mar 2010.  NGA plans to issue a firm fixed price purchase order under FAR Part 12 and 13. The requirement is for the following items:

1) Quantity of 64, GeoExpress Maintenance Agreements (Part # 101-036-7R) 

2) Quantity of 3, GeoExpress Solaris Maintenance Agreements (Part # 104-028-R) 

3) Quantity of 2, NITF Module Maintenance Agreements (Part # 101-03-7) 

4) Quantity of 2, GeoExpress Express Server Maintenance Agreements (Part # 301-022-7)


BRAND NAME GEOEXPRESS ANNUAL SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE 

The National Geospatial Intelligence-Agency has a requirement for annual software maintenance agreements as outlined above.  All of the items referenced in this posting are proprietary products of LizardTech.  LizardTech is the sole manufacturer of the GeoExpress suite of products and annual maintenance.  GeoExpress software provides a unique capability for compressing information using wavelet compression without a loss of data.  This allows products to be made smaller in size and then transmitted through communication paths with limited bandwidth.  Other forms of compression software would result in a loss of information when uncompressed and would not be compatible with unique NGA systems.  Furthermore, due to the fact that this software is already integrated into the NGA enterprise it would be extremely costly to switch to a new type of software.  Personnel would have to be trained to use the new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to implementation of the new software. The GeoExpress suite of software is the only product that fulfills the form, fit, and function requirements of NGA at this time. 

Vendor must be an authorized reseller of LizardTech GeoExpress products. 

Vendor shall quote all or none of the listed items. 

Delivery is FOB Destination. Delivery will be made to: NGA Washington Navy Yard, 1200 First Street SE, Washington, DC 20303.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NESDIS Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Team intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with NLETS (National Law Enforcement Telecommunications Systems) , Inc. using the procedures in FAR Parts 6 and 13. The National Weather Service, Office of the Dissemination Systems Branch, has a requirement to provide membership with NLETS. This membership will provide critical data exchange throughout the United States.<br /><br />The National Weather Service, Office of the Dissemination Systems Branch, produces meteorological and other public safety-oriented products that must be delivered to users as quickly as possible, often to safeguard life and property. NLETS operates a unique, highly efficient nationwide data exchange network that links state, local, federal, and international public safety agencies. NLETS maintains the telecommunications circuits and computer facilities, and all agencies within each state are serviced. Establishing an NLETS membership and using the NLETS backbone will allow NWS to greatly improve it's mission-critical requirement to deliver time-sensitive data to first-line responders, who must frequently take actions to ensure the public safety during emergencies. This is critical to NWS plans to improve information exchange, and the consequences of not utilizing this service will be a greatly diminished capability to provide users with much needed information relating to public safety and environmental hazards".
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Law Enforcement Telecommunications Systems (NLETS) is the only known source for a computer-based message switching capability that links together state, local and federal agencies for the purpose of information exchange. The goal and objective of the NLETS (National Law Enforcement Telecommunications Systems) membership is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of information sharing between NWS, the states, and other federal agencies. The membership provides access to existing NLETS (National Law Enforcement Telecommunications Systems) telecommunications infrastructure nationwide, which links 30,000 agencies in all 50 states, most federal agencies, and other partners with a state of the art, high speed, secure frame relay network. This access will allow time sensitive data to be delivered much more efficiently to users at both the state and federal level. The NLETS data exchange network is unique in that it is the only telecommunications network linking so many state and federal agencies together for the purpose of improved public safety. Links to federal and international systems are also provided in much the same manner. There is no other entity that can provide the NWS with such extensive telecommunications services.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 519190, small business size $6.5million, in dollars. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Amy.Sanderswhite@noaa.gov or faxed to (301) 713-0806 by April 4, 2009. Award will be made using FAR 13, Simplified acquisition procedures, current through FAC 2005-30. The determination to compete or not compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p><br />Delivery of interim and final report(s) shall be made to the NOAA COR and contracting officer that will be identified at time of award.</p>
<p>Timely proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Contracting Officer shall make a best value award decision based on the following evaluation factors: Proposals will be evaluated against the requirements of the RFP and in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth below to determine the Offeror's demonstrated ability to perform the services required. General statements such as "the vast resources of our nationwide company will be used to perform the services required by the Statement of Work" are not sufficient. The Offeror shall clearly address each element of the proposal. Any proposal failing to address all of the elements may be considered indicative of the Offeror's lack of understanding in response to the Government's requirements and may be considered unacceptable. Factor I - Technical Concept- the Technical Concept meets the requirement utilizing commercially available products and services to the maximum extent possible. The technical concept is clear, concise and complete. Factor II - Organizational Resources -The Offeror demonstrates an ability to provide the proposed service through one or more of the following subfactors: documented ownership of necessary assets; documented investor interest; and maturity of business case including independent review or valuation. Factor III Past Performance - Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual sales of similar studies or services to industry or government agencies (contractor format for past performance data is desired). Past performance will consider the reviews/ratings of other users who presently use or used offerors services. Offerors must include records of at least three recent sales, within the last 5 years, and identify a point of contact for each by providing a name and telephone number. Failure to submit past performance information (or to address past performance) with your proposal will result in your proposal being made non responsive. Factor IV - Price. The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the proposal. To ensure sufficient information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material necessary for the Government to determine whether the services/study meets technical requirements. Technical capability combined with past performance is significantly more important than price, and the contracting officer may make award to other than the lowest priced offeror. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.</p>

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  In addition to the instruction in this clause, Offerors must submit the following proposal content:<BR><BR>	Statement of Compliance:  The offer shall include a statement indicating complete compliance with the solicitation, or detailed analysis of any objections, exceptions, contingencies, or additions.  Any objection, exception, contingency, or addition shall be cross-referenced to the applicable solicitation paragraph(s).  <BR><BR>	Technical Approach:  The Offeror shall provide product literature, specification information cross-indexed to applicable parts of the SOW and warrantly provisions.   The Offerors proposal shall clearly demonstrate its ability to meet or exceed the SOW specifications and identify all systems with which the sensors are compatible.  The proposal must also demonstrate the ability to perform engineering support.  Statements that the Offeror understands and will meet the SOW requirements are inadequate.  Paraphrasing or reiteration of the SOW or parts thereof is similarly inadequate, as are phrases such as standard procedures will be employed or well-known techniques will be used.<BR><BR>	Past Performance:  The Offeror shall submit a list of up to five (5) contracts awarded where the Offeror has previously provided the same Optical Sensors. This section shall contain; model number, quantity sold, delivery schedule of previous contracts, and evidence of the products ability to interoperate with external systems.  Include the names of the Procuring Contracting Officer and Contracting Officers Representative along with their telephone numbers.<BR><BR>	Price:  Offerors shall provide completed pricing for CLINS 0001 and 0005. <BR><BR>(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies to this acquisition.<BR>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Technical, Past Performance and Price.  Technical is significantly more important than Past Performance.  Past Performance is significantly more important than Price.  The combination of non-priced factors is significantly more important than Price. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than Satisfactory must be achieved for Technical.  The degree of importance allocated to the Price will increase as the Offerors proposals become more equal in the other evaluation areas.  Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the Offeror with the lowest price.  <BR>All proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel.  Support contractors will not participate as members of or advisors to the source selection team. <BR><BR>        1. TECHNICAL EVALUATION APPROACH.  The evaluation process will consider the following:<BR>a. The products ability to meet or exceed the SOW specifications.<BR>b. The Offeror identifying all systems in which the Optical Sensors are compatible with.<BR>c. The Offerors ability to provide engineering support.<BR><BR>	2.  PAST PERFORMANCE  EVALUATION APPROACH.  The Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an Offerors likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that Offerors record of past performance. <BR>   		a. The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the Offerors ability to meet the specifications set forth in the SOW.  Areas of relevance will include if the Offeror has past performance of similar contracts to that which is detailed in the RFP.  When assessing performance risk, the Government will focus its inquiry on the past performance of the Offeror as it relates to all solicitation requirements.  These requirements include all aspects of schedule, performance and supportability, including the Offerors record of: 1) conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship; 2) adherence to contract schedules; 3) the proven ability of the Offeror to overcome integration and interoperability issues.  <BR>   <BR>   		b. In conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the Offerors proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the Offeror, it is incumbent upon the Offeror to explain the relevance of the data provided. While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the Offeror.<BR>   <BR>	3.  PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH. In evaluating the Price Factor, the Government will perform a price analysis to determine the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed prices in accordance with FAR 15.404.  <BR><BR>		a.

declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(2) (<span>&nbsp; </span>) Have, (<span>&nbsp; </span>) have not, within a three-year period
preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with
obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local

preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following
criteria apply:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability
is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the
case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer
is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where
enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(ii) Examples.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of
deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.<span>&nbsp; </span>6212,
which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax
deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax
liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final
tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with
respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. Sec.<span>&nbsp; </span>6320 entitling the
taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the
lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to
sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled
to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior
opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it
is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will
not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial
appeal rights.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement
pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.<span>&nbsp; </span>6159. The
taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement
terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently
required to make full payment.</p>

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC><p><strong>AMENDMENT #1 of Solicitation H92240-09-T-0015 is issued to extend the quote reciept date to be due no later than&nbsp;12:00 PM PST on March 24, 2009,&nbsp;&nbsp;and to incorporate the following responses to Request for Information.</strong></p>
<p>1. QUESTION: Must a full training syllabus accompany the proposal?</p>
<p>ANSWER: No. The syllabus would be developed in consultation with the NSW Recruiting Directorate and its East Coast Director within 30 days after award.</p>
<p>2. QUESTION: What will be the average class size?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The sum total will likely be 10 - 20 men but it is expected to grow with the success of this program. It will vary based upon the number of Fleet candidates assigned temporary duty to prepare for BUD/S, and availability of other potential candidates. The Contractor would be responsible for training whoever comes.</p>
<p>3. QUESTION: Will more than one training class be required to operate at the same time?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Only one instructor will be hired. That instructor will work closely with the local NSW RD personnel to determine the training class schedule. It should be anticipated that there will be different levels of swimming experience among the candidates requiring varied levels of instructional attention. It will be the responsibility of the instructor in consultation with the NSW RD personnel to determine if individual training sessions based on ability or single sessions of varied ability are preferable.</p>
<p>4. QUESTION: How much lead time is the candidate given to prepare before attending formal NSW training?</p>
<p>ANSWER: This will vary according to the individual candidate's orders and assignment to temporary duty. The instructor is not required to fully prepare candidates for BUD/S training. That will be accomplished through existing pipeline programs. The instructor will be expected to best assist each candidate for follow-on training within the timeframe afforded to each candidate. Individual training plans are to take into consideration expected time on station.</p>
<p>5. QUESTION: Will any of the candidates previously have failed BUD/S and require remedial training?</p>
<p>ANSWER: A few candidates coming from the Fleet may have previously attended BUD/S training and dropped on request or been disenrolled for performance. They would be using this swimming program to regain a competitive edge to try again. This program, however, is not designed to train active duty sailors for personal competitive events outside BUD/S, only to help them improve for follow-on BUD/S training.</p>
<p>6. QUESTION: Must the attendees complete a certain number of training session hours per day or per week?</p>
<p>ANSWER: This is a full-time (40 hours per week) instructor position. The instructor must be available to support an appropriate level of training hours agreed upon by the instructor, the candidates, and the NSW RD personnel. There are no minimum or maximum hours of candidate participation. Some of the candidates will be working out on a not-to-interfere basis with their regular duties and as such may require instruction outside normal working hours for which the Contractor would we responsible within a total 40 hour work schedule.</p>
<p>7. QUESTION: Aside from the Government provided items in paragraph 8.0, is the Contractor responsible for providing any other equipment they deem necessary (e.g. weights, obstacle course, etc.) for the candidate to use toward achieving a successful PST score?</p>
<p>ANSWER: No.</p>
<p>8. QUESTION: Will any regular NSW staff be onsite to monitor the training?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The NSW RD personnel's office is adjacent to the training pool and will provide support, assistance, and monitoring as needed.</p>
<p>9. QUESTION: For paragraph 4.4 (Step 1), will NSW provide a copy of the BUD/S PST criteria for the Contractor to follow during the intake evaluation of each candidate?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes.</p>
<p>10. QUESTION: Is it alright to design a program where active duty sailors and civilians train together, or does NSW require separate classes for each group?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Civilians are not scheduled to be trained, only recruited.</p>
<p>11. QUESTION: Will the contractor have an opportunity to review to medical profiles of each class member?<br />ANSWER: Medical profiles will not be provided.</p>
<p>12. QUESTION: Since diversity outreach activities are also required, does this mean the classes will only include members of minority groups, or is race not a factor?</p>
<p>ANSWER: No. Race is not a factor in class group training of active duty personnel. The composition of each training group would be discussed with the NSW RD personnel.</p>
<p>13. QUESTION: With regard to paragraph 4.4 (Step 4), can NSW provide support from an experienced teams member to share insights, etc. with the training class?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes. This would be arranged through the NSW RD personnel.</p>
<p>14. QUESTION: Is the Contractor outreach program limited to the general Norfolk area and only HBCUs and related swimming associations, or may the Contractor recommend a more comprehensive recruitment methodology in their proposal which might incorporate a larger catchment area?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The contractor is welcomed to make additional recommendations. However, the initial intent of the diversity portion of this contract is to use the Norfolk area, where a sizable minority population resides, as the test bed for follow-on efforts.</p>
<p>15. QUESTION: Is the outreach program goal only intended to focus on college students?</p>
<p>ANSWER: No.</p>
<p>16. QUESTION: As needed, will support be available from the WARCOM diversity officer during off base visits to help introduce the NSW program?<br /><br />ANSWER: Yes.</p>
<p><br />17. QUESTION: Should an outreach advertising budget be included in the proposal?<br /><br />ANSWER: No.</p>
<p>18. QUESTION: What kind of marketing and/or informational literature will NSW provide the Contractor to facilitate the outreach effort?<br /><br />ANSWER: All necessary marketing and informational materials to support outreach efforts will be provided by the Government as needed. These materials could include but not be limited to: CDs; posters; flyers; and, static displays.</p>
<p>19. QUESTION: Under section 52.212-2 (Evaluation-Commercial Items), paragraph (b), it says, "The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement."<br />Please explain what part of the solicitation is the "basic requirement" and what part(s) are "options".</p>
<p>ANSWER: This solicitation only has a basic requirement; it does not contain any options. Therefore, Paragraph (b) of Clause 52.212-2 is not applicable to this solicitation.</p>
<p>20. QUESTION: The evaluation criteria notes that past performance will be an evaluation criteria. Are the resumes of individual staff with regard to swim instruction, physical training, nutrition and diversity outreach experience sufficient to meet this standard?</p>
<p>ANSWER: There is no specific guidance for the submission of appropriate resumes other than that the resume of the prospective on-site instructor should be sufficient to allow for proper evaluation of that person's past performance.</p>
<p>21. QUESTION: Section 4.4 (Step 3: Training). <br />What are the time requirements for the individuals in the course?<br />- The length of the classes 2 week, 4 weeks, 10 weeks, etc.<br />- Are the classes set up in quarterly, bi-yearly, or yearly schedule?<br />- Are the classes taught everyday Mon-Fri <br />- What time is required for each training day 2hrs, 4hrs, etc?<br />O Swim instruction time required per day<br />O Running instruction time required per day<br />O Calisthenics instruction time required per day<br />O Warm-ups/Flexibility instruction required per day<br />Since the swimming part of the program is the most involved part.</p>
<p>ANSWER: The time requirements for the course will vary depending on the number of candidates and successful completion of the objectives. The contractor will coordinate with the SEAL &amp; SWCC Scout Team East Coast Program Director, and the WARCOM Diversity Officer, to set up regularly offered courses. As a general rule the classes will be taught Mon-Fri; however, weekends may be utilized if deemed advantageous. Each training day will generally be 8 hours but will require flexibility. Good figures for planning purposes are: warm up, running, and calisthenics (2 hours); and swim training (2 - 3 hours). The remainder of the day will be miscellaneous administration and the development and execution of various diversity outreach activities.</p>
<p>22. QUESTION: The American Red Cross only allows that a certified instructor teaches 10-1 for the student / instructor ratio. Will there be more than 10 individuals with the swim instructor at one time? <br /><br />ANSWER: Safety is paramount in all training evolutions. Based on the availability of other instructor cadre, there may be more than 10 candidates at a time.</p>
<p>23. QUESTION: What will be the "MAX" number of individuals that will be allowed in the pool at one time with the instructor?<br /><br />ANSWER: With swim instruction, the most advantageous to the students is a class size of no more than 15. The optimum class size is 8-10 students. The max capacity of the NAB Little Creek Pool is 164 people in the pool and 48 around the pool. This is based on Bureau of Medicine Chapter 4: "the maximum number of bathers in a swimming pool at any one time will not exceed one bather for each 50 square feet of water surface."</p>
<p>24. QUESTION: Will there be a lifeguard on duty at all times when individuals are in the water. The instructor (is a lifeguard) they can not lifeguard a pool and teach at the same time when they have a class. This is RED CROSS standard.</p>
<p>ANSWER: This will be coordinated with the East Coast Program Director.</p>
<p>25. QUESTION: Did you want the classes to be taught under the guild lines of the RED CROSS?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The instruction should adhere to government and professional clinical standards.</p>
<p>26. QUESTION: Section 4.7/4.8 Training session schedules<br />You mention classes could be taught before 0730 and after 1600 Mon-Fri<br />How early (time) could the classes start? <br />How late (time) could the classes end?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Flexibility is critical with training sessions. Classes may start as early as 6 AM and could go as late as 7 PM.</p>
<p>27. QUESTION: Section 7.0 Place of Performance<br />You mention travel in the local Norfolk area, could the contractor visit the surrounding areas around Norfolk (Tidewater VA)<br />Tidewater consist of the following surrounding cities<br />Virginia Beach (largest city in VA), Chesapeake, Hampton (Hampton University), Suffolk, Newport News and Williamsburg and Norfolk (Norfolk State) which make up the 7 cities in the Tidewater area. <br />Not only the local colleges, can the contractor visit all USA Swim teams in the Tidewater area along with the local swim clubs and High Schools?<br />We have a large number of individuals who swim on certain USA SWIM TEAMS who live in Norfolk but swim with a team in another city.</p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes, it is expected that travel will be necessary out of the Norfolk area and will be handled based on federal government regulations.</p>
<p>28. QUESTION: Section 8.0 Government Furnished Equipment<br />Will the government supply swimming equipment for the training of the individuals?<br />- Fins<br />- mask<br />- Snorkels<br />- Goggles<br />- Kickboards<br />These items help in the training of individuals in the water.</p>
<p>ANSWER: The government will supply all equipment.</p>
<p>29. QUESTION: Will there be a place to store the swimming equipment that is used in the pool training?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes.</p>
<p>30. QUESTION: Will there be weight training? And if so, is the government supplying the weight lifting equipment or location?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes, this will be handled at the discretion of the contractor and will need to be coordinated with the East Coast Program Director.</p>
<p>31. QUESTION: Section 9.0 Qualifications<br />You mentioned the swim instructor shall be a qualified lifeguard, CPR qualified, and previous swim coach. My QUESTION here, do you want the swim instructor to be WSI Certified? (Water Safety Instructor) This person can teach proper stroke development.</p>
<p>ANSWER: WSI is not a requirement.</p>
<p>32. QUESTION: What is the limit or Max number of individuals that will be allowed in the program at one time?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The intention is not to limit the number of candidates allowed in the program.</p>
<p>33. QUESTION: In order to determine a price, we would need to know how many students will need training.</p>
<p>ANSWER: Program will contain 10-20 students at outset, could grow as program matures. Class sizes will vary, depending on schedule availability of different students.</p>

The Allsteel Relate chair provides a superior ergonomic seating option as the flexibility of this chair improves pressure distribution, superior back support, improves mental focus, productivity while reducing neck and eye strain. The adaptive pivoting motion provides continuous back support while encouraging movement. Movement while sitting reduces fatigue and keeps discs healthy. Adjustment levelers are easy to reach to encourage adjustment through out the day to provide custom support for different tasks. This also encourages the users to adjust the seating as different people us the same chair and not set in a miss adjusted chair.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Amendment III: This amendment posts answers to questions, provides additional posted reference material and changes the due date for quotes. 

Question: 

1.	"The RFP makes reference to advance simulation software as analysis tool. Is there specific simulation software in mind that need to be considered? Or we, as contractor, need to recommend an existing software (i.e. Synchro, Vissum, Vissem, Paramatrics, etc...)for use?"

Answer: 

 We do not require that the contractor use any specific software.  

2.	"The documentation makes reference to limitation of historic data for implemented TMT, and suggest that previous study determined that simulation can be used! Isn't field data collection required for input data into simulation model & calibration? If so, how intensive is the field data collection required as part of the scope of this project?"

Answer:
 
 We do not envision the collection of field data; however, we do not discourage any particular  approach.

(Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (<span>&nbsp; </span>) are, (<span>&nbsp; </span>) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or
declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(2) (<span>&nbsp; </span>) Have, (<span>&nbsp; </span>) have not, within a three-year period
preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with
obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust

theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false
statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving
stolen property; and</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(3) (<span>&nbsp; </span>) are, (<span>&nbsp; </span>) are not presently indicted for, or
otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission
of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(4) (<span>&nbsp; </span>) Have, (<span>&nbsp; </span>) have not, within a three-year period
preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following
criteria apply:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability
is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the
case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer
is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where
enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(ii) Examples.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of
deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.<span>&nbsp; </span>6212,
which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax
deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax
liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final
tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with
respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. Sec.<span>&nbsp; </span>6320 entitling the
taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the
lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to
sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled
to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior
opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it
is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will
not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial
appeal rights.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement
pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.<span>&nbsp; </span>6159. The

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Incorporate additional information for the Cyber Operations Core Technical Competency Area: Cyber Threat Avoidance ; (2) Changing the FY09 recommended dates for white papers for this topic only; (3) Delete paragraphs found in Section I and Section II that refer specifically to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions.
<p>(1) Challenge Problem Title: Cyber Threat Avoidance</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Cyberspace is a warfighting domain that is customarily viewed as favoring the offense. Most of the time, cyber defenders are relegated to a tactical, reactive engagement with threats. This mode of operation is not only unsustainable as these activities increase, but brings into question the viability of all cyber-dependent missions. Among the most challenging domains of cyberspace is that of the Airborne Network (AN). Airborne Networks (ANs) are three dimensional mobile ad hoc networks formed in the sky. The nodes in ANs may have communication links to ground based control stations, other ANs, as well as satellites. The nodes may move extremely rapidly causing dynamic topological changes to the network. ANs have stringent and very low latency requirements for entering the network as well as for transmitting data packets.</p>
<p>In order to gain control of our cyberspace, we must develop strategic, game changing technologies that tip the balance of favor toward the defense. One set of such technologies can be described as those that enable threat avoidance. Threat avoidance contrasts with traditional approaches to network defense such as perimeter defense, intrusion detection, etc., because in its ideal embodiment, it makes these unnecessary. Avoidance reduces or eliminates the need to fight. In reality, we will require a robust means to detect intrusions, block attacks, and recover from damage, simply due to the fact that we cannot avoid every threat. However, if we adopt the mindset and begin developing technology to avoid threats through various technological means, we can begin to modify the domain to favor the defenders.<br />The information assurance (IA) framework for ANs, like any terrestrial network, includes authentication, authorization, access control, confidentiality, trust management, intrusion detection, and information forensics. The most critical parameter that distinguishes the IA framework for ANs from a terrestrial network is timeliness. The IA designer for ANs almost always has to balance security with the latency that comes with it.</p>
<p>Challenge Problem:</p>
<p>Develop means to modify the Cyberspace domain of the Airborne Network to eliminate vulnerabilities beforehand or make them inaccessible to the adversary. Utilize established anti-tamper and software protection tenets to mitigate vulnerabilities by 1) moving them "out of band," in the sense that they are made technically or physically inaccessible to the adversary; or 2) designing them out completely through systematic design practices. Since the Cyberspace infrastructure, specifically the Airborne Network is a technological domain devised and built by humans, the "laws" that define its behavior can be re-written, and therefore this medium can be modified at any level to favor protective or defensive purposes. Vulnerable protocols, architectures, instruction sets, etc. must be modified, extended, or replaced as necessary to secure critical warfighting systems. In the airborne domain a trust model protocol is required to provide a method to prove the identity of a node without giving away any information regarding a pre-shared secret. The trust model protocol must use less bandwidth, less computational power, and less memory as compared to existing authentication methods. These characteristics make them appealing for devices with resource constrained applications. The most noteworthy benefit of using a trust model protocol is that no hints about the secret are given during the entire authentication process.</p>
<p>Develop "polymorphic" techniques for a dynamic approach for continual and rapid multi-dimensional modification of the cyber domain. These modifications will take place many times per second if necessary, through various protocols such as that described above, and at multiple computer and network layers providing agility in defense so that the attacker loses the advantage of time and attack preparation. Agility in defense includes establishment of early indications &amp; warnings (I&amp;W) mechanisms that detect anomalous activities or entities, rapid analysis of the activity to include attribution and geolocation, anticipation of future behaviors and effects, and real-time provisioning of defensive systems in the most effective way. One approach for avoiding threats in real-time is to present adversaries with an agile "moving target" through the use of evasion tactics to prevent detection and identification in the first place, and escape tactics if evasion fails and a viable threat is confronted. Another approach is to utilize methods to better guarantee the authenticity of each node in the network and continuously verify their credentials through all transactions. Situation Awareness will serve as an input to enable defensive agility in an accurate threat and environmental context.</p>
<p>Relevant Areas of Needed Research:</p>
<p>Mission assurance architectures, agile network architectures, agile computer architectures, threat identification and mitigation, polymorphic systems and networks, cyber indications &amp; warnings. What is the appropriate trust model technical implementation for this type of application? Can a trust model protocol be developed to gain acceptable trust utilizing very little bandwidth, memory and computational power to gain a high level of confidence?</p>
<p>(2) The submission date for this challenge problem only will be 10 April 2009.</p>
<p>(3) The following sentences have been deleted from Sections I and II respectively:</p>
<p>"Additionally, AFRL/RI has an active Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions Program. Hence, research proposals from HBCU/MI maybe funded from special funds that maybe set aside by the II Director." , as well as the following: "There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value. Awards for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions Program set-aside research efforts are constrained by the funding allocated. Individual awards normally will not exceed twelve (12) months and will range from $50K - $100K; with a portion of the research being performed at the Rome Research Site."</p>
<p>All other information remains the same.</p>

Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Best Estimated Quantities are included in the attached RFP.

<DESC>Questions and Answers (Q&A)

Question #1 The proper NAICS code for this offering should be 812332....This is the correct NAICS classification for Industrial Launderers, which include Uniform Rental and Laundry Services as titled on this solicitation.  The SBA Size Standard is $14 Million.

Response Question #1: The NAICS code is changed to #812332 Industrial Launderers.

Question #2 Statement of Work--Paragraph 2.6 states that "No rental uniform shall have a wearing cycle of longer than 18 months."  This statement makes the assumption that the garments won't last beyond 18 months, which is not true...Depending upon the usage and how "hard" a wearer is on the garments, some garments may need replacing BEFORE 18 months, and many should wear well beyond 18 months.  Especially with respect to the Hazard Level 2 garments requested, the industry standard useful life on those garments (due to the Nylon content in them) is twice as long as with 100% cotton, level 1 garments...Many of those garments have a useful life, depending upon usage, of up to 3 years or longer in many instances due to their inherent durability in the Level 2 fabric.   If you pre-determine a garment life of only 18 months for all garments, then you are telling the offerors that they will have to invest double (twice the garments necessary to fulfill the requirement at the outset) during the term of the contract.  Thus, an offeror would have to account for double the investment, and thus, the pricing will reflect the double investment.  Almost all uniform rental solicitations have wording such as this instead:  "Garments in need of replacement due to normal wear and tear will be replaced with new garments during the term of the agreement, on an as needed basis, and in all cases, at the discretion of the CO or end user."  This way only garments that need replacing get replaced, saving both sides the expense of a forced, unnecessary replacement, but still leaving the control of what does and does not get replaced at your discretion.  This is a standard operating procedure in our industry, and as long as you control it, should not be a problem.

Response Question #2: Please delete the last sentence in paragraph 2.6 of the SOW No rental uniform shall have a wearing cycle of longer than eighteen (18) months" and replace with this sentence: Garments in need of replacement due to normal wear and tear will be replaced with new garments during the term of the agreement, on an as needed basis, and in all cases, at the discretion of the Contracting Officers Representative (COR).
Question #3 SOW--2.7 With respect to replacement costs of the uniforms, this paragraph states that garments that are less than 9 months old, the replacement would be 50% of the cost.  This must be a mistake and does not make any sense.....If a new wearer gets all new garments (over $1000 worth for 11 sets of clothes), then leaves after a week or even a few weeks, why wouldn't the replacement cost be 100%.  This type of action would cause us to lose money, which I don't think is the intent of the rule. We have seen many specs which call for a decreasing replacement value based on life of the garment, but in almost all cases, the replacement cost would be due at 100% for the first period (usually up to a year), then graduate down in value each year after that.  Again, this rule seems to base itself on an 18 month useful life, which, as noted in 2) above, is not the industry standard at all.  If this clause remains (much like the one discussed in #2 above), then again, it would be reflected in much higher pricing than is necessary if the replacement costs guidelines were industry standard.

Response Question# 3:Please delete the second, third and fourth sentences in paragraph 2.7 of the SOW "If Plant Division fails to return a uniform and the uniform is less than nine months old, Plant Division shall pay half of the replacement cost of the uniform.  If the uniform is between nine months and fifteen months old, Plant Division shall pay one quarter of the replacement cost of the uniform.  If the uniform is more than fifteen months old, Plant Division shall not be charged for that particular uniform."

Please replace these deleted sentences in paragraph 2.7 of the SOW with - "If Plant Division fails to return a uniform and the uniform is less than one year old, Plant Division shall pay 100% of the replacement cost of the uniform.  If the uniform is more than one year old, Plant Division shall pay a replacement cost for the uniform by applying a decreasing replacement value that is based upon the life of the uniform, as mutually agreed upon between the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) and the Contactor

   Question #4 SOW--3.1.2 With respect to Shirts sizes, stock sizes of up to 3XL is available from all manufacturers, and some (including our supplier) carry up to 4X....but any sizes larger than that would be available, but only as a special custom cut.  I assume prices quoted are for stock sizes and colors available from most any manufacturer....Again, this is standard availability to the industry.
 
Response Question #4: Pleas add the following sentence to paragraph 3.1.2 of the SOW - Prices quoted should be for stock sizes and colors available from most manufacturers.

<DESC><p>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT 0001 IS TO SUBMIT A REVISED STATEMENT OF WORK FOR THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS UPGRADE IN SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION (CIP) AS DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>1.0 Background</p>
<p>The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service's (NESDIS) Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) maintains and operates the Central Environmental Satellite Computer System (CEMSCS) and the Satellite Environmental Processing System (SATEPS) data centers at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland, MD. These separate processing operations are being consolidated into a single, Environmental Satellite Processing Center (ESPC). Many of the data, products, and services provided directly contribute to the issuance of life saving NWS watches and warnings to the public. As such they fall under Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) -63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, i.e., a backup capability needs to be established for critical products and functions should a disaster render the primary OSDPD ESPC inaccessible or inoperable. These systems are currently single points of failure for the nation's environmental satellite data images and critical products used by the NWS and Department of Defense (DOD) as inputs to analyses and forecast models.</p>
<p>The OSDPD CIP project will provide backup systems located at the Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station (WCDAS) and be able to perform all mission critical operations and critical product data processing functions in the event of a catastrophic outage at the NSOF site. A phased implementation approach is planned with the first phase providing a backup for CEMSCS. Subsequent phases will be identified and implemented to include incorporating Metop (CIP Phase 1.5), SATEPS (CIP Phase 2.0), NDE, and other capabilities as needed.</p>
<p>The NESDIS Office of Systems Development (OSD) provides project planning, architecture definition, and project management to the CIP acquisition project. As such, the Ground Systems Division (GSD) has identified and obtained approval for the current CIP phased implementation approach, has provided for the building at Wallops to house the OSDPD Backup Facility (OBF), procured the hardware, software and communications required at the OBF, and is in the process of configuring the equipment for use at the OBF.</p>
<p>This Statement of Work (SOW) describes the activities that the OSD Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Project Office (herein after referred to as "OSD") requires the contractor/vendor (herein after referred to as "vendor") to perform for OSD.</p>
<p>2.0 Scope of Work</p>

<p>3.0 Place of Performance</p>
<p>The equipment purchased under this SOW may be shipped at the NSOF facility in Suitland, MD, at the vendors' off-site office location(s), and at WCDAS as described in the Travel section below (if required).</p>
<p>4.0 Deliverables</p>
<p>Deliverable Name Due<br />CDM600L Digital Satellite L-Band (TX &amp; RX) Modem April 27, 2009</p>
<p>5.0 IT Security Requirements</p>
<p>The C&amp;A requirements of clause 73 do not apply, and that a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>6.0 Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance for this effort shall be: Date of Contract Award Through April 27, 2009.</p>

<SUBJECT>58--MOD 0001 ISSUED TO EXTEND THE PROPOSAL TIME
<SOLNBR>N0017809Q1127
<RESPDATE>032409
<ARCHDATE>04242009
<CONTACT>Stacey Palivoda 540-653-8133 Stacey Palivoda,Voice: 540-653-8133,Fax: 540-653-7088
<DESC>Modification 0001 is being issued to extend the proposal time and to provide further guidance and answer the following questions that have been received.  The revised closing date is 2:00PM ET on 24 March 2009.  The revised anticipated award date is 27 March 2009.Q1.  What are the paint requirements? 
A1.  There is not a Mil-Spec/Standard indicated at this time but paint quality shall be suitable for shipboard application.  If a Mil-Spec/Standard will be used, then please specify it on the quote.  The color should be gray.  
Q2.  RFQ states "Fixed or removable panels are optional for the top, base, and left/right side panels but must be specified in the proposed design."  Question - are all the panels themselves to be quoted as options, or is the "fixed or removable" design the option, which is to be specified in the quote which includes the panels.
A2.  It is optional whether the proposal has fixed or removable panels.  Please specify whether the panels will be fixed or removable.
Q3.  Razorback panels:  RFQ states 1-6 for the tall rack and 1-4 for the small rack. Seeing how the number of panels impact price, which will be a key criteria in contract award, I would assume all those bidding are just going to quote 1. Looking for some clarification. A3.  The RFQ states that 'Razorback/waterfall configuration preferred but not required.' The more removable sub-panels the better.  The more 'razorbacks' with removable sub-panels would be the most desirable.  Furthermore the 'Razorback/waterfall configuration preferred but not required' statement shall be applied to both the 18U and 36U cabinets.
Q4.  The request is showing the racks needing to meet MIL-STD-461, is this meaning the rack must be shielded (RFI/EMI) along with the splash resistant requirement.  Please advise.
A4.   The RFQ indicates that MIL-STD-461 is a 'desirable requirement' and that it 'will be considered in the decision to purchase'.  
Q5.  The request sheet is indicating to supply removable I/O panels 15" - 18" wide.  Since this is a standard 19" EIA cabinet can we supply standard 19" wide panels?  Also, will these panels be painted the same color as the cabinet?  Please advise.
A5.  The RFQ states, for the larger cabinet, "Rear panel shall have 1 to 6 flat removable I/O panels totaling 15"-to-18"W x 18"-to-30"H." and, for the smaller cabinet, "Rear panel shall have 1 to 4 flat removable I/O panels totaling 15"-to-18"W x 9"-to-14"H."  In other words, the rear panel has removable I/O 'sub'-panels.  Furthermore the Razorback/waterfall configuration preferred but not required' statement shall be applied to both the 18U and 36U cabinets.  Cabinets, panels, and sub-panels should be all the same color.
Q.6.    Please clarify the actual quantity being purchased.
A.6.  "NSWCDD will purchase four (4) 19-inch electronic's rack enclosures - two of each, 36U and 18U.  NSWCDD intends to purchase all four (4) rack enclosures from the same vendor."

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) will not issue paper copies of this announcement. The NSWCDD reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  NSWCDD reserves the right to fund all, some, or none of the proposals received under this BAA. NSWCDD provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned. It is the policy of NSWCDD to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and not to disclose their contents. This announcement will remain open for 60 days from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA.  Proposals may be submitted at any time during this period.
Please note:  This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY, NOT A SOLICITATION.    Department of Defense funding for this BAA will be provided in one of the following funding categories:  RDT&E (Research Development Test and Evaluation), 6.1. Basic Research, 6.2, Applied Research or 6.3. Advanced Technology Development   
Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division is interested in receiving proposals/ white papers describing sensor concepts to affordably include a specialized seeker inside a guided 81mm mortar called Flight Controlled Mortar (FCMortar).  The baseline FCMortar design uses GPS for guidance, a multi-option fuze, and has space available in the nose tip for CanyonFinder of approximately the size of an existing 81mm mortar fuze, with expansion allowed for apertures or lenses up to 1 inch in diameter.  Technology developers should anticipate similar operating environments to existing 81mm mortar ammunition fired from the M252 mortar system. During, but not limited to, the terminal phase of flight, the Terminal Seeker shall provide inputs to the Guidance, Navigation, & Control (GNC) system to allow the control system to steer the mortar projectile to targets in-between buildings, to the street level.   Proposals should identify system assumptions: initialization procedures, requirements, and timelines; and whether their technology is a Fire & Forget, Energy Designated, Sensor Fusion, or Other.
Questions should be directed to Andre Lowman, Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5110,(Code CXS11-8) or email to andre.lowman@navy.mil. 
Terminal Seeker Objectives are:	A. Fire & Forget (F&F) sensor systems require no external designation, after launch, to complete the mission.  F&F proposals should describe how the sensor would complete its mission with in-flight input from onboard systems, and the greater value provided versus other technologies.
B. Energy Designated (ED) sensor systems may utilize external systems to illuminate the target/target area in order to facilitate the determination of the proper target location.  ED Proposals should describe the designator technology, and the greater value provided versus other technologies.
C. Sensor Fusion (SF) sensor systems are combinations of multiple sensor technologies, within the seeker, that work in concert to better meet mission requirements.  Sensor Fusion systems can be F&F, ED, or both.  SF proposals should describe how the combination is of greater value than a single sensor technology alone.
D. Sensor proposals that are categorized as other should describe how their technology doesn't fall into the F&F, ED, or SF categories, and how its uniqueness is of greater value than the other categories.
All sensors, regardless of type, should be small, light-weight, low power, and should describe any impact to the aerodynamics of the system as a whole.  Each proposal should also outline the sensor's environmental limitations.  Application and Submission Process for White Papers	All white papers submissions will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 15.207, applicable law, and Department of Defense and Department of Navy regulations. Offerors are expected to appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information.  All white papers received will be maintained for a period not to exceed three years and will be considered as candidate sources for research projects during that period.  Offerors may replace, update, or withdraw white paper submissions at any time.  All white papers submitted for topics will be considered.  Submissions of white papers under this BAA are expected to be unclassified. However, confidential/classified proposals are permitted with prior / advanced approval from the technical point of contact. Offerors are expected to appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information. The NSWCDD, Code CXS11-8 must be notified in writing 5 working days prior to submission of any classified proposals. Every classified proposal must be accompanied by an Unclassified Statement of Work (SOW). Alternatives to the format and content identified below may be appropriate depending on the scope and nature of the proposed effort. All white papers received that indicate interest in a particular research/technology area will be reviewed for potential projects in that area. Please identify the area in which your research and/or technology is to be considered. Awards may be made at any time. Not all proposals deemed selectable will be funded.  The Government reserves the right to award on all, some, or none of the proposals received and to fund all or part of the efforts presented in a proposal.  Multiple awards are possible. Offerors shall identify proposed contract type in their white paper submission.
Proposal Evaluation
White papers will be reviewed and formal technical and cost proposals may be required from sources whose approaches have been selected for further consideration. An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure subsequent contract award.  Formal Cost and Technical Proposals may be required approximately four (4) weeks after notification that NSWCDD has decided to pursue the offeror's approach as identified in their white paper submission.  Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria: (A) Overall scientific, technical, or social-economic merits of the proposal; (B) Potential contributions of the effort to specific Marine Corp missions in target location and acquisition effectiveness and overall reduction in size and weight, as made clear in the proposal; (C) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (D) The qualifications, capabilities! , and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives: (E) Innovativeness in identification of problems and approaches to solutions; and (F) Realism of the proposed cost and availability of funds. 
White papers should be written in MS Word format, photos and illustration should be in either .jpg or .pdf format. The white paper shall be emailed to andre.lowman@navy.mil.  Hard copies submissions are neither required nor desired. 
White papers should be formatted as follows:    		A. Cover Page (one page) - identify offeror by name and address, include point of contact (Office of Sponsored Programs, etc.) with telephone number and email address, include date of submission, indicate that submission is in response to this BAA.   	B. Overview. The white paper submission must include an abstract encompassing technology being used, not to exceed ten type written pages.  C. Costing (one page) - provide representative salary costs (hourly rates). In addition, identify and provide all applicable indirect (facility and administration) rates that would be charged on each project; provide name, address, and point of contact, including telephone number, of applicable government auditor and, Administrative Contracting Officer.   D. Specific Research Area Information  - provide specific capability information applicable to the research area to supplement information provided in the overview; identify/discuss specific human resources expertise, specific facilities or equipment relevant to the research area, offeror's prior participation in related research projects, and any other relevant information. DO NOT submit a specific research proposal unless requested.  Please identify the topic area applicable to your white paper submission.

WHITE PAPER EVALUATION PLAN DEFINITIONS
STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES/DEFICIENCIES - The consistent identification of proposal strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies is very important in the documentation of the evaluation results.  
 A. A proposal strength is an aspect of the proposal, which meets or exceeds a desired or mandatory requirement of the BAA.  B. A proposal weakness is defined as an unattractive, although not unacceptable, aspect of the proposal.  It is a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of less than successful performance.  A significant weakness is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful performance.  
C. A proposal deficiency is defined as an aspect of the proposal, which is an unacceptable response to the specific factor or sub-factor.  A deficiency indicates unacceptability of an aspect of the proposal, which requires revision before award can be made to that offeror.  The presence of several significant weaknesses in the proposal will be considered as a deficiency.   The presence of several deficiencies in major evaluation factors/sub-factors may warrant exclusion of the proposal from the competitive range.

 RISK ASSESSMENT - A risk assessment will be made for each separately evaluated factor and sub-factor.  This Risk Assessment will include a description of the risk areas made apparent in the offeror's proposal.  It will also include the assessment of the impact those risks will have upon the overall program.  Both risk and the offeror's plans for risk mitigation, if provided, will be evaluated.  A Degree of Risk (high, moderate or low) will be assigned for each evaluated factor/sub-factor as well as the overall proposal in accordance with the following:
HIGH RISK   Likely to cause significant serious disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.  Significant doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record, and/or the information contained in the proposal that the offeror can perform the proposed task.  Detailed justification that explains why the Evaluation Committee took this position must be provided.
MODERATE RISK   Could potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance without close contractor oversight.  Although some doubt exists as to the offeror's ability to perform the task, special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring should be able to overcome difficulties.  There is risk associated with the proposal but the offeror has recognized the risk and has proposed specific actions to mitigate the risk.  The contractor's proposed risk mitigation methods are acceptable to the evaluators.
LOW RISK   Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring should be able to overcome any difficulties.  Little doubt exists that the offeror can perform the proposed task.
G.4 TECHNICAL MATURITY - Offerors will evaluate the technical maturity of the proposed control unit technology on a numerical scale from 1 (very low) to 10 (very high).  Notional benchmarks for assessing technical maturity are as follows:
1 - Basic principles observed and reported.2 - Technology concept and/or application formulated.3- Analytical and experimental critical functions and/or characteristic proof of concept.4 - Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.5 - Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.6 - System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.7 - System prototype demonstration in an operational environment.8 - Actual system completed and 'flight qualified' through test and demonstration.9 - Actual system 'flight proven' through successful mission operations.10 - COTS solution ready for production. 

Questions regarding this announcement may be submitted to NSWCDD (Code CXS11-8), 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448, or email to Kelley.fitzsimmons@navy.mil.  This announcement will remain open and white papers will be accepted through 26 March 2009.  Awards may be made at any time after this notification is published, but only those offerors who have submitted white papers will be considered.  Early submissions are encouraged.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Scientific and Engineering Research for Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, and, as such, solicits the participation of all offerors capable of satisfying the Government's needs.  This BAA should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of a resultant contract; the Government is not bound to make any awards under this announcement.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) on 02/24/2009 for closing agent services for single family properties owned by HUD in the state of Arkansas.  HUD intends to award one contract to cover the state of Arkansas. The primary objective is to perform closings on HUD-owned properties as quickly as possible, within 50 miles of the subject property.   A purchaser is normally allowed 30-60 calendar days to close a transaction, however, sometimes HUD may offer special incentive programs to homebuyers to close in a shorter period of time, such as 15 days after contract signing.  The contractor is expected to coordinate with the Management and Marketing contractor (M&M) to accomplish the closings within the allotted timeframes unless an extension is necessary due to circumstances outside of the contractors control.   The contract will be performance-based with incentives and disincentives.  The contract duration will be for one year with three one-year options.  This is a total small business set-aside.  More detailed information concerning the work requirements will be provided in the solicitation.  The solicitation is now available for downloading from the Federal Business Opportunity website.  The NAICS Code is 541191 with a size standard of $7 million.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be made available.  Telephone and email requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  Small business concerns need to respond with a written proposal by 12:00 noon on 04/03/2009.  Answers are provided in this amendment in response to written questions received from prospective offerors on this solicitation.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory intends to award to Valon Technology, LLC, on other than full and open competitive basis for the assembly, fabrication, testing and delivery of a Modular UHF Transponder and Power Amplifier Assembly. The UHF Transponder must do a non-processing conversion of signals in the 250-270 MHz range and convert them to signals in the 290-310 MHz range without distortion. The power amplifier stage must accept two transponder inputs, combining with them to produce an overall gain of 100 dB and a power output of 2W. Both of the units must be lightweight and have an input and output impedances of 50 ohms and be electronically shielded (enclosed) to reduce EMI. The delivery will be required within 10 weeks of contract award. Additional specifications will appear in the RFQ. Sole source is based on Duplication of ongoing effort for advanced fabrication of a proven Modular Transponder Design to Valon Technology, LLC. (Microsoft IE Required). The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Mark S. Levi, Energy Program Manager, Phone 415.522.3374, Fax 415.522.3311, Email mark.levi@gsa.gov
<DESC>RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS:

Q1:  The existing Trane chiller nameplate requires a maximum of 200-amp
overcurrent protection, however it is currently fed from the MCC with
the original 225-amp breaker. Are we going to be expected to bring that
chiller up to code also? Do we want to A. reduce the size of breaker, or
B. install a fused disconnect with 200-amp fuses? 
A:  We will require the contractor to evaluate and make recommendation to GSA as to whether to replace this breaker.  An amendment will be posted requiring this. We will not require the contractor to do this work unless a subsequent price adjustment is negotiated.

Q2:  Will we be expected to have an electrical engineer review and sign off
on this project?
A:  Yes, final design documents need to be stamped by a PE for each applicable discipline.

Q3:  Are we expected to replace or reuse the existing heat tape on the
chilled water piping?
A:  Heat tape on the existing piping being reworked can be reused to the
extent possible or replaced with new.  The intent is to provide a
properly operating system when complete. 

Q4:  In the specs I noticed we are to install 2 new control valves one for each
chiller. Do you have a spec for these or is the controls contractor going to
provide the control valves for us to install?
A:  The new chiller specifications already provides a "manual" butterfly valve
reference.  GSA will contract separately for a control contractor to provide a pair of matched
actuators, for both chillers, that will operate with their output scheme for
any butterfly valve configuration, this in lieu of having the mechanical
contractor provide a new control valve for both the new and exiting
chillers.

Q5:  Is this a taxable project?
A:  GSA as a federal agency is tax exempt.  However this only applies to taxes levied directly against GSA.  Taxes which a contractor must pay as part of its costs may be included in the bid price.

Q6:  Are bid/performance bonds required for this project?
A:  Yes.  A bid bond for 20% of the amount bid must be submitted with proposals.  This will be returned to unsuccessful offerors at time of award, and to the successful offeror on receipt of payment and performance bonds (which must be for 100% of contract price).

Q7:   Do you request just a standard proposal with the job scope for the Bid Submittal?  If so, do you want included with the proposal equipment specifications (i.e. performance, dimensional, weight, etc)
A:  Look at "Instruction to Offerors" starting on page 11 of the statement of work (near the end of the solicitation document, following the standard clauses).  This itemizes exactly what is required.

Also, if this is the case, will they both be released on or about March 15 as stated on FBO?<BR><BR>ANSWER 7: YES and YES<BR><BR>Question 8: Will funding advancements be given to the small business that is selected to participate on the subject contract? <BR><BR>ANSWER 8:  NO <BR><BR>Question 9: Now that INSCOM is planning on splitting the requirement into two separate procurements, one covering the three set-aside Requirements Categories and the other covering the two full and open competition Requirements Categories, is it still the intent to treat each Requirements Category as a multiple award contract? Specifically, for the Technology Management and Intelligence Operations Support procurement, will bidders be expected to submit a single proposal covering both areas or will each area be treated as a separate contract?<BR><BR>ANSWER 9:  YES AND YES.<BR><BR>Question 10: Some of our qualifications and past performance information can only be adequately described at a classified level.  Will classified proposals be allowed? <BR><BR>ANSWER 10:  YES<BR>        <BR>Question 11: How long or when is the release of the RFP? <BR><BR>ANSWER 11:  TBD<BR><BR>Question 12: Is there a ceiling cap NTE on each requirement, for example, and amount for each under I/O and IT/IA? <BR><BR>ANSWER 12:  TOTAL CEILING FOR OMNIBUS3<BR>        <BR>Question 13: How will the Target allocated dollar amount on the Omnibus III  will be divided into the 5 procurements?

<DESC><p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a solicitation within the next thirty (30) days for a Warrior Wellness Program to improve the Special Operations Wounded Warrior recovery outcome by early introduction of casualty mentors and providing awareness regarding motivating activities available that boost their confidence and self esteem to better compete for wounded warrior friendly employment opportunities developed through community outreach and employment network development.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation announcement only. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement is currently available. Requests for the same will be disregarded.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: A solicitation 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business is being considered by the Government. However, no formal acquisition strategy decision has been made at this time.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance of the program would begin upon contract award in the forth quarter of FY 2009 and run for a twelve month period. It is envisioned that a contract would be established at time of initial award allowing four (4) additional option periods in the contract. The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of all options would be from time of contract award through five (5) years.<br /><br />Any resulting solicitation will call for a Contractor to design, develop, and implement a Warrior Wellness Program addressing the following:</p>
<p>Mentorship Program: Develop confidence in hospitalized, but stable casualties and their families by increasing recuperation process awareness and hope in the future through long-term positive relationships with mentors of similar injuries.</p>
<p>Wellness: Increase the wounded warrior's, families', and hospital staff's awareness of existing quality of life programs through distribution of information and by collaborating with medical treatment facility therapy centers.</p>
<p>Community Outreach: Educate community leaders, businesses, and civic organizations where casualties transition on specific interests and needs of returning wounded warriors to establish a solid foundation for casualty's reintegration into the community.</p>
<p>Resource Networks: Develop a community resource network to capitalize on the success of the mentorship, wellness, and community outreach programs. The Contractor shall also provide access to employment opportunities and community resources further enhancing the special operations wounded warrior's recovery outcome.</p>
<p>Operational Health Advanced Training Program: Provide a program to improve the physical and mental abilities of the wounded warriors returning to active duty with personalized military/tactical performance training in order to give them additional tools to succeed within the military environment.</p>
<p>Advocacy: Educate wounded warriors on available benefits/resources, and interact with Government agencies on their behalf in order to optimize their benefits.</p>
<p>The overall performance objectives include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Severely injured casualties and families verbalize a greater understanding of the recovery "way-ahead" and demonstrate improved recovery rate due to mentor support.</p>
<p>b. Greater casualty involvement in outside activities that have been facilitated through Warrior Wellness Program.</p>
<p>c. A recognized decrease in unemployment rate of casualties leaving military service.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the ability to provide support identified at various locations within the United States as directed by the Government. However, it is anticipated that the primary place of performance will be at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington D.C. The secondary place of performance is anticipated to be Brooke Army Medical Center located at Fort Sam Houston, TX.</p>
<p>Potential sources must possess an active Facility Clearance (FCL) or be eligible to obtain an FCL at the SECRET level.</p>
<p>This procurement is 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business. <br />Questions concerning this pre-solicitation announcement may be directed to Contracting Officer Dr Joseph R Daum, email daumj@socom.mil phone 813-282-8795 ext.6110.</p>
