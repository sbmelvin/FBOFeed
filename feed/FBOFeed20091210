<DESC>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technologies that will enable the integration of several disparate command and control display elements (CCDE) into a single CCDE.  The Air Force will use this information to make informed decisions about an acquisition strategy for this project.  The intent is NOT to settle on a particular technology or product at this time, but rather to assess the capabilities available in the marketplace today and their costs, identify the pros and cons associated with implementing a certain type of solution, and to receive feedback on requirements and architecture views that have been developed for this effort.  There are no definitive plans to procure an actual solution at this time.

<a href="mailto:cheryl_flanagan@blm.gov">Flanagan, Cheryl T</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Division of Resource Services, National Operations Center, Denver, Colorado, has a requirement for services to conduct rapid ecoregional assessments on public lands located within the States of Arizona, Alaska, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, Wyoming, and Utah over the next several years.  Regions assessed may cross State boundaries.  The BLM intends to award multiple IDIQ contracts for these assessments services.  Individual assessments will be contracted for as task orders and competed among the firms who have basic IDIQ contracts with the BLM for these services.  Each task order will be completed in less than 18 months.  Each task order will be for a firm-fixed-price and utilize a performance-based statement of work.
At a minimum, these assessments, issued as task orders, will provide information and analysis necessary to determine the status of the following three categories of conservation values: 1) native species, 2) terrestrial ecosystems, and 3) aquatic ecosystems.  These assessments will also determine the affect of the following four change agents: 1) climate change, 2) wildland fire, 3) invasive species, and 4) development in the form of renewable energy, conventional energy, and urbanization upon these conservation values.  Rapid ecoregional services will include such items as 1) assessment of resource status, and quantification of risk from current and potential exposure to change agents; 2) collection and compilation of existing data; 3) geospatial analysis, modeling, and data management; 4) report preparation and meeting facilitation; and 5) stakeholder and cooperator engagement.  The assessments will show the results in a spatially explicit format (maps) using geographic information systems (GIS) data.  For some change agents, forecasts of future landscape and species change will be required.  Individual task orders may include work for preassessments, assessments, data management, and information technology (IT) services.  The GIS hardware and software will be located at the BLM National Operations Center in Denver and at least some contract staff will need to be available locally.
The BLM intends to award multiple Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  Specific statements of work will be competed among the holders of the IDIQ contracts and awarded as task orders.  One of these multiple IDIQ contracts is reserved for small businesses and will be competed only among small businesses.  The other multiple IDIQ contracts are being competed full and open, and all entities with an active DUNS number registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system may compete for those IDIQ contracts.  It is expected that seven or fewer IDIQ contracts will be awarded.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7 Million.
The period of performance for the IDIQ contracts is one year with four option years from the date of contract award.  It is estimated that each IDIQ contract will have a minimum total order amount of $100,000 and a maximum total order amount of $10 Million.
This service is not considered to be commercial.  The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued through this website on or about January 11, 2010 with responses due on or about February 11, 2010.  Interested parties should download a copy of the RFP from this website and provide a written response by the due date and time indicated on the solicitation.  Responses shall be delivered in a paper format by U. S. mail or delivery service at the address given.  Email or FAX responses will not be accepted.
Some of the statements of work to be awarded as task orders will utilize funds provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act).  Unique provisions required for implementing the Recovery Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency requirements will be included in each IDIQ contract.  Receipt of the contract by the successful contractor will be contingent upon that contractor meeting the requirements in Section 1512 of the Recovery Act. 
Questions may be emailed to Cheryl T. Flanagan, Contracting Officer, at Cheryl_Flanagan@blm.gov (with an underscore mark between the first and last names).

<DESC>The Defense Distribution Center has a requirement for software maintenance for program changes and systems development support required for the Computer Assisted Transportation Terminal (CATT) and associated interface software in operation at the Defense Distribution Kuwait South West Asia (DDKS) and the CENTCO theatre in accordance with the attached SOW for SP33000-9316-1006. The resultant award will be a Labor-Hour Contract.  The labor rates will be firm-fixed, the labor hours wlll be estimated, and the total contract amount to be Ceiling Price.  

The period of performance is from 01 January 2010 through 30 September 2010.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541511; the Business Size Standard is $25,000,000.

The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which the Defense Distribution Center New Cumberland, PA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) and FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  The Government intends to award a Labor-Hour Contract resulting from this action using FAR Part 13 to the sole service provider General Dynamics Information Technology, Incorporated.

General Dynamics Information Technology, Incorporated is the only source that can provide this support due to the proprietary nature of the systems and software  which were developed by General Dynamics Information Technology, Incorporated for the CATT and CENTCO threatre at DDKS.  Since the software in use is declared proprietary, no other vendor could meet the objectives without gaining access to the source listing (code).

Any attempt to develop an alternate source to provide this support, if possible, would result in a substantial cost to the Government. Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to provide the required support by 4:00 PM EDT, 28, December 2009 to Linda Hirsch, Acquisition Operations, DDC J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone: 717-770-4092, FAX: 717-770-7591, or e-mail: linda.hirsch@dla.mil for consideration by the agency.  In order to be considered for an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation reqirements by either calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

If no affirmative responses are received by 4:00 PM EDT, 28 December 2009 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated and awarded to General Dynamics Information Technology, Incorporated.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to acquire approximately 40 Doppler Very High Frequency Omni-directional Range (DVOR) Electronic Kits, Part Number 068955-0001.
This market survey announces the FAA's intent to award a single source contract for DVOR Electronic Kits to Thales ATM, Inc., 23501 West 84th Street, Shawnee, KS 66227.  
The original design of the 2nd Gen VOR is over 30 years old. Thales (formerly known as Wilcox and Air Sys, ATM) is the only producer of the 2nd Gen VORs approved for use in the National Air Space (NAS).  Thales originally produced DVOR Kits under the 2nd Gen contract.  Thales retains the proprietary rights to the DVOR Electronic Kit design.  Presently there are numerous VORs that have restrictions due to encroachment of the VOR siting criteria caused by unplanned natural and manmade obstacles.    These restrictions are having a serious impact on enroute routing and arrival and departure procedures.  These DVOR Kits will eliminate most of these restrictions.  
This announcement is not a request for proposals. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this announcement nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding hereto. Questions are comments must be received by Greg Rugila at greg.rugila@faa.gov not later than January 15, 2010.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract with one base year and four option years to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Museum of the North.  The Service requires the Museum to identify vascular plant specimens, create a herbarium database containing taxonomic classification, mount and label specimens and forward information to the National Wildlife Refuge.
The University of Alaska Fairbanks, Museum of the North has led all the major taxonomics studies of plants for the Kodiak Archipelago over the past 20 years. This Museum is the most familiar with the area of 2009 study operation based on research it has conducted within and adjacent to the refuge since the early 1990's. Furthermore, the Service maintains a challenge cost share agreement that requires partners to deposit their specimens and information to the Museum of the North. Contracting with another source would jeopardize the continuity and integrity of this project due to a deficiency in site-specific experience and knowledge required to meaningfully describe and interpret project results.
Work description:The Museum will perform the following services:1. Identify species of vascular plant specimens collected on the Kodiak NWR in 2009; input specimen data into herbarium database; mount & label herbarium specimens; and email a copy of the database containing taxonomic classification and collection details for the approximately 450 plant specimens collected by the refuge in 2009.  2. Evaluate University of Alaska's herbarium records and the botanical literature to determine which new species were collected and documented to occur in the Kodiak Archipelago and in Kodiak NWR since 1975.  Compile determinations and provide synonyms, in cases where taxonomy changed, input into spreadsheet format, email results to the refuge.  Using these same resources, similarly annotated files will also be created listing the entire documented flora from both the Kodiak NWR and the entire Kodiak Archipelago.  3. Generate and deliver a report of results from the 2009 plant survey.  Report to include summary; background information (brief description of objectives, study sites, methods); results and discussion-primarily regarding notable floristic finds; and bibliography.     This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for providing security and law enforcement services for federal facilities. <br />The ICE Office of Acquisition (OAQ) plans to offer a requirement for a Computer Aided Dispatch Information System (CADIS) in support of the FPS Law Enforcement Mission.<br />To eliminate current functionality gaps and to address new law enforcement requirements a new system is needed that will automate core FPS law enforcement business processes and will result in a more standardized, integrated, and efficient national information technology solution for FPS. The system must provide a level of scalability and compatibility with other DHS, ICE, and FPS systems and shall always be in compliance with emerging DHS enterprise architecture. Further, the system must reflect the seamless integration of the following three functional components. <br />1) Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System for personnel dispatching in response to incidents.<br />2) Record Management System (RMS) to collect, share, and report incident information based on National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) standards. A system to conduct efficient call center management, which includes automated data collection, calls routing, viewing call history, etc.<br />3) Geographic Information System (GIS) to provide location information to assess dangerous sites, improving routing, vehicle tracking and to display other relevant neighborhood information.
<p>Furthermore, the proposed CADIS must replace the current Daily Operations Log (DOL) and Web Records Management System (WebRMS). <br />CADIS shall have the capability to collect, modify, store, retrieve, and process record management and geographic information data via a report management function and a record management system. CADIS will improve FPS Officer Safety, as the current manual processes will be automated; reducing the chances of critical errors by removing the extensive liability that currently exists with the dispatchers. Additionally, CADIS will provide intelligent resources in reporting information that is needed to make knowledgeable business decisions and aid in criminal analysis, helping FPS' efforts in providing preventative security measures. <br />Specifically, the system shall:<br />&bull; Be fully National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) compliant<br />&bull; Implement a system availability of 99.999 percent when measured on a 24-hour per day, seven day a week basis for 365 days. Processor, disk storage, and power supply redundancy may be required in order to achieve the desired availability and protection of information. The system shall be configured such that operating a training component and/or running reports will not affect system response time.<br />&bull; Interface with external applications and data sources.<br />&bull; Have the ability to push the client application via the DHS network to desktops and Mobile Computing Devices (MCD) via the internal network.<br />&bull; Allow a user the ability to access the application, download appropriate information and forms relating to incidents, and submit the necessary information without re-keying information. <br />&bull; Allow the capability to be directly expandable by adding hardware and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) modules. <br />&bull; Include a feature for backup, archival and recovery capability without taking CADIS out of service and with minimal impact on dispatch operations. <br />&bull; Provide the capability for users to work offline in the event of connectivity failures, and the capability to continue to work off-line in the event the failure occurs in the middle of a session without any data loss, and to upload saved offline data when connectivity is re-established.<br />&bull; Contain data exporting capabilities. CADIS must have the capability to export data in industry standard database formats to facilitate providing data to other databases controlled by DHS and/or other government entities. <br />&bull; Be able to generate standard automated forms and templates to be used by all regions; such as incident report, spot report, etc.<br />&bull; Contain a wide variety of reports and statistical information for analysis and management reporting and/or reporting requirements in real time. <br />&bull; Allow ad-hoc, dynamically generated reports such that code modifications are not required for each new report.</p>
<p>It is the intent of FPS to adapt to the current industry best practices as it relates to the FPS operating procedures and the operating environment of CADIS. Implementing CADIS will enable key FPS stakeholders the opportunity to assess current operating procedures against any productivity gains that can be realized through the introduction of automation. Consequently, neither a blanket "technology driving the process," nor a "process driving the technology" approach will be embraced, but a balanced approach that seriously evaluates the cost/benefit trade-off in moving from current to new operating procedures.</p>
<p>A full and open competition is anticipated with a request for proposals expected to be issued on or about December 25th with proposals due approximately 30 days later.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO ACCESS SYSTEMS, INC. FOR THE RESASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.  In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act  (ARRA) of 2009, Pub. Law 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of intent to issue a modification to an existing Delivery Order for the purchase of 290 additional Millions of Instructions Per Second (MIPS).  The Delivery Order was issued against a previously competed contract, TIRNO-07-D-00004.  This contract was awarded to Access Systems, Inc., a small business.  This purchase will upgrade our existing software licenses and maintenance through September 30, 2010.  This will be a firm-fixed price modification that has an anticipated value of $370,500.

The additional MIPS are needed to support new workloads to the IRS mainframe environment.  Mission critical tax applications will be affected by the changes implemented by the ARRA resulting in increased workload volumes and changes that will require additional processing resources.  The increased workloads include processing new Business Master File tax forms and handling increased volumes of queries to support customer interactions with the IRS for other tax application systems such as Corporate File Online.  This acquisition will provide the software licenses and maintenance for the additional processor capacity needed to process these workloads.

No other sources for these items currently exists.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Furnish all supervision, labor, materials, and equipment necessary to construct a new two-story, 4,800 square meter Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) Plant Expansion for the IRS Enterprise Computing Center (ECC) in Kearneysville, WV.  The proposed site is directly adjacent to the Warehouse portion of the IRS ECC in Kearneysville, WV.  Upon completion of construction of the MEP Plant Expansion, the existing MEP Plant operations in the lower level of the Warehouse building will be migrated to the new MEP plant expansion.  The existing MEP space will be abandoned.  The project will involve the phased relocation of the majority of the existing mechanical plant equipment, including replacement boilers, and the replacement of the majority of the existing electrical plant equipment, including a new static UPS system.  The new plant shall be constructed without interruptions or significant reductions of operational redundancy to the existing operations.  	

The project work includes all work necessary for new construction and renovation and includes, but is not limited to work in the following areas: Deep Foundations, Concrete, Structural Steel, Metal Decking, Fireproofing, Masonry, Pre-cast Concrete, Roofing, Drywall, Doors, Windows, Paint, Elevators, HVAC, Plumbing, Fire Protection, Electrical Power, Lighting, Building Automation System, Landscaping and other associated work.  

This is a metric project as drawings and specifications are prepared utilizing metric units.  The approximate duration of the contract is thirty (30) months.  The estimated cost range of this project is over ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00), will be a firm fixed price type contract, and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  The successful offeror will be required to utilize GSAs computer software ePM system (Electronic Project Management) to communicate with the entire team regarding the status of contract administration issues.

A source selection/best value method will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement.  The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked.  GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being more important than price.  

This is an advisory multi-step procurement process.  Consequently the acquisition process shall consist of five phases: 1) receipt and evaluation of Step 1 technical proposals; 2) provide notification to each firm with regards to their technical rating; 3) after providing firms with the 100% construction documents (any firm who submitted a technical proposal under Step 1 will not be precluded at this stage), receipt of Step 2 technical proposals and price proposals; 4) develop a competitive range and conduct interviews; 5) if necessary, upon completion of negotiations, request, receipt and evaluation of final price revisions.   

Initially, offerors will submit their Step 1 technical proposals, consisting of the following technical factors: Past Performance and Key Personnel Qualifications/Organizational Chart.  It should be noted that the evaluation factors are listed in decreasing order of importance.  After receiving their technical rating, offerors may submit their price proposals and their Step 2 technical proposals, consisting of the following technical factors: Project Management Plan, Subcontractors Past Performance, Project Schedule, Construction Alternatives and Subcontracting Methodology.  It should be noted that the evaluation factors are listed in decreasing order of importance.  Any firm who submitted a Step 1 technical proposal will not be precluded from submitting a Step 2 proposal.  However, a contractor must submit a proposal under Step 1 in order to submit a proposal under Step 2. Next, those offerors included in the competitive range will be interviewed.  The technical proposals will be reviewed and evaluated prior to and separately from the review of the price proposals.  GSA intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.  GSA reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

The solicitation will be available on or about 10/15/09.  Interested parties may download their own copy of these documents.  These documents will be in .pdf format and may be accessed on a World Wide Web (WWW) server at http://www.fbo.gov .  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this website for the release of any amendments and to download their own copy of any amendments.  This site provides instructions for downloading the amendment file(s).  

Licensed general contractors are invited to respond to this Stage 1 Pre-Solicitation Notice by submitting one (1) original and seven (7) copies of the required technical and price information. The submission should be in an 8-1/2" x 11" bound or 3 ring binder format and should be organized to correspond with the evaluation factors. 

Prior to award of this contract to a large business, an acceptable subcontracting plan will be required in accordance with FAR Part 19, which demonstrates a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum small business goals for all subcontracted work: small business concerns (Goal 37%), hubzone small business concerns (Goal 3%), small disadvantaged business concerns (Goal 6%), women-owned small business concerns (Goal 5%), veteran-owned small business concerns (Goal 5%) and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns (3%).  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with            FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  This procurement is being solicited through full and open competition procedures under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  The NAICS CODE is 236220.  This synopsis constitutes the synopsis of the Pre-Invitation Notice.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The Jacksonville District, US Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) Only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements to Water and Air Research, Inc, (WAR) 6821 S.W. Archer Road, Gainesville, FL 32608, to obtain environmental sampling and analysis services related to the US Navys Mayport NS dredging project. The 2010 103 evaluation of the Mayport Naval Station (NS) new construction dredging project is a retest of potential dredged material (DM) from Mayport NS turning basin that is proposed for disposal in the Jacksonville Ocean Disposal Dredged Material Disposal Site (ODMDS).  The original testing was completed in 2009 by Water and Air Research and forwarded to USEPA Region 4 for concurrence.  EPA gave partial concurrence for ocean disposal of most of the dredged material but has required additional sampling and analysis in order to provide a final concurrence for ocean disposal of materials from the Mayport Turning Basin. Due the critical importance of continuity in testing and tight schedules involved this work requires a contractor familiar with Mayport NS sediment sampling requirements with experience in sampling and analysis of NE Florida marine sediments.  This service will be delivered to the Jacksonville District, USACOE.  FSC Code is H291, NAICS Code is 541380, Size standard is $11 Million.<BR><BR>The sole source determination based on WAR being the only eligible company that can deliver the desired service without resulting in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<BR><BR>This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may express their interest;  accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than December 18, 2009 C.O.B. Responses should be sent to jesse.lugo@usace.army.mil or faxed to Jesse Lugo at (904) 232-2748. Telephone responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>General Information<BR><BR>Northwest Region will initiate the standardization process for Disinfectant Surface Cleaners for its seven Army, Navy, and Air Force medical facilities in Washington and Alaska.  The product line consists of various sizes of disinfectant wipes and sprays. This is new product line initiative for the Region. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize products or product lines obtaining the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price based on volume pricing discounts utilizing a best value determination process. Standardized products will be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. <BR><BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the LSA-West region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Region include but are not limited to:<BR>Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award. For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil. <BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is 02/10.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>The Point of Contact is Rosa Crumpton, phone: 253-968-0898, and e-mail rosa.crumpton@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR> B. Products & Performance Required <BR>The NorthWest Region is seeking Disinfectant Surface Cleaner Products which at a minimum include the product lines below. Within the region, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $156,100. This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period.

Instructions to Vendors <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to rosa.crumpton@amedd.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D. Evaluation Criteria <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the NorthWest Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Source Selection Procedures:<BR><BR>Pre-Source Selection Procedures:<BR><BR>1. The TRBO has used market research to confirm the availability of product groups which the Northwest Region DSL has selected for standardization. <BR>2. The MTFs in the Region volunteer and Clinical Product Team (CPT) members are selected for participation in the standardization process.  The 4 MTFs that will be participating in the clinical evaluation of this standardization initiative are Madigan Army Medical Center, WA; Naval Hospital Oak Harbor, WA; Bassett Army Medical Center, AK; and Fairchild Air Force Base Hospital, WA.<BR>3. The Clinical Product Team (CPT) develops, validates, and approves the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria and the evaluation process to be used.<BR>4. The CPT determined and approved that both literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation in a non-clinical table top setting. Requested samples will only include high-volume products. <BR>5. The Northwest Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) develops and submits the APP and Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) Request for Quotes through the DSL for review by Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP). <BR><BR>Source Selection Procedure:<BR><BR>1. This selection procedure is a one-step source selection process. The Northwest Region will post the RFQ to the FBO for a period of 21 calendar days. A letter (email) notice to the current vendors identified in the market share analysis above will be sent the same day the FBO is posted. The closing date and time will be the same, for the RFQ and for the email notification. <BR>2. Vendors will provide an initial response to the FBO posted RFQ by emailing their interest in participating in the standardization process to the point of contact (POC) listed on the FBO. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial response regarding their interest in participating in the standardization process, actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of close of business (COB) 4:00 pm (PST) Pacific Standard Time on the date listed for closing on the FBO RFQ, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. <BR>3. The TRBO will request responses to the technical/company criteria, no charge literature, no charge sample set, and best value pricing from the vendor in a one-step source selection process. The one-step source selection process provides vendors with 30 calendar days to respond to the TRBO with the completed spreadsheet for both the Technical/Company criteria and the Vendors best value price quote; and deliver the no charge literature and no charge samples to the MTFs participating in the clinical evaluation process. The Technical/Company Criteria and Best Value Price Quote worksheets will be sent to the vendor via email and will include a due date. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions and criteria listed in the FBO announcement. Vendors that do not respond to the technical/company criteria will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. Literature and samples must be received by the participating MTFs by COB 4:00 PM PST, 30 days after the date of request to supply samples. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment.  The samples to be provided are as follows: Quantity: 2 re-closable tubs of largest size wipe (containing a minimum of 40 wipes) and/or 2 bottles 12-32 ounce disinfectant spray to each participating facility.<BR>4. Vendors that do not meet the deadline to deliver the literature and samples by the deadline or fail to send literature and samples to the MTFs will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. Vendors best value pricing will be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Northwest Region. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submission/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off the Vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northwest Region). Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. However, the Region reserves the right to request revised quotes, if determined necessary. The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. Vendors that fail to submit price quotes will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing by e-mail at the conclusion of the process.<BR>5. The TRBO team will compile the technical/company criteria responses and the results will be forwarded to the CPT for review. The technical and company criteria are weighted equally. The CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services, 2) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional more specific definition of technical acceptability. The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. <BR>6. The CPT members will evaluate each vendors literature and sample set against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last up to 30 days. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert type scale with a 1-5 scoring range. The scale descriptors are: One (1) = Strongly Disagree; Two (2) = Disagree; Three (3) = Neutral; Four (4) = Agree; and Five (5) = Strongly Agree. The CPT will send the completed evaluations to the TRBO for data entry and analysis and the results will be forwarded to the TPRB for review. The CPT has set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative  at or near 3.1  depending on the location of any break (or gap) in vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.1, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. <BR>7. The vendors will forward price quotes to the TRBO, the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis, and the results will be forwarded to the TPRB for review. The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is included as a reporting metric), and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items. Cost avoidance is used as a reporting metric, not as an element of the decision. The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the DAPA prices will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the offer.<BR>8. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. The Northwest Region TPRB will review the data to support a selection of the best value, lower overall cost quote. The TPRB will vote on a standardized vendor for Disinfectant Surface Cleaners.  Each MTF on the TPRB is allotted one vote for the selection of the standardized vendor.  The votes are tallied and the vendor with the majority of votes is the selected standardized vendor.  A multiple award is possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region.<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT developed, validated, and approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:<BR><BR>1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Disinfectant Surface Cleaners.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: Disinfectant Surface Cleaner Wipes in tubs or canisters (various sizes including extra large) and/or Disinfectant Surface Cleaner-Spray bottle 12-32 ounces. Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.   <BR>2. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (e.g. catalog) and product literature in response to this RFQ (Literature must contain efficacy studies).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified.<BR>3. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Disinfectant wipes and sprays product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified) <BR>4. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current Prime Vendor for the Northwest Region, currently Cardinal, for distribution in the Northwest Region.  Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.<BR>5. Vendors must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offer a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified.<BR>6. Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the Northwest region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. <BR>7. Vendors must provide education/training (in person), regarding their products to the staff.<BR>8. Vendors must provide posters in regard to education about the products, including Do NOT use on skin signs.<BR>9. Vendors must include product Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) in response to this RFQ.   <BR>10. In response to this RFQ, vendors must provide a sample of typical individual item packaging information (label) which includes instructions for use, product lot number, expiration date, precautionary use/safety information, disposal instructions, and EPA registration as a hospital disinfectant with label claims of kill times regarding tuberculocidal activity. If product contains bleach, labeling must carry EPA/FDA registration. <BR>11. Vendors must show evidence that spray bottles have both stream & spray delivery in response to this RFQ.<BR>12. Vendor product offerings must include brackets and wall mounts for disinfectant wipes.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT developed, validated, and approved the following equally weighted clinical/performance criteria.  <BR><BR>1. Clinician Safety-Contents of each product are easily identified. <BR>a. Allows staff to quickly select products and save time.<BR>b. Products will be observed during the evaluation.<BR>2. Staff Compliance/Staff-Patient Comfort  Disinfectant surface cleaners scent/odor is not offensive during dispensing and/or use.<BR>a. Offensive scent/odor may cause allergic/sensitivity response in staff and/or patients.<BR>b. Products will be observed via smell during the evaluation.<BR>3. OSHA Requirement/Patient Safety- Disinfectant surface cleaners cleans surface effectively.<BR>a. Soiled and/or contaminated surface need to be thoroughly cleaned to eliminate or minimize occupational exposure to blood borne pathogens.<BR>b. Products will be observed during the evaluation.<BR>4. Wipe/Spray remains moist for the minimum recommended kill time (stated on label).<BR>a. The wipes should hold enough fluid for the surface to remain wet for the time required to disinfect. <BR>b. Products will be observed and felt during the evaluation. <BR>5. Patient Safety- Disposable wipes are strong enough to prevent tearing during use. ----Wipes only<BR>a. Save time. Tearing or shredding wipe may cause incomplete contact and affect kill times.<BR>b. Products will be observed during the evaluation.<BR>6. Spray includes spray and stream delivery. Sprays only<BR>a. The sprays need both spray and stream for a variety of deliveries for a variety of applications.<BR>b. Products will be observed during the evaluation.<BR><BR>Post-Source Selection Procedures:  <BR><BR>1. The TRBO prepares the Decision Document for signature by the DSL and submits a package including the clinicians comments to DSCP for review and approval.  <BR>2. The RIA is initiated by the TRBO.  Vendors will be contacted and the TRBO will notify the TPRB, DSCP, PVM, and regional MTFs.<BR>3. If requested by a vendor, the TRBO will informally share information on the selection.  The Region will notify DSCP immediately in instances in which a vendor expresses substantial dissatisfaction with the evaluation.<BR>4. The selected vendor is given 15 calendar days to upload their RIA pricing to DSCP.<BR>5. The TRBO follows-up with the vendor and DSCP to insure pricing is loaded in the UDR. <BR>6. The TRBO assists the Regional MTFs in conversion implementation and reviews their compliance.<BR>7. The TRBO markets the clinically preferred product selection and cost avoidance benefits.<BR><BR><BR>Pricing Analysis:  <BR><BR>1. Vendors will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the LSA West Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (PST), thirty (30) calendar days or as described after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements. <BR><BR>2. The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  <BR>a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);<BR>b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   <BR>c. Impact of Unmatched Lines [i.e., unmatched lines require the Region to either substitute a less than optimal item or pay DAPA or possibly open market prices to obtain the item]; and<BR>d. Consideration of SKUs by each vendor intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>3. Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR><BR>4. Vendors will forward pricing to the Lead TRBO, and the Lead TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the individual Region TPRB.  Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<BR><BR>5. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<BR><BR>6. The Regions TPRB reviews the data to support a selection of the best-value, lowest-overall-cost quote. The Regions TPRB votes for the best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative for a single vendor selection.  The DSL will review the basis for the selection and approves the selection.<BR><BR><BR>Rules of Engagement: <BR><BR>a. Standardization Evaluations will be conducted in areas designated by the TRBO.<BR>b. Clinicians will use an evaluation tool, which will be collected by the TRBO.<BR>c. CPT members can have no invested personal interest in the outcome in a standardization effort. <BR>d. CPT members will be familiar with the specific guidelines for accepting gifts and incentive type items from vendors.  Any violations of the guidelines will be reported to the appropriate officials.  <BR>e. The TRBO will perform statistical analysis of data obtained from the evaluations.<BR>f. Vendors will deliver products to designated location and specified time as agreed upon by the vendors and the TRBO.<BR>g. Vendors presence will not be required during this evaluation.<BR>h. When participating in a standardization effort, vendors must contact the TRBO prior to contacting any clinical personnel in reference to the product being considered for standardization. <BR>i. Additional education or training on the selected products will be at the vendors expense. <BR>j. All evaluation methods will have a start and stop date set by the CPT that will be strictly enforced.  <BR>k. The government is not responsible for cost of sample items, shipping of these items, or any costs associated with the clinical evaluations.<BR>l. Only products selected by the CPT will be reviewed during an evaluation.  All other products presented during the evaluation will be rejected.<BR>m. Unless specifically requested by the TRBO, NO COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD SPEAK TO ANY HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBER OR TPRB MEMBER REGARDING PRICE OR PRICE-RELATED FACTORS.<BR>Failure to comply with any of the rules of engagement described above may result in disqualification of your company from further consideration.  Please do not hesitate to contact our Clinical Analyst at 253-968-0898 for questions.<BR><BR>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">USUHS has determined that Applied Biosystems is the only reasonably available source to meet the government&rsquo;s requirement. As the manufacturer of these systems, Applied Biosystems is the only company that has the specialized and technical knowledge, as well as the necessary tolls, manpower and repair parts, to maintain this equipment. Further, these systems are highly specialized in design and application requiring software and firmware updates and system component upgrades that are proprietary to the vendor. All major component parts and assemblies, including circuit electronics, are specialized in design, whereby obtaining these parts from alternate sources as a generic item is not possible and not in the best interest of the government. </span></p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought posting for market research purposes only. This is not a Request For Quote. The Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, CA is seeking vendors capable of providing the 412 Test Wing (TW) at Edwards AFB access to Boeing Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Block 30/35 and 40/45 high fidelity Hardware in the Loop Aircraft Simulators, F-15 and F-18 High Fidelity Labs (HFL), J-UCAV, F-22, Apache, DDX surface vehicles, B-2, and B-52 simulators integrated into a common Network Centric Warfare (NCW) simulated environment.
<p>For the past several years, the 412 TW has been developing its TDL test capability to meet customer requirements. Recently, System Program Offices have been directed per Defense Acquisition Guidebook Chapter 7 to make their systems comply with the Net Ready Key Performance Parameter (KPP) as defined in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 6212.01D. To fully test against the Net Ready KPP, a test infrastructure has to be put in place that will stimulate a System Under Test (SUT) in a realistic communications and data link environment. To properly stimulate the SUT it must be placed in an environment that realistically simulates the environment on the battlefield. It is critical that our testing methodology follows the paradigm of "Test Like We Fight." The United States Air Force (USAF) Transformation Flight Plan 2004 has mandated this testing paradigm. To create this environment in a cost effective manner, hardware in the loop and high fidelity simulators must be linked with live airborne assets in a simulated battlespace environment. Since there is no single facility that maintains simulators for all of the different platforms required for testing communications in a battlefield environment, simulators must be linked together via Data Acquisition and Transmission System (DATS) and/or the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN) and displayed in a common environment to produce the environment needed for test.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide access via the network to AWACS 30/35 and 40/45 hardware in the loop high fidelity simulators, F-15 and F-18 HFL, J-UCAV, F-22, Apache, DDX surface vehicles, B-2, and B-52 simulators, for use in NCW interoperability testing. Each simulator shall be manned by the contractor during each test. Contractor shall send and receive TDL messages real-time per requirements in a defined NCW test scenario. The contractor shall provide real-time "ownship" data. Simulation assets shall be integrated into a NCW battlespace environment provided by the contractor. Depending on the scenario, these simulators may also be required to receive and process threat data in a Distributive Interactive Simulations Protocol Data Unit (DIS PDU) format from the AFFTC Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS).</p>
<p>If explicitly called out in a task order, the contractor shall provide an NCW Battlespace Environment capable of displaying a terrain lay down from anywhere in the world. If not called out in a task order, no development effort shall be accomplished to provide an NCW Battlespace environment. A NCW Battlespace Environment is a real and simulated environment where message communication across TDL exists. This environment shall be capable of integrating simulated or live airborne aircraft into the environment via a DIS interface or Joint Range Extension Application Protocol Version C (JREAP-C) TDL Interface according to MIL-STD-3011 (30 Sep 02 or latest revision). The environment shall be capable of depicting both red and blue force data in real-time. The NCW Battlespace Environment shall be capable of operating at a maximum of a Top Secret SCI SAR Level. The environment shall be able to receive threat data from the AFFTC DIADS via a DIS PDU in real-time. The environment shall be capable of graphically depicting any asset in the environment with its graphically representative image. The environment shall accurately depict an asset's position in the environment as well as its real-time three dimensional movement. The environment shall be capable of displaying real-time TDL message traffic from and to all TDL capable entities within the environment. The environment shall be capable of displaying "ownship" data real-time from any aircraft simulator within the battlespace. The environment shall be capable for storing all real-time TDL and "ownship" data with its associated Inter Range Instrumentation Group Version B (IRIG B) time tag. The environment shall contain a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based data retrieval capability to access data sets according to metadata that includes as a minimum the following: Flight Number, Test Card Number, Time Range, Simulators Required, Type(s) of Data (TDL Message Data, Simulator "Ownship" Data). The environment shall contain a GUI based data analysis capability that can display and print in both tabular and graphical form and allow application of necessary data analysis toolsets. The data analysis capability shall be able to store on electronic media, in a format compatible with AFFTC data formats such as Microsoft Excel with comma separated variable format, for any data set retrieved.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the network connectivity required to link their simulators and NCW Battlespace Environment to the AFFTC DATS and/or the DREN as defined in the task order. The contractor shall ensure that all applicable network security paperwork from the appropriate security agency is completed and approved before connecting their network with any government network(s) as specified per task order. The security level shall be at a maximum of a Top SCI SAR Level.</p>
<p>The contractor shall store and keep crypto keys for network access. The contractor shall provide manning to operate its simulators during NCW test events. The contractor operators shall operate the system according to defined mission scenarios. Contractor representatives knowledgeable of their system capabilities and limitations shall participate in Technical Interchange Meeting teleconferences during the test planning phase to assist in the definition of test scenarios for a particular test. Contractor operators shall participate in Mission Pre-Briefs the day before a mission to ensure that there is an understanding of the test and receive any changes to the test mission. Contractor shall participate in Mission Post-Brief within one working day after completion of test to review test methodology and results.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide engineering and technical support assisting in test planning, test conduct, and data analysis. The level of support will vary by task order. At a minimum, it will involve confirming the defined scenario can be executed with the designated assets and that the contractor operators understand how and when to execute the defined procedures. The contractor shall provide technical support required to establish and maintain the network linkage between the contractor's simulation assets and the AFFTC DATS and/or DREN networks. The contractor shall provide engineering and technical support required to troubleshoot data problems with simulators, TDL messages, and "ownship" data. The contractor shall provide technical support required to set-up, operate, and troubleshoot a common simulated battle environment.</p>
<p>The government shall provide at least a 4 week notice prior to a requested test event. The contractor shall provide a proposed schedule per task order to be agreed upon by government and contractor.</p>
<p>The following Contract Data Requirement List (CDRL) shall be identified as required per task order. Status reports (CDRL A001), Funds and Manhour Expenditure Report (A002), Data Accession List (A003) shall be provided to the 775 TS/ENV, and copied to the government personnel identified by the 775 TS/ENV. The financial report shall provide detailed reporting of expenditures. Contractor format is acceptable. Test/Inspection Report (A004) will also be required as identified on individual task orders.</p>
<p>The contractor shall travel as identified per individual task order as required to support test related meetings. Most meetings will be held via telecon. The contractor shall coordinate access to Edwards AFB facilities with the government Program Manager. All foreign nationals must be identified prior to contract award.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotes.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.
Background
US Customs and Border Protections (CBPs) mission is to facilitate the legitimate flow of people and cargo into and out of this country while denying entry to persons or cargo that would be dangerous to this country or which for any of a number of reasons may be denied entry.  CBP identifies persons who would pose a danger were they allowed entry in the United States (e.g., the individual was on the terrorist watch list, have a medical condition that would pose a threat to the US population, or have prohibited agricultural materials etc.) and collects tariffs and duties on imported goods.  CBP is a front-line agency in the war on terrorism and collects more revenue than any US agency other than the Internal Revenue Service. 
In the course of its operations, CBP receives vast amounts of trade secret and vendor proprietary information, including manifests listing the quantities and value of all goods entering the US; Personally Identifiable Information (PII) related to persons entering or leaving the country, as well as vast quantities of national security information at a variety of levels of classification, Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) Information, and a variety of types of Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) information.  CBP is required to protect proprietary information by the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. 1905), intellectual property by the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Disclosure Regulations contained in 19 CFR 133.21 and 133.25, PII by the The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C.  552a, and SBU data by a range of laws and regulations.
CBP operates a wide range of automated information system including legacy mainframe systems, modernized applications, and various standalone applications.  These systems are written in a variety of Operating Systems including Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX, and zOS,  languages ranging from Cobol to Java and C# and use DBMS ranging from DataComDB to Oracle, DB2, and SQL Server.   Currently, CBP is migrating away from both the mainframe and DataComDB.  CBP is also moving to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) not just for communicating with external parties, but also as the basis for its modernized applications.  Microsoft Office is the primary suite of office software used throughout CBP and Microsoft SharePoint is to be the primary vehicle for sharing of documents and files, although there are still a large number of legacy files stored on Novell Servers.  CBP is adopting the DHS mandated single sign-on solution which is based on Microsoft Active Directory and Kerberos, although much of the user authentication is currently performed using CA TopSecret on the mainframe.
Statement of the Problem
Although CBP only shares information with duly authorized and cleared personnel with a need to know, secure information sharing is an essential part of CBP's operation.  The CBP and DHS policy is "to share by rule and withhold by exception."  CBP Is currently investigating the state of the art in Information Rights Management (IRM) and Digital Rights Management (DRM) tools and technologies that would allow the flow of sensitive information to those authorized to see it and with a need to know while limiting the unauthorized dissemination of such information to those without clearances, or without a need to know.  Currently CBP controls the flow of sensitive information through the use of document markings for particularly sensitive documents, a number of policies related to securing and dissemination of sensitive information, and training courses related to the dissemination of sensitive information.  This approach is becoming increasingly cumbersome and CBP is looking for a solution that minimizes the difficulties encountered by users with a legitimate need for information while both preventing the inappropriate disclosure of information and identifying persons attempting to inappropriately disclose such information.
CBP is specifically looking for products to support this effort, products which CBP may bring into a lab to pilot their use and evaluate their usefulness.  Since CBP has some of the nation's largest, most highly skilled systems integrators under contract, CBP is not looking for firms offering to perform requirements analyses and then to identify product(s) that they will integrate into our environment.  
Responding to this RFI
Information provided in response to this RFI must be submitted no later than 30 calendar days from the date of posting, in the form of a white paper.  Responses should be limited to not more than ten (10) single spaced pages.  Please note that the collection of this data does not obligate the U.S. Government to the incorporation of the solicited comments in any future procurement action nor does it obligate the Government to the procurement of any services or products related to this RFI.

4.	Information Rights Management and / or Digital Rights Management  What is the respondents approach to both the identification, management, enforcement, and auditing of the information or digital rights? 
5.	Products Being Described  Please describe any specific products that are included as part of this solution.  Please describe which vendors products are required to implement the solution.  Please describe how the proposed approach is dependent upon / integrates with products already in the CBP environment.  If the proposed approach is dependent upon CBP use of specific products how would the vendor support CBP users that do not have access to, or who do not use, those products?
6.	Product Integration  Please describe how the products specified above integrate into the CBP environment and will be used in the CBP environment.
7.	Document Protection  Please describe the range and type of information, documents, and files for which the product provides protection and the manner and degree to which protection is provided.
8.	Vendor Experience  Please describe the vendors experience implementing the solution described above.  In addition to the vendors experience implementing the solution described above, please describe what results that customers have obtained using that solution. 
9.	Training  What training does the respondent provide that would be available to CBP personnel in both the use and operation of the product?  Describe vendor recommendations for how to accomplish training of large numbers of CBP personnel?
10.	Other  What other information and ideas does the private sector offer for pursuing this initiative?  What other factors related to this effort should CBP be aware of (e.g., issues with approaches other than the one the respondent has proposed)?

This material is required to support ongoing clinical trials with multiple previously submitted Investigational New Drug (IND) applications with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Any change in the source of the material would require new analytical assays to be developed, new formulations to be produced, new IND's to be filed with the FDA, and would have a negative impact on the evaluation of data already generated from the ongoing trials.</p>
<p>There are 3 ongoing NIH protocols using this substance, each with a separate IND describing the use and character of this sterile product. The Keyhole Limpet is a type of sea urchin and the Hemocyanin is a constituent of the sea urchin's blood which has been extracted in a certain way.</p>
<p>There are differences in the activity of different colonies of Limpets and so, it is important for the integrity of the studies to get the KLH from the same source. The FDA is aware of the importance of this control factor in the ongoing protocols.</p>
<p>The Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin MUST MEET the following requirements;</p>
<p>1. The product shall have an extensive safety record and meet all FDA guidelines for use in clinical trials. The FDA currently requires pathogen testing of KLH for the viruses, Hepatitis A, Norwalk and Rotavirus and the bacterium Vibrio cholera. Vendor must supply data that the KLH is free of Hepatitis A, Norwalk and Rotavirus and Vibrio. The testing shall be included on the Certificate of Analysis for every lot of KLH provided.<br />2. Because of the processes in place for harvesting and purifying the KLH which prohibit denaturation, the KLH which is currently being used in the protocols is more potent than that of other products available. The denatured subunit of KLH is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 400-450,000 daltons while the native form of KLH is a dodecamer which consists of 20 subunits of KLH with a molecular weight of 8 - 9,000,000 daltons. In the natural Hemocyanin product at least 50% of the KLH exists as a dodecamer and the remainder can be found as dodecamer aggregates. <br />3. Our current KLH is purified as a native molecule and meets the molecular weight 8 - 9,000,000 standards. None of the KLH is detectable as being degraded or existing in its subunit form. This native form renders the KLH more potent immunologically than products containing degraded KLH.</p>
<p><br />4. The formulation of the currently used KLH product already includes a solution in a physiological buffer eliminating some waste associated with reconstitution of the lyophilized KLH since some denatured KLH is rendered insoluble by lyophilization.<br />5. The material being used is harvested in a humane manner from Limpets contained on premises whereas other manufacturers use "wild" Limpets which are returned to the ocean and therefore unable to demonstrate that the Limpets survive the exsanguinations process. Specifically, for these ongoing protocols the crude material is only harvested from Limpets that are identified and tagged. This Hemocyanin is removed in a non-lethal manner from Limpets and they are then returned to the water. Records are kept indicating when and how each Limpet has been harvested and the fate of each Limpet after it is returned to the water. After sufficient recovery times, these Limpets can be reused for harvesting more Hemocyanin. The forms of KLH (KLH1 and KLH 2 present in approximately a 60 to 40 ratio in the native state) are monitored to assure that the animals have recovered and are producing the native form of the molecule. This provides a large, renewable source of the crude material.</p>
<p>It is critical to the integrity of the protocols and the ongoing research that the KLH be from the current supply source previously used in the ongoing trials.</p>
<p>Offerors must provide descriptive literature or other materials that demonstrates their ability to meet the forgoing requirements. Firms with the capability of providing the required supplies listed above are required to submit a capability statement to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502(b) whether or not this procurement will be set aside for any of the programs described above. The intended procurement will be classified under the North American Industrial Classification (NAIC) code 325411 with a size standard of 750 employees. All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business. Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (a) capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills, and capability to fulfill the Governments requirements above.</p>
<p>The capability statement should not exceed 15 pages and be in sufficient detail so that the Government can determine the experience of your firm to provide the requirements above. Capability statement must be received at the address identified in the synopsis prior to the close of business (4:30 PM local time at designated location) on December 24, 2009. <br />This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any cost incurred in responding to this market survey and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, or will the Government pay for any solicitations.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research (DESPR) is interested in identifying organizations with requisite qualifications to conduct a study on Teen passenger influences on teenage driving performance. This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify small business organizations with requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein. Based on capability statements received in response to this Sources Sought Announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside or through full and open competition. All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice. Small business organizations must have their size status certified by the small business administration.  The NAICS code is 541720 with a size standard of 500 employees.

BACKGROUND
Crash rates are highly elevated among teenage drivers at licensure and decline rapidly for a period of months and more slowly over a period of many years (Mayhew et al., 2003).  Crash risks are particularly high under certain conditions, which include in the presence of teen passengers, at night, under the influence of alcohol, and while using electronic devices (e.g., Williams, 2003; Lee et al., 2006).  The effect of teen passengers has been demonstrated with respect to risky driving (e.g., Simons-Morton et al., 2005) and crash risks (e.g., Chen & Baker, 2000), but it is not understood the extent to which this may be due to social influence or distraction or both (e.g., Regan & Mitsopoulos, 2003; Simons-Morton et al., 2005).  It may be that teenage male passengers exert overt pressure on teenage drivers to drive faster and follow more closely.  Alternatively, the effect of teenage passengers may be due to the perceptions of the driver about social norms regarding risk taking.  Also, teenage passengers may distract teenage drivers.  Teen passenger presence may interact with driver characteristics, driver in-vehicle task engagement, and driving conditions and purposes.  Moreover, some subgroups of young drivers may be especially susceptible to passenger effects, for example, males, those with a propensity for sensation seeking, and those who are highly susceptible to social influence or who are highly distractible.  To date most research on these topics has been observational and not experimental.  To better understand the nature of passenger effects on driving risk experimental research is needed.  This research also provides an opportunity to examine basic social science questions about social influences.  In particular, the research seeks to determine the relative importance of perceived social norms and peer influence on teenage driving performance.
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
The research involves the following essential activities: (1) objective assessment of driving performance in a simulator or instrumented (usually with accelerometer, GPS, lane tracker, and often with cameras), vehicle on test or open road; (2) assess variability in driving performance within normal samples of licensed teenage drivers under variable driving conditions; (3) conduct pilot work; (4) calculate sample size and power based on pilot work; (5) utilize randomized research designs; (6) recruit subjects and obtain informed consent; (6) obtain Institutional Review Board approval for ethical research; and (7) rapidly provide preliminary analyses of data. 
Capability statements submitted in response to this notice will be evaluated according to the following criteria: (1) evidence of access to and availability of appropriate equipment and facilities for the research; this may include vehicle instrumentation, a driving simulator, and/or test track; (2) understanding of the research aims and activities; (3) ability to develop, implement, and evaluate measures of driving performance; (4) access to and capacity for recruiting novice teenage drivers; (5) experience with randomized trial study designs, including counter-balanced designs; and (6) ability and experience providing efficient preliminary analyses of driving performance data. 

Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications (1) Experience: an outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineers and technical personnel who may be assigned as principal investigator and/or project officer: (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration.  A statement regarding industrial security clearance.  Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they possess the capabilities described above and wish to respond should submit one electronic version of their capability statements via email to pishionerij@mail.nih.gov by 4:00 PM EST on December 19, 2009. See http://www.sba.gov/size/ for information on what is a small business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates the number of employees.. Capability statements must identify the business status of the organization and should be limited to no more than five (5) pages, excluding an Appendix for resumes. Resumes may be included in an Appendix which does not count in the five (5) total page limit. The Appendix, which may only include resumes, is limited to five (5) pages. NO COLLECT CALLS OR FACSIMILES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<RESPDATE>121509
<ARCHDATE>12162009
<CONTACT>Chiara A. McDowell, Email chiara.mcdowell@gsa.gov
<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Federal System Integration Management (FEDSIM) intent to extend the period of performance under contract GS00T08AJC0009, with Darlington, Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of ITT Corporation, 2325 Charleston Regional Parkway, Charleston, SC 29492 utilizing the procedures of FAR Part 12. 

This action is required to extend day-to-day operational capacity as well as a 24/7 response capacity services for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) due to a receipt of protest against the follow-on competitive award (GST0009AJ0015). As a result of the protest, a stay of performance is in place on the current award until GAO resolves the protest.

The day to day IT and Communications support is critical because it is a cornerstone and an enabling facet of OFDAs ability to respond immediately and robustly to disasters around the world, thus allowing USAID to successfully represent the U.S. Government during times of need. Disaster assistance, as provided through USAID/OFDA, is a key component of the U.S. foreign policy agenda.   Any gaps in the provision of this ICT support would effectively shut down USAID/OFDAs ability to perform both disaster responses and to conduct its on-going operations, thus creating ripple effects around the world.  OFDAs Information and Communications Technology (ICT) support is the essential foundation through which USAID/OFDA is able to respond on behalf of the U.S. Government, not only for disasters but for the continuation of daily operations such as programming funds to on-going disaster situations around the world. It is also the structure through which all communications occur both in and between Washington and OFDAs worldwide staff and counterparts. This includes the following mission critical components: twenty-four hour, seven day a week (24/7) network and user support; field communications equipment and technical officer support (deployed during a disaster response); all end user application deployment, development and maintenance; coordination and compliance with all USAID IT and security policies; and all necessary warehousing, lifecycle management and logistics support for OFDAs IT and communications equipment used for disaster response

Due to the protest and the on-going disaster responses, the government requires the continued involvement of the current contractor and its staff for the anticipated recurring need for these day to day and disaster response services.  The existing contract expires December 31, 2009 and it is the governments intent to modify the existing contract to extend the period of performance, using one-month options, from January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010.  The extension will be performed under the same terms and conditions as the existing contract.  The modification will be executed consistent with the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(2) and implemented by FAR 6.302-2, unusual and compelling urgency. Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements would result in serious injury (including financial), if this contract action is not executed by December 31, 2009.  The actions proposed within this announcement are justified. The government will support the proposed actions by written justification and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.

Interested persons may identify their challenge to this sole source modification response by submitting capability statements that demonstrates the contractors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the government. The statement shall include business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - Providing Assistance in the Environmental Review of Federal Actions at the Northeast Regional Office (NERO) Sandy Hook, New Jersey Field Office
<p>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-5, the Government posts this notice FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. This opportunity is available to Integrated Statistics, Inc., 16 Sumner Street, Woods Hole, MA 02543-1439 under indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract EA133F-08-CQ-0031 against GSA Federal Supply Schedule Contract GS-10F-0395N. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition will award a Time-and Materials (T&amp;M) Task Order against the existing contract for Endangered Species Act Review of Federal Actions.</p>
<p>In 2008, EA133F-08-CQ-0031 was competed and established in accordance with FAR part 8. A single IDIQ award was made to Integrated Statistics, Inc. with an ordering period of five (5) years.</p>
<p>SERVICE DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this task order is to provide support services for the Habitat Conservation Division, Northeast Region, National Marine Fisheries (NMFS) at the Sandy Hook Field Office at 74 James Magruder Rd. Highlands, NJ 07732. The Contractor will provide assistance to the Government in review of federal actions pursuant to essential fish habitat (EFH) provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) as well as the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Economic Stimulus) contains significant funding intended to create jobs. The intent is to quickly disperse these funds into the economy to support "shovel ready" projects. There will be strong pressure to complete any necessary permitting and environmental analysis in order to initiate work and generate jobs as quickly as possible. NERO does not have the resources to provide environmental review of all the federal actions that may impact habitat within the region. The Contractor will primarily provide support in the area of document preparation and presentation.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: R-2009-AY-00471
<p>Notice Type: Notice of Intent to Sole Source and Sources Sought</p>
<p>This notice is being publicized in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101 requiring the Contracting Officer to disseminate information on proposed contract actions expected to exceed $25,000. Further in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, it is the intent of the Housing and Urban Development agency (HUD) to award a one year contract to Electronic Data Systems (EDS) for software support services for the Single Family Acquired Asset Management System (SAMS). The support services will be contracted through the vendor owning the proprietary financial management system software package (INCASE tools)</p>
<p>Potential sources may submit resumes or personnel information plus information specific to their company including name, point of contact, size of business, and company profile. In addition, the potential source should include any pertinent information on contracts that have been performed by the company, similar in size and complexity to this effort, working knowledge of Government Property Asset Management system, Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 and Section 255 of the National Housing Act, and the Insurance Accounting Collection System (IACS). The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of the Chief Information Officer, Washington, DC, is seeking sources to support HUD's core Property Asset Management System (SAMS) of which HUD does not control the source code.</p>
<p>INCASE is proprietary software owned by EDS. The technical support services being sought requires a contractor to: 1) analyze client SAMS application, 2) troubleshoot and provide online (INCASE) and reporting (NOMAD) changes to support department and regulatory requirements, 3) perform operational support, 4) provide secondary cycle support, 5) develop design documents and customize SAMS software to support user requirements, 6) provide SAMS software maintenance support to existing EDS source code and develop formal software release with notes and documentation, 7) conduct unit and system testing for all custom SAMS software releases for validation and verification quality assurance, 8) integrate SAMS baseline upgrades into the HUD environment and, 9) provide support for SAMS off-line batch processing.</p>
<p>The potential source must have specialized experience with HUD's SAMS INCASE software, COBOL programming, NOMAD, VSAM, DB2 and client-server user interface.</p>
<p>EDS was provisionally determined to be the sole source for this award because EDS developed, maintains, controls and claims to own all the proprietary rights to the underlying source code that operates this system.</p>
<p>As a result EDS at this time is the only responsible source to provide the necessary technology and experience to provide these services.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a response describing your capabilities which HUD will consider. Any response must describe how your firm intends to operate the Single Family Acquired Asset Management System without access to the underlying source code.</p>

<DESC>Under a Blanket Sole Source Justification, the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is placing advertisements, as described below, in Ebony and Jet Magazines (through Johnson Publishing Company).  And DOT hopes to place future advertisements of the same nature, in some or all of the targeted publications listed below, in order to disseminate information concerning the Bonding Assistance Reimbursable Fee Program (BAP), which is intended to benefit Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) that are performing work under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).  However, any publication or any business or any organization OTHER THAN the targeted ones listed below, which believes that it is capable of broadly and reliably reaching the target audience of DBEs through the publication of such advertisements concerning BAP, shall e-mail a Statement of Qualifications to James Mowery, at james.mowery@dot.gov, and to Loni Chinn at loni.chinn@dot.gov, not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Time, December 26, 2009.   Details and background are given below.

DOT established the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) in accordance with Public Law 95-507, an amendment to the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.  OSDBU administers the provisions of Title 49, of the United States Code, Section 332, the Minority Resource Center (MRC), which has authority to establish a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Bonding Assistance Program.  The MRC also includes the duties of advocacy, outreach, and financial services on behalf of small and disadvantaged businesses.  

On August 28, 2009, OSDBU launched the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 Bonding Assistance Reimbursable Fee Program (DBE ARRA BAP) to help DBEs to acquire and perform on ARRA-related transportation infrastructure contracts.  In order to fully service the public, it is imperative that the communities this program is intended to serve are made aware of the opportunity to be reimbursed for fees and premiums paid to obtain bonds on qualified ARRA projects.

To this end, OSDBU intends to purchase targeted advertisements in publications directed towards OSDBUs customers in the DBE community.  OSDBU has identified the leading outlets for each of its customer bases and would place advertisements highlighting the DBE ARRA BAP as well as other resources within OSDBU for DBEs.  Each customer base has publications that specifically address the needs and concerns of its readership.  OSDBU would choose where to advertise based on a publications reputation, circulation, and audience.

Targeted publications include (but are not necessarily limited to):

     ~ Ebony Magazine
     ~Enterprising Women Magazine
     ~ Hispanic Business Journal
     ~Jet Magazine
     ~Minority Business Entrepreneur
     ~New From Indian Country
     ~Vetrepreneur Magazine

Nevertheless, any entity OTHER THAN those listed immediately above, which believes that it is capable of broadly and reliably reaching the target audience of DBEs through the publication of  advertisements concerning BAP, shall e-mail a Statement of Qualifications to James Mowery, at james.mowery@dot.gov, and to loni.chinn@dot.gov, not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Time, December 26, 2009.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>A Sole Source Intent is being issued under W9124R-10-T-1006. The Directorate of Contracting Yuma, Mission Installation Contracting Command, Enterprise and Installation (E&I) Operations, Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, (USAYPG) intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract on a sole source basis with Nokia Siemens Networks, 6000 Connection Dr. Irving, TX 75039. This training allows additional personnel to be trained on the Nokia equipment and to expand our currently limited understanding of the Nokia equipment. Nokia certified  instructors have exclusive access to proprietary information about Nokia gear; therefore, they are uniquely qualified to provide expert level training for the Nokia equipment. Training must be completed very rapidly (within weeks) in order to provide required information to units in the field. USAYPG needs to have trained people ready to participate in the field using Nokia equipment. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334220 with a standard size of 750 employees. This action is solicited as unrestricted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If you feel that your firm possesses the ability to provide these requirements, then you must respond by demonstrating your firms technical capability to meet these requirements by 16 December 2009, 8:00AM MST to facsimile (928) 328-6849.

<p>YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUTE DAILY TO THE PERSONNEL SECURITY BRANCH OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, DC</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>OPM has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on prospective ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees. The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information. Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures. ATF will provide these regulations to the Contractor.</p>
<p>ATF realizes there is a need to secure the services of persons possessing certain degrees of expertise in the processing of background investigations, including planning, scoping, assigning and reviewing. To that end, ATF has a need for "In-House Special Investigators," hereinafter referred to as contractors. ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators. Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations. Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.</p>
<p>Contract investigators who are under contract with ATF shall be known as "Special Investigators" and carry credentials authorizing them to perform such background investigations as the Assistant Director may authorize. Contractors may also be assigned to assist with other official ATF investigations.</p>
<p>Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them. Such tasks might include planning assignments, scoping investigations, assigning investigations, reviewing Reports of Investigation (ROI), auditing and adjudicating investigations, completing invoices for payment for the investigation and working on special projects as directed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) and/or Branch Chief. Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.</p>
<p>Contractors' duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability. <br />Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested. Contractors will be paid at the rate of $56.00 per hour. Hours authorized and worked in excess of 40 hours per week will be paid at the rate of $84.00; the need for additional work hours must be agreed upon and have prior approval from the COTR and/or Branch Chief.</p>
<p>Standard In House Contractors:<br />Contractors shall ensure their availability to process needed work in a timely manner. A minimum of 32 hours, four days a week is required. Contractors are responsible for providing adequate office coverage with their respective team; to include holiday and high vacation/travel months. Failure to meet necessary availability may result in termination of the contract.</p>
<p>On-Call In House Contractors:<br />The ATF may have a need to hire on-call contractors. If investigative work and/or an increase in priority investigations create a backlog, contractors would be required to work on an as needed basis; two or three days a week, as determined by the ATF. On-call contractors will be contacted by the ATF when their services are required. Once the necessary work has been performed, contractors will be excused from their assignment as directed by the ATF. On-call contractors must adhere to the same standards and codes of conduct as Standard In House Contractors.</p>
<p>In compliance with ATF's specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked. Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractor's invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services. This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations. Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract. Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.</p>
<p>Contractors are responsible for safeguarding information. Background investigation information is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 and, unless classified, is considered Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) (also or formerly known as Sensitive but Unclassified information). CUI must not be transmitted via unsecured email or Internet, or disclosed to unauthorized parties. Contractors must never furnish or divulge CUI contained in an investigation. Each contractor must make every reasonable effort to protect data associated with a background investigation. Data, notes, copies of testimonies, copies of ROIs, etc., are the sole property of ATF and must be safeguarded against unlawful disclosure.</p>
<p>Each contractor shall execute a MOU, attesting to his or her understanding of this section, which, upon execution, will become a permanent part of this contract. Contractors will have access to ATF's computer network and are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year. Contractors must also complete the following forms: ATF P 7500.1 (Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users), ATF F 2030.1 (Personnel Authenticator Locator), ATF F 1710.5 (Request for Media ID), and Social Engineering Certification.</p>
<p>Identification media, ATF-provided software, and all other Government property must be surrendered when requested by the PSB.</p>
<p>Each contractor must be able to obtain and maintain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and receive a Top Secret clearance. This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the PSB, and be performed under such standards as the PSB may establish. A favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF information, information technology systems, and unescorted access to facilities. Failure to have a background investigation favorably adjudicated SSBI or receive a Top Secret clearance constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor. ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.</p>
<p>Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.</p>
<p>Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. The contractor is responsible for making changes to his/her own information. Any changes to the contractor's name, address, telephone number, company name, tax identification number, or financial institution information must be made by the contractor in the CCR. The CCR is used to process electronic payment deposits. It is vital contractors keep their registration current. In addition, contractors must notify the PSB and the ATF Financial Management Division of any changes so the proper updates can be made to all systems.</p>
<p>Each contractor, when working in the PSB, must carry themselves in a manner that reflects positively on ATF. To that end, contractors, when on duty, should present themselves in a professional manner, be neatly groomed, and appropriately attired. Complaints of inappropriate conduct or performance will be investigated, and if substantiated, may result in the contract being terminated.</p>
<p>Contractors must exhibit professional qualities during all periods of performance and absolute integrity is required and expected. Contractors must be polite and professional in both conduct and appearance.</p>
<p>Contractors should never use ATF credentials for investigating any matter not assigned to them by ATF, PSB or for any personal gain. Contractors must not allow their credentials to be photocopied or taken from their possession. Lost or stolen credentials should be reported to the PSB immediately, as well as the local police department.</p>
<p>ATF intends to issue vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2014. The solicitation will close December 16, 2009 at 4 p.m. EST. All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors. A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably. Because ATF's needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation add new contractors to the pool.</p>
<p>Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA. A BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminate the need for more complex acquisition methods. There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity. All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor. Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative. The BPA and the contractor's responsibilities thereunder are subject changes in Federal law, regulation and policy, which may include, but are not limited to, procedural changes related to the use of government equipment, security procedures and investigative priorities. Modifications may be sent to vendors via mail or electronic mail. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.</p>
<p>The following clauses are incorporated in full force: FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror - Commercial Items (Oct. 00) and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference) Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items; A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications- can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far. The Contractor may request a copy from SIAdministration@atf.gov. Offeror shall provide a statement proving they have read and understand the term and Conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.</p>
<p>EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.</p>
<p>Capability of the Vendor.</p>
<p>ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendor's acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate). All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration. These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply. Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability. Vendors rated as "passed" will be awarded points for past performance and experience. Vendors with an overall score of at least 68 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores. At least 56 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance and 12 must come from Vendor Capabilities.</p>
<p>A. Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance (80 Points): Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing. A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended. ATF will evaluate each vendor's experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency. ATF may assess the vendor's communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations. ATF may contact some of the vendor's customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction. In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF. ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.<br />(56 points minimum).</p>
<p>B. Capabilities (20 Points): Capabilities are the vendor's ability to adhere to agency and program requirements. (12 points minimum).</p>
<p>C. Acceptability: ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a "pass" or "fail" basis. A vendor's offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor's assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any). If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable. Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.</p>

<DESC>The requirement is for maintenance of  General Electric medical systems such that the product performs to the original specifications, as well as monitoring of the systems in order to predict failures, and take corrective action to prevent such failures, software maintenance to include periodic updates as well as event based updates necessary to protect the security of the networks.  This equipment includes Magnetic Resonance Imaging Systems (MRI), radiographic/fluoroscopic systems, radiographic systems, computed tomography scanners (CT), nuclear medicine scanners (SPECT/CT, SPECT), ultrasound imaging scanners, and similar equipment.

The government requires maintenance services that include an escalation system, such that if a technician can not determine the problem within a reasonable time, the problem is referred to a senior technician, and should that person not be able to correct the problem, more senior personnel or the products hardware/software engineers can be tasked with solving he problem, maintaining uptime for the system in excess of 98%.  

The government requires compliance with the DoD and Federal Information Assurance regulations.

<DESC>The Digital Imaging Network - Picture Archiving and Communications System (DIN-PACS) is an open system network of digital devices designed for the effective acquisition, transmission, display, and management of diagnostic imaging studies. DIN-PACS provides for diagnostic x-ray images in digital output that can be transmitted for analysis anywhere in the hospital or in the world. DIN-PACS support the business process changes throughout the Military Health System (MHS) and, especially, within the practice of military radiology. The vision for radiology is to create a "virtual" radiology department by eliminating multiple "place" constraints that arise both within and between diagnostic centers. Within facilities the DIN-PACS system is intended to eliminate the necessity of creating film and allow access to images by multiple users at any place and anytime. Between facilities, the system is intended to create opportunities to dynamically shift workload at anytime and to any location where clinical expertise is available.<br />DIN-PACS includes:<br />01A.

<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with Miltec Corporation, located at 678 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, AL 35806-2802. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to Miltec Corporation under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3) and in accordance with FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(iii): services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of high specialized services. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The associated NAICS code for this procurement is 541712. This is not a Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, nor a set-aside program. The closing date for this combined synopsis/solicitation is November 30, 2009, 4:00pm ET. This document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17.

MDA competitively awarded HQ0006-07-D-0004, a CPFF, IDIQ contract, to Miltec Corporation.  Under this contract, Miltec is to execute flight test planning and prepare flight test payloads for qualification and producibility testing.  The experiments are used to assess flight hardware componentry and subassembly parts for potential insertion approval into the Ballistic Missile Defense Program.  The contract was issued to support Flight Experiment (FE) 1 and 2.  The contract ceiling of $4.8M has been reached with the award of Task Order 0002.  The contract ceiling was arrived at sooner than planned due to unanticipated problems for which Miltec was not at fault.  Further flight test planning and payload preparation are still required for FE 2, and therefore MDA intends to issue a modification to the current contract, raising the ceiling in the amount of $5M.

The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received within 15 days of this notice. The applicable NAICS code is 541712. The determination to proceed on a sole source basis is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses to this announcement should be sent to the following address within 15 days of this notice: Missile Defense Agency (MDA)/DACV, Attention: Mily H. Le, 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-7100. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS.

<DESC>The following questions were asked and the answers are contained herein.  There is NOT an extention regarding the closing of this RFP as a result of this new information.

1) In regards to geometry, does the radome need to be cylindrical as shown in the sketch or will a spherical radome be acceptable?
 
RESPONSE:  It does not matter if the radome is cylindrical or spherical as long as it meets all environmental characteristics (i.e. wind, weather, rain shedding, lighting etc), Radio Frequency (RF) characteristics and specifications listed in the RFP.
 
 
2) Total height when the "rod" antenna is deployed is 17.75'.  What is the height of the overall structure when that antenna is in the stowed position (i.e. to the top of the rotating dish in Figure 3-2 of the RFP)?
 
RESPONSE:  Figure 3-2 in the RFP does not depict a complete stowed position.  In a complete stowed position not only does the PAR antenna (rod) fold down but also the ASR antenna (rotating dish) folds down to a stowed position.  The height of a complete stowed SYSTEM is 9'.  The height from the ground to the top of the ASR Antenna in figure 3-2 of the RFP is 16'.  Recommend a margin be developed around the system as it rolls in/out of the Radome, for example 4-feet.
 
3) Is a door that is created by removing multiple panels acceptable, or does the door have to be one single piece or roll-up?
 
RESPONSE:  Any one (1) of these options are acceptable as long as the door enables expeditious roll in / roll out capability as stated in the RFP section 3.2.2 Site Installation.  We believe it would be more suitable to have a roll up door vice de-construction the radome panels, especially wrt tools, lost hardware, time, and weight. 


Additional modification 
Question #3: "all pieces are two-man liftable" 

 
4) Does the radome have to be 30' in diameter at the base, or can it be slightly smaller at the mounting points of the base (i.e. just under 25' dia), such that the maximum diameter at any point of the radome is then never greater than 30'?
 
RESPONSE:  RFP Figure 3-3 shows that with a radome with a 30' base diameter provides 10.625' on each side of the High Mobility Multi Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  This was requested in order to allow both the ASR enclosure door to be open, the PAR enclosure door to be open, and still allow an instructor and several students to move freely around the HMMWV.  With a base diameter of 25', this will allow ONLY 8.125' of clearance on either side of the HMMWV.  The ~8-foot clearance will NOT adequate based on human factors, the "internal" dimension of the Radome must not shrink beyond 30-feet (i.e., NLT 30-feet) at the base to support the acceptable guidelines. 
 
5)  In addition to the already specified frequency bands of operation for each antenna could we please get details on: the sizes, polarizations, and aperture illumination tapers of each?

RESPONSE: 
 
PAR: 
           Power: 1000W peak
           Polarization: Circular
                Azimuth Antenna

The Navy operates and maintains 140 Dunlop Anti Boat Barriers (DABBs) in the San Diego Bay area for force protection purposes.   Eighty of the units are located at Naval Air Station North Island and sixty are located at SUBASE Point Loma.  The individual DABB modules are a rubberized fabric cylinder 8-feet in diameter and 82-feet long filled with low pressure air.  The individual units are connected between buoys to form barrier strings around the ship berths.  The DABB barriers require periodic inspection and inflation as part of regular system maintenance.  The DABB modules are inflated through an air valve in the end flange using a low pressure air source such as a commercial gas powered "leaf blower."  Base Year CLIN 0001, Maintenance services to inspect and inflate DABBs. The contractor shall provide daily inspection and inflation of the DABB barriers in order to maintain an internal air pressure between 2-3 PSIG.    The contractor shall maintain a written weekly log of barrier units inspected and those requiring inflation.  Chronic leaks shall be noted and reported.  The inspection shall also include a visual check for tears and connector condition.  Units requiring repairs to the DABB rubber fabric or connectors shall be reported in the log.  The weekly log shall be forwarded in electronic format to the Contracting Officer and Technical Representative as directed.    Past experience with these systems indicated that 2-3 hours a day is sufficient for a boat and crew to accomplish these tasks at both sites.  Assume for quoting purposes that a government furnished vessel (suitable for task) will be made available for all work covered by this SOW.  Process for requesting vessel will be later defined and controlled by SW Port Operations. Base Year CLIN 00002 Materials and Supplies, a not-to-exceed (NTE) amount of $5,000.00 will be added into the contract but not evaluated.  Do not include the NTE amount in your quote. Contractors shall furnish and bill the actual cost for materials and supplies supported by paid invoices.  As part of your quote, separately identify all mark-ups including any surcharge and/or handling fee for supplies furnished during normal business hours and also those applicable, if different for materials and supplies furnished after normal business hours.  Base Year CLIN 0003, Labor Hours (Option Item) NTE 110 overtime hours.  Contractors shall provide burdened hourly rate for overtime.   Contractor is responsible to obtain advance written approval from the designated Contracting Officer's Representative or Navy Technical Representative prior to working any overtime.  CLIN 0004, Option Period 1, Maintenance services to inspect and inflate DABBs; CLIN 0005 Option Period 1, Materials & Supplies NTE $5,000.00; CLIN 0006 Option Period 1, Labor Hours (Option item) NTE 54 overtime hours; CLIN 0007, Option Period 2, Maintenance services to inspect and inflate DABBs; CLIN 0008 Option Period 2, Materials & Supplies NTE $5,000.00; CLIN 0009 Option Period 2, Labor Hours (Option item) NTE 54 overtime hours.  Note:  CLINS 0002, 0005, and 0006 The NTE amount for materials will be adjusted to include the negotiated mark-up for normal and after hours service using 90/10 split.  Contractor shall submit Schedule B along with their quote.

<DESC>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technologies that will enable the integration of several disparate command and control display elements (CCDE) into a single CCDE. The Air Force will use this information to make informed decisions about an acquisition strategy for this project. The intent is NOT to settle on a particular technology or product at this time, but rather to assess the capabilities available in the marketplace today and their costs, identify the pros and cons associated with implementing a certain type of solution, and to receive feedback on requirements and architecture views that have been developed for this effort. There are no definitive plans to procure an actual solution at this time.

<DESC>The OWL radar provides the ability to detect, track and locate mortar, cannon and rocket firing positions automatically, when fired in a variety of situations. This includes conventional indirect weapon fires, in addition to, weapons fired with non-standard trajectories. The system also has the ability to provide the location of weapons fired in mountainous terrain from elevations both above and below the radar. The OWL provides high-quality track data on mortar, cannon, and rocket targets in order to be fully capable of providing a cue for handoff to fire control systems. Additionally, the system provides quality impact point prediction with sufficient warning to improve force protection and take responsive measures in a timely manner. The system also incorporates advanced techniques for system self-protection against Electronic Attack, i.e., jamming and deception.

<DESC>Evaluation/Award decision process has been changed and the following applies:


CAUTION NOTICE


In the past, most Best Value Clothing and Textile solicitations utilized Best Value Trade Off Procedures, however, This acquisition is utilizing the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Best Value Method.  As such, no "trade off" applies and the Government intends to award to the low priced firm who is compliant with terms of the solicitation, and deemed "technically acceptable."  Also, unlike previous acquisitions for commercial items, there will be no allowable re-submittals for PDM and only firms with satisfactory or better PDMs will be eligible for award.  Technical Acceptability is being defined herein as satisfactory, very good or exceptional PDMs.  All PDMs will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria outlined in the solicitation.  

From among technically acceptable firms, the Government will then select the lowest price offeror and determine if that firm is responsible, complies with terms and conditions of the solicitation and an award to them is in the best interest of the Government.  If that firm fits these criteria, award will be made to them.  If not, the Government will review each subsequent technically acceptable low priced offer until one is identified that does meet the criteria, in which case award will be made to that firm.

The Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with a competitive range group of offerors from among technically acceptable firms, based on price.  If negotiations are conducted, award will be made to low priced offer (based on final proposal revision closing, date/time) that is technically acceptable, responsible and compliant with solicitation terms and conditions.

<DESC>This is a revised Sources Sought to announcement A1000000302 issued December 7, 2009.
GENERAL: The National Park Service, Department of Interior, is conducting a sources sought for the work described below. This notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. The amount of interest will determine the possibility of a set-aside or full and open competition. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid. NPS would like interested parties to submit related project experience and resumes for key individuals to Rebecca Bizier at Rebecca_Bizier@nps.gov, or via fax to 303-987-5081 by close of business Monday, December 21, 2009.  Clearly identify your firm's size status and provide your DUNS number in your response.  Your response should also identify which geographic areas identified below your firm is interested in.
The NAICS code for this work is 237310.
Projects may be subject to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Work will include, but is not limited to analysis of existing conditions, development of typical paving sections and paving mixes, any required permits, installation of asphalt pavement, concrete pavement, crack sealing, chip seal, aggregate base, shoulder treatments, ditch installation and/or repair, culvert repair, removal, and/or installation, striping and other pavement markings, rumble strips, signage, traffic control, pavement obliteration, guardrail installation, guardwall repair and/or installation, utility repair and / or replacement, bridge repair and /or replacement, and tree trimming and /or removal. Work may also include curbing, gutters, sidewalks, pedestrian trails, and multi-use trails.
Work will potentially occur throughout the Northeast, Southeast, and National Capital Regions. The three regions contain over 200 sites that serve more than 100 million visitors annually.  The parks of these regions contain thousands of historic structures and archeological sites, hundreds of miles of trails, bike paths, riverfront, seashores, scenic parkways, and historic canals, numerous statues, presidential memorials, historic forts, Civil War battlefields, and the White House. Despite ongoing repair and maintenance, the road and trail systems in these regions continue to deteriorate. The National Park Service (NPS) seeks interest from experts in the road construction industry capable of providing professional engineering services, construction document services, construction services, and ongoing rehabilitation services of the road and trail system networks.
In some cases, recommendations for pavement treatments may have been developed.  Work may include validating those recommendations and submitting alternate design recommendations when characteristics of materials, project conditions, weather, test results or other circumstances warrant adjustments. 
TYPE OF PROCUREMENT:  NPS is exploring the possibility of soliciting and awarding several multiple year construction Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) to satisfy this need and is trying to determine the contractor interest, availability, and expertise for this type of requirement.  
The NPS is considering separating the work based upon the below geographic areas and dollar values into four multiple award pools of IDIQ contracts.  These boundaries and contract values are subject to change based upon the responses received to this announcement and further market research.
New England IDIQs: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut with an estimated contract value of $10-20 Million per contract over the life of the IDIQ.
Northeast IDIQs: New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania with an estimated contract value of $30-40 Million per contract over the life of the IDIQ.
Mid-Atlantic IDIQs: District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia with an estimated contract value of $75 Million per contract over the life of the IDIQ.
Southeastern IDIQs: North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Tennessee with an estimated contract value of $40-50 Million per contract over the life of the IDIQ.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  

The Government is limiting consideration to General Service Administration Contractors, with a GSA Schedule contract Special Item Number(S), (70) INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT), (541) ADVERTISING & INTEGRATED MARKETING SOLUTIONS (AIMS), AND (874) MISSION ORIENTED BUSINESS INTEGRATED SERVICES (MOBIS) (SIN)  and 874.


The Department of Health and Human Services intends to award a GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract.  The purpose of this requirement is to provide technical support to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the Department of Health and Human Services for the development and conduct of training courses and related materials to educate staff from the offices of state attorneys general and others about the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules.  

BACKGROUND
The OCR promotes and ensures that people have equal access to and opportunity to participate in and receive services from all HHS-funded programs without facing unlawful discrimination, and that the privacy of their health information is protected.  OCR has primary responsibility for implementation and enforcement of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which provides important health information privacy protections and rights for individuals. OCRs enforcement activities include investigation of alleged violations and initiation of compliance reviews to determine compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 160 and 164 Subpart E).  OCR is committed to developing and enforcing strong health information privacy protections that do not impede access to quality health care.  For more information about OCR enforcement of the Privacy Rule, see http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/index.html.

The Privacy Rule is one of a suite of regulations (including the Security Rule (45 CFR 160 and 164 Subpart C) and Standards for Transactions and Code Sets (45 CFR 160 and 162)) promulgated pursuant to the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA.
Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Pub. L. No. 111-5,  13411, 123 Stat. 115, 276 (2009), Congress provided additional tools for enforcement of these administrative simplification requirements.  Among other new provisions, ARRA authorizes a State Attorney General (AG) to bring an action on behalf of state residents to enjoin a defendant from further violation or to obtain damages.  This new enforcement authority requires coordination between HHS and state attorneys general and provides HHS with the means to intervene in state actions.  

To assist state attorneys general in their efforts to exercise their new enforcement authority and promote productive and effective enforcement relationships with them, OCR will develop and convene a series of training seminars focused on enforcement of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.  OCR will also develop and make available the training in other modalities to ensure continuing access to the instruction. This request for proposals seeks a Contractor to provide support in the development and delivery of training and other outreach materials and tools in a variety of modalities.  Classroom training seminars will be conducted by HHS staff, with logistical support from the Contractor.

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): HDT Engineering Services, Inc., W911QY-10-C-0021 for Lightweight, Flexible, Cost Effective Solar Energy Photov<br><br>A firm fixed price contract has been awarded to HDT Engineering Services, Inc. 415 Wolfe St., Fredericksburg, VA in response to solicitation W911QY-BAA-09-11-1 for Topic Area 8.d for new technologies that will benefit shelter electrical systems such as high efficiency lighting and field photovoltaic systems.  The research and development effort will focus on research, development, characterization and integrations of new energy storage solutions into the contractors existing Expeditionary Power System (EPS).  The system consists of three components, each of which is man-portable: a Balance of Systems (BOS) control unit, an Expandable Battery Pack (EBP), and a flexible thin-film Expandable Solar Array (ESA).  This product may be used to provide 24 VDC power to shelter, military vehicles, communication devices, lighting, unmanned aerial vehicle control systems, and weapons systems and could be connected to an inverter to provide power to most 120 VAC applications.  The goal of this effort is to develop a replacement alternative EBP utilizing ruggedized lithium-ion battery technology.  Due to its man-portability, it could be used anywhere in the operating theatre, and several systems could be banked and used as an energy cushion or used as the main energy source for small power grid systems.  The period of performance will be for twelve months commencing on December 15, 2009 through December 14, 2010.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): HDT Engineering Services, Inc., W911QY-10-C-0020 for Lightweight, Flexible Cost Effective Solar Energy Photovo<br><br>A firm fixed price contract has been awarded to HDT Engineering Services, Inc. 415 Wolfe St., Fredericksburg, VA in response to solicitation W911QY-BAA-09-11-1 for Topic Area 8.d for new technologies that will benefit shelter electrical systems such as high efficiency lighting and field photovoltaic systems.  The research and development effort will focus on the design, development, and production of prototype single and three-phase microgrids to manage multiple EPS inputs augmented as needed by fuel-fired generators.  Smart-Fault tolerance, allowing the system to continue to provide power as individual components fail or are taken off-line is a critical attribute of the grid.  The microgrid will include intelligent generator controls for integrating the Tactically Quiet Generator (TQG) family into the network as a backup or as auxiliary power during periods of peak demand.  Grid tie technologies will be integrated, maximizing the benefits of alternative power sources when combined with an intelligent generator network.  The modularity and mobility of the system makes it applicable for many military and civilian uses, whether expeditionary or semi-permanent, and provides increased Warfighter sustainability through reduced fuel consumption and increase power reliability. The period of performance will be for twelve months commencing on December 15, 2009 through December 14, 2010.

<DESC>RECOVERYTHIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ08UA00017.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to the MINACT, Inc under contract number DOLJ08UA00017.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps intends to award a modification in the amount of $52,464 to the BL Hooks Job Corps Center, operated by MINACT, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceiling for Equipment on this contract.

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:  1) CTT auto and construction curriculum to enhance training opportunities to the students of the BL Hooks Job Corps Center; and 2) to be directed to electric and electric hybrid vehicles for operation on Job Corps centers. These funds may be used for all expenses related to the acquisition of electric vehicles, including purchase of vehicles, shipping and delivery costs, training on use of vehicle, and additional equipment such as batteries and supplies. In addition, Job Corps centers with automotive career technical training (CTT) programs will use this opportunity to acquire electric hybrid vehicles as student training aids, to provide hands-on technical training in green vehicle technologies. 

This Modification has been awarded on December 8, 2009.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />10 U.S.C. 2304(e)(2)<br />Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as<br />implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3 and in accordance with the requirements of FAR<br />6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.3 is<br />justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows:<br />l. Agency and Contracting Activity.<br />The United States Coast Guard, (USCG) Surfaces Forces Logistics Center, LRE-Product Line,<br />proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition;<br />2. Nature andlor description of the action heing approved.<br />The USCG has a requirement to perform and overhaul, and return to service USCGC<br />BERTHOLF's #2 Main Propulsion Diesel Engine (MPDE) cylinder heads at an estimated cost of<br />$134.000.<br />Proposed Contractor:<br />MTU Detroit Diesel Incorporated<br />13400 Outer Drive West<br />Detroit, M1482339<br />MTU Detroit Diesel is a subsidiary of:<br />MTU Aero Engines GmbH<br />Daehauer Str. 665<br />80995 Miinehen<br />Germany<br />Tel. +49 891489-0<br />Fax +49 89 1489-5500<br />MTU Detroit Diesel Incorporated is the sole authorized representative of MTU Aero Engines<br />GmbH for this engine in the United States.<br />3. Description of Supplies/Services.<br />The requirement is to conduct removal of and overhaul and tinal re-assembly of the 20 cylinder<br />heads on to the #2 MPDE in order to return it to service in the USCGC BERTHOLF at an<br />estimated cost of$134,000. Thcse repair stems from the catastrophic casualty suffered to the # I<br />MPDE on 22 August 2009 during BERTHOLF's last deployment. (CASREP INITIAL-09055CAT<br />3)). Because MTU Dctroit Diesel, Inc., the representativc ofMTU Acro Engines GmbH,<br />the Original Equipment Manufacturcr (OEM), is the only known U. S. company that has the<br />requircd information and tcchnical knowlcdge of this MTU engine design, a Sole Source contract<br />(HSCG85-1 O-C-P45207) was awarded to thcm to tcar down and repair this engine. In the eourse<br />of this work all the cylinder heads were removed from the # I MPDE. Upon inspection it was<br />found that all had suffered degradation, such as cracked exhaust valves, corrosive damage on<br />valve shafts, pit corrosion on valve heads, and corrosive build up on cylinder heads, all as more<br />fully described in Condition Found Report 002 to the referenced contract.<br />Bt.'Cause of the extensive damage to the cylinder heads on the #1 MPDE, it was detcnnined that it<br />would be prudent to inspect thc #2 MPDE cylinder heads. This inspection revealed that thc<br />cylinder heads on this engine also showed the same conditions. It is necessary to begin the<br />immediatc removal and overhaul of all #2 MPDE cylinder heads to insure that this engine can be<br />returned to sClVice within the time frame provided to repair and return to selViee the #1 MPDE.<br />A CAT 3 CASREP (INITIAL-99999) has been released on this engine.<br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open<br />Competition.<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2)<br />implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-2 entitled "Unusual<br />and compelling urgency".<br />5. Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Require Use of the Authority Cited.<br />This requiremcnt is to remove all 20 cylinder heads from the #2 MPDE, remove them from the<br />ship and take them to an appropriate facility where they can be further disassembled and rebuilt.<br />MTU-DD has identified approximately $83,000 in parts that must be replaced. Many ofthesc<br />parts must be ordered from the factory in Gcnnany and some have lead time of at least weeks. In<br />addition these parts must pass through U. S. Customs, which may entail additional delays.<br />USCGC BERTHOLF is currently in-port in Alameda, CA undergoing extensive modification to<br />upgrade its operational capability. USCGC BERTHOLF is scheduled to get undcf....ay on or<br />about I February 201 0 for an operational patrol.<br />MTU Detroit Diesel has provided a detailed disassembly and overhaul schedule. This schedule,<br />based on placing the necessary order for parts by 20 November 2009, shows that the earliest<br />estimated completion datc of these repairs is IS January 201 O. Without proceeding with thcse<br />repairs on a sole~souree basis there is a very strong possibility that USCGC BERTHOLF will not<br />be ablc to get undcfvay for its assigned operations on the date specified by it Operational<br />Commander. The failure of USCGC BERTHOLF to execute its required mission will adversely<br />affect the defense posture of the United States. This is considered unacceptable.<br />6. Dcscription of cfforts madc to ensurc that offers arc solicited from as many potential<br />sources as is practicablc.<br />No FcdBizOpps notice was or will be publicized, as required by FAR Subpart 5.1 02(a)(6) and<br />5.2. The exception under FAR 5.202 that applies is FAR 5.202(a)(2).<br />7. Detcrmination by the Contracting Officcr that the Anticipated Cost to the<br />Government will be Fair and Reasonable.<br />A pricc analysis will be pcrfonned to insure that a fair and reasonable price is negotiated in<br />accordance with FAR 15.404.<br />8. Description of Market Research. Market Research is required by FAR Part 10.<br />The internet was scarcht.-'d for firms that could provide parts for and/or repair the MTU 1163<br />series MOPE. Only MTU Aero Engines Gmbll and MTU Detroit Diesel Incorporated (for<br />companies located in the U. S.) have any postings regarding servicing these engines. There<br />appear to be no other companies capable of making these repairs, nor could any other company<br />have access to the critically required parts faster than MTU-Detroit Diesel.<br />9. Any Otbcr Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than FuU and Open Competition.<br />The #1 MPDE is a MTU Model 1163 series engine is a high perfonnance engine that was<br />specifically modified for usc in the Coast Guard's new National Security Cutter class of ships.<br />Its marine application in the U. S. is therefore new. This application is currently only installed in<br />two Coast Guard Cullers (USCGC BERTHOLF and USCGC WAESCHE, which has not yet<br />been delivered to the Coast Guard), and to the best knowledge of the Coast Guard is not uscd in<br />any other marine application in the United States. Therefore, the infonnation, teclmical<br />knowledge, and experience required to conduct Ihese repairs is not available from anyone within<br />the United States other than MTU Detroit Diesellneorporated and its parent company.<br />(0. A I.isting of the Sources, if Any, That Expressed, in Vriting, an Interest in the<br />Acquisition.<br />one<br />II. A Statement of the Actions, if An}', the Agency May Take to Remove or<br />Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for<br />Supplies or Services Required.<br />Market research indicates thai there currently does not exist any viable alternative to MTU Aero<br />Engines GmbH, as the OEM, and MTU Detroit Diesel Incorporated, as its authorized service<br />reprcscntative in the U. S. for these engines. Currently only extensive training of the USCGC<br />BERTHOLF crew will allow the Coast Guard to have organic capability to repair these engines.<br />As the Coast Guard gains more experience and acquires technical expertise it may be able to<br />identify other repair options.<br />12. Contracting Officer's Certification.<br />I certify that the data supporting thc recommended use of other than full and open competition is<br />accurate and complete to the best ofmy knowledge and belief; and<br />13. Technical/Requirements PersonncJ Certification.<br />I certify that this requirement mccts the Government's minimum need and that the supporting<br />data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate.<br />1&amp;~(~~<br />Date<br />APPROVAL:<br />GB;d:n~<br />Contracting Officer: Date<br />II 11'3/oj
